It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did the right thing by telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is affecting her ability to find a partner. The friend was being insulting and the user finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had been making hurtful comments about the user's body, work, and dating life for two years. The user tried to brush it off with polite responses. Then, when confronted, the user pointed out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her dating struggles. The friend flipped out, and mutual friends are now criticizing the user.\n\nThe user feels they were defending themselves against untrue, low-quality insults. They think they were just being honest. But the mutual friends are saying the user has \"skinny privilege\" and is being a bad friend. The user is defensive, arguing they worked hard for their success and aren't entitled.\n\nSo, was the user in the wrong? Well, even if the comment was true, delivering it in that context might be a problem. The user was responding to insults, which could be seen as defending themselves. However, bringing up personal issues like the friend's child support and number of children might be crossing a line, even if it's true. Friends might see it as a personal attack rather than a constructive response.\n\nAlso, the user's job in the adult industry is a sensitive topic. Even if the friend tried it, bringing that up could be seen as using a personal flaw against them. The user's response might have been a justified reaction to being insulted, but the way it was delivered and the content might not have been the best approach.\n\nMutual friends' reactions suggest that the user overstepped. Even if the user felt entitled to respond, the comment might have been too harsh or public, leading to the fallout. The user might not be in the wrong for speaking up after being attacked, but the method and content could be problematic. It's a gray area. However, since the user was responding to insults, there might be some justification. But the key is whether the response was appropriate. The user's answer might have been truthful but not the wisest choice in maintaining the friendship. So, leaning towards A (in the wrong) because the response could be seen as attacking the friend's personal life, even if provoked. Alternatively, B (not wrong) because they were defending themselves against untrue insults. Hmm. It's tricky. The user's comment was factual but delivered in a confrontational way, which might make them at fault. So maybe A.\n"
