It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her friend that her multiple kids with different fathers are why she's single. The friend had been making hurtful comments, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend has been making repeated, insulting remarks about the author's appearance and dating life over two years. The author tried to brush them off but eventually responded by pointing out the friend's situation. Now the friend is upset, and mutual friends are criticizing the author.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior versus the author's response. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and personal, even if they were her own issues. The author, after enduring this for a long time, gave a direct answer that addressed the root of the friend's problems. \n\nHowever, the author's response about the five kids and child support might have been a sensitive topic. Even if true, bringing up such a personal and potentially stigmatizing issue could be seen as cutting, even if the friend was being mean. The mutual friends are now taking the side of the friend, mentioning \"skinny privilege\" and the author being entitled. But the author feels she's not privileged and that she's worked hard.\n\nI need to decide if the author's response was justified. While the friend's comments were awful, the author's answer might have crossed a line by targeting a core issue of the friend's life. Even if the truth is valid, the way it's delivered in the heat of the moment can hurt. The friend was already in a vulnerable state, and the author's reply might have been the final straw. The friends might be influenced by the emotional impact of the situation, seeing the author as the aggressor even if the initial insults were bad.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The friend's behavior was inexcusable, but the response might not have been the best approach. Maybe there's a better way to address it without attacking the friend's personal situation. The author was trying to be honest, but honesty doesn't always excuse harshness. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because while defending against insults is natural, the response could have been more constructive or empathetic.\n"
