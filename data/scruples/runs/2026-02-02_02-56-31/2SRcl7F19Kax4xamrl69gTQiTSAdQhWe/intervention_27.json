It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for telling their friend about her situation with the five kids and the child support. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe friend has five kids from different fathers, all divorced, and the user is tired of her insults. The friend's comments are personal, like questioning how the user got a man at 30, implying it's because she's skinny, and making jokes about eating. The user tried to brush them off with responses like \"focus on yourself.\" Finally, the friend confronts the user about why she can't get dates, and the user responds by pointing out her five kids and lack of child support from the fathers.\n\nNow, the user is being criticized by mutual friends for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, even though the user works hard and has her own issues. The user feels wronged and is upset that the friends don't understand her perspective.\n\nFirst, I should consider whether the user's response was appropriate. The user was responding to two years of insults and felt the need to address the root issue. The friend's behavior seems to be toxic and hurtful, but the user's direct answer might have crossed a line. However, the user was just stating a factual observation about their friend's situation, which is a real challenge. But maybe the way it was delivered was too harsh or not supportive.\n\nThe user's friend might have felt shamed or judged, which could explain her reaction. The user's response was honest but perhaps not empathetic. It's possible that the user should have approached the conversation differently, offering support while addressing the issue. However, the user was defending themselves after repeated insults, so it's a tough situation.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that they don't support the user's approach, possibly because they see it as attacking the friend's personal situation. But the user is also a single parent with two kids and a non-traditional job, which might add complexity.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The user was defending themselves after being insulted, but the response might have been too direct. There might be a better way to address the issue without shaming the friend. However, the user's statement is a factual truth that could be valid in explaining the friend's difficulties. The key is whether the user was entitled to express that truth in that context, considering the history of insults.\n\nI think the user's response, while honest, might have been too harsh given the ongoing tension. The user had a right to set boundaries and address the insults, but maybe a kinder approach could have been better. However, since the user was being attacked, their reaction is understandable. The friends' reactions might be missing the point of the user's long-term struggle with the friend's insults. So, the user might not be in the wrong, but there could have been a better way to handle it.\n"
