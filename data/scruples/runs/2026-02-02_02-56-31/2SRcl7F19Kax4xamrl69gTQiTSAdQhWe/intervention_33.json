It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is affecting her ability to find someone. The friend had been making insulting comments for two years, and the user finally called out the truth.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the dynamics here. The friend's behavior is clearly toxic\u2014making personal comments that are not only rude but also imply that the user's success is based on superficial traits. The user tried to brush it off initially, which is understandable as they might have wanted to avoid conflict. But after repeated insults, they felt compelled to respond with the truth, which the friend took as an attack.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the insults and the user's intent. The user's response was a factual statement about the friend's circumstances, not an outright insult. The friend's actions\u2014having five children with different fathers and no child support\u2014could indeed make it harder to attract a partner. The user's reply was a direct but honest assessment of the situation, which the friend took as a personal attack.\n\nThe mutual friends are criticizing the user for having \"skinny privilege\" or being entitled, but the user argues they've worked hard. The friend's comments were untrue and low-quality, so the user's response was in defense of their own worth. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh, even if the content was true. Maybe there was a more constructive way to express the same sentiment without sounding accusatory.\n\nThe user's job in the adult industry is being judged by the friend as well, which adds another layer of tension. The user has valid reasons to be defensive. The question is whether pointing out the friend's behavior was the right approach. In relationships, honesty is important, but it's also about how it's communicated. The user might not be in the wrong for speaking their mind, especially after so much provocation, but perhaps could have handled it more tactfully. However, given the context, their response was a justified defense against ongoing insults.\n"
