It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's still single because she has five kids with different dads and no child support. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe friend has five kids with different fathers, all divorced, and hasn't received child support. The friend was making a lot of comments that the person found insulting, questioning their weight, their job, their dating life. The person tried to brush off the insults with generic advice, but finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation as a reason for her difficulties. The friend went into a rage and hung up. Now, mutual friends are saying the person is privileged and a bad friend, while the person feels they're not and that they worked hard for their success.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the comments made. The friend's statements are clearly hurtful and judgmental. They're attacking the person's weight, their job, and implying that their success in dating is due to superficial reasons. The person tried to ignore these insults for two years, which is a long time. When the friend continued to push, the person finally responded with their honest opinion about why the friend might be struggling. \n\nThe key point here is whether the response was justified. The person's comment was about the friend's own situation\u2014five different fathers and lack of child support. This is a factual observation, but it's also a sensitive topic. Even if true, bringing it up can be seen as cruel, especially if the friend is already vulnerable. The person might have intended to help, but the way it was delivered could have been hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was toxic. She was constantly making hurtful comments, and the person was defending themselves. If the friend's actions were part of a pattern of bullying, then the person might feel justified in standing up for themselves. However, the response was direct and pointed out a specific issue, which might have crossed a line.\n\nThe mutual friends' reaction suggests that the person's comment was perceived as harsh, even if the friend was in the wrong with her insults. The phrase \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often leads to a community judgment on whether the actions were appropriate. In many such cases, even if someone is being attacked, a direct and potentially embarrassing response might be seen as going too far.\n\nAdditionally, the person's own situation includes having two kids with the same dad and a more stable job, which might create a contrast that the friend is pointing out. The person's response could be seen as highlighting that contrast, but in a way that's blunt and possibly shaming.\n\nI think the crux here is that while the friend's behavior was inexcusable, the response might have been too direct and personal. There might be a better way to address the issue without attacking the friend's circumstances. The person's intention was to be honest, but honesty isn't always the best approach when it's delivered in a way that's hurtful, even if the content is true.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the person might be in the wrong for the way they responded, even if the friend was being a jerk. The response could have been more constructive or delivered with more empathy. The mutual friends' reactions align with that view, as they felt the comment was too harsh. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, if the person's comment was a direct response to years of insults, maybe it's understandable. However, the community often sides with maintaining friendship even in tough situations unless the behavior is extremely toxic. In this case, the friend's comments were ongoing and hurtful, but the response might not be the appropriate way to handle it. So I think the answer is A.\n"
