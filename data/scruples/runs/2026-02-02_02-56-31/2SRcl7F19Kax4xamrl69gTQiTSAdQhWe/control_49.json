It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend has five kids with different fathers and none of them pay child support. The author's friend keeps making comments that are insulting and seem to belittle the author's life choices. For two years, the author brushes off these insults with some polite replies.\n\nThen, when the friend asks again why she can't get dates, the author responds by pointing out that having five kids with different dads might make it hard for someone to commit. The friend gets angry and hangs up. Now the author is getting backlash from mutual friends who say the author is being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. The author was defending themselves after being insulted repeatedly. The friend's comments were personal attacks, like questioning the author's weight and implying that being a blonde and girly is what got them dates. The author's response is pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason. But is that crossing a line?\n\nEven if the author's statement is true, was it a good idea to bring it up? The friend's behavior was clearly toxic, and the author was tired of being insulted. However, bringing up the friend's personal issues might be seen as attacking her character rather than addressing her behavior. The friends are saying the author is being mean and entitled, which could be because they feel the author is using the friend's situation against her instead of just ignoring the insults.\n\nAnother angle: the author's job is in the adult industry, which the friend also tried but failed. The friend might be projecting her own insecurities onto the author. The author's response, while honest, might have been a harsh way to confront the friend's issues. Instead of pointing out the friend's problems, maybe the author should have redirected the conversation or set boundaries without attacking the friend's personal life.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's response was a valid defense or if it was an aggressive move that made things worse. Since the friend was already being confrontational, the author might feel justified in pointing out the obvious. However, in terms of friendship, it's often better to avoid attacking someone's personal circumstances, even if they're true. The author's friends probably think the author escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nSo, while the author might feel they were defending themselves, the method used could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the response was a personal attack rather than a defense against the friend's insults. Alternatively, B could be argued if the insults were so bad that the author was justified in pushing back.\n"
