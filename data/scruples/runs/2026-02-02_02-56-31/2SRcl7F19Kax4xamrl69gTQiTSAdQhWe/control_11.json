It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between two friends. The author's friend has been through five divorces and now has five kids with different fathers. The friend has been making comments that the author finds insulting. The author tried to brush them off but finally snapped and told the friend that her situation with the kids is making it hard for her to find a partner. Now, the author is getting backlash from mutual friends who think she's being privileged and entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was making repeated, insulting comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author felt she was just brushing it off but then decided to confront the root cause of the friend's issues. The friend took it as an insult and ended the conversation. The mutual friends are now criticizing the author for being rude and not understanding her friend's situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's comments were clearly hurtful and possibly untrue. The author was defensive because the friend was attacking her lifestyle and work. When the friend asked a question that implied the author's success was due to being skinny or other superficial reasons, the author pointed out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her own dating struggles. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The author's answer was honest, but was it tactless? The friend might have felt that the author was blaming her for her own choices, even if those choices are difficult. The mutual friends are pointing out that the author might have privilege, which the author denies. \n\nHowever, the friend's repeated insults and the author's defense of her own choices might have led to a situation where the author felt cornered. The author's response was a direct answer to a question, but it's possible that there was a more compassionate way to phrase it without attacking the friend's circumstances. The author might not be in the wrong for responding honestly, but she could have handled it better. However, given the friend's behavior, maybe the author had a right to express her opinion, even if it was blunt.\n\nOn the other hand, mutual friends are saying the author is being unkind, which suggests that her response crossed a line. The friend's situation is complex, and pointing out the challenges without phrasing it as a personal attack might have been better. The author's comment might come across as judgmental, even if it's true. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more empathetic in her response. \n\nBut the friend was the one making the initial insults. The author was defending herself and giving a truthful answer to a question. The friend's reaction is also extreme, hanging up and being in an \"insult fury.\" The mutual friends' reactions might be influenced by their own biases. The author is working hard, has an MBA, and a stable job, which might make her feel she's being unfairly judged. \n\nIn conclusion, the situation is nuanced. The author's response was honest but perhaps not delivered with enough consideration for her friend's feelings. However, given the friend's prior behavior, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because the response was a direct attack on the friend's circumstances, even if it's true. Alternatively, B (No) because the friend was being insincere first. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer might be A because the author's response was a personal jab, even if it's true, which might not be the best approach in a friendship. So, A.\n"
