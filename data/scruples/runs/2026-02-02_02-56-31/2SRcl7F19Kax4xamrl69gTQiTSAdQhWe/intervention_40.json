It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is affecting her dating life. The friend had been making insults and the user finally responded with the truth they believed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had a history of making personal and insulting comments, which the user had tried to brush off. The user's response came after years of this behavior. The friend's actions were clearly hurtful and ongoing. \n\nThe user's reply was a direct point about the friend's situation affecting her ability to find a partner. While the statement might be true, it's important to consider how it was delivered. The user might have been trying to be honest, but the method could have been harsh. \n\nHowever, the friend had a pattern of making low-quality insults, and the user was defending their own experiences. The user also mentions working hard for their achievements and having a stable situation with their children, unlike the friend. \n\nNow, considering the mutual friends' reactions, they accused the user of being privileged and a bad friend. But the user feels they are not entitled and have earned their success. This adds complexity to the social dynamics. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's intention was to address the root cause they saw in the friend's dating struggles. While the truth can be hard to hear, especially in a sensitive situation, the user might have been justified in pointing out the obvious. However, the way it was said could have been more empathetic. \n\nBut given the friend's history of insults and the user's attempts to ignore them until now, the user's response might be seen as a last resort. The key is whether the user crossed a line. Since the user was addressing a valid concern and had been provoked, it's possible they weren't in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, even if the friend was being rude, the user's response might have been a personal attack. The line between honesty and cruelty can be thin. But the user's statement was a factual observation, not a personal attack. \n\nConsidering all factors, the user might not be in the wrong because they were responding to ongoing issues and providing a truthful perspective. However, the delivery could have been softer. The answer would be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
