It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a friend who has been going through a lot with five kids from different fathers and five divorces. The friend has been making some pretty hurtful comments to the author for two years, questioning why the author has managed to have a relationship and kids while the friend hasn't. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as the reason she's having trouble finding someone. The friend gets upset and ends the conversation, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. The friend's comments were insults, attacking the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author has been trying to brush them off, which is understandable because no one likes to be insulted. But after a while, the author decides to confront the issue by pointing out the friend's situation. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The author's statement was factual\u2014she did have five kids with different fathers, and that could be a barrier for someone looking for a partner. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh. The mutual friends are saying the author is being unkind and that she has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled, which suggests that the friends perceive the author's comment as an insult rather than a constructive response.\n\nThe author's motivation was to stop the friend's insults, but by pointing out the friend's own issues, the author might have crossed a line. Even if the statement was true, it's possible that it came across as judgmental. The friend was already in a vulnerable spot, and the author's response could be seen as attacking her insecurities instead of empathizing. \n\nAlso, the author mentions working hard for her achievements, but the mutual friends believe the author is not understanding the friend's situation. It's possible that the author didn't consider the friend's feelings or the reasons behind her behavior. Maybe the friend is struggling with self-esteem and using her situation as a way to deflect from her own issues. The author's direct approach might have been too blunt and not supportive.\n\nAnother angle is that the friend's insults were hurtful and the author was just trying to defend herself. The author had been brushing off the insults for two years, which is a long time, and finally spoke up. But the method of confrontation might not have been the best. Instead of pointing out the friend's flaws, perhaps a more empathetic response could have been better, like acknowledging the friend's difficulties and offering support instead of a direct criticism.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends are supposed to be supportive. If the author's comment made the friend feel judged or attacked, then the author might be in the wrong. Even if the comment was true, it's about how it's delivered and the intent. The author's intent was to stop the insults, but perhaps the approach could have been different.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because the response was a direct attack on the friend's personal situation, which could be seen as unkind and unsupportive, even if it was a truthful response to the insults. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the community perceives the author's actions as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
