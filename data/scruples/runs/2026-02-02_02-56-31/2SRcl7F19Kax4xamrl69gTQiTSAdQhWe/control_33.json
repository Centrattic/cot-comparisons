It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling their friend she's still single because she has five kids by different fathers. The friend was making a lot of hurtful comments over two years, and the author finally snapped by pointing out her friend's situation as a reason for her relationship struggles. The mutual friends are now saying the author is wrong, using terms like \"skinny privilege\" and \"entitled,\" while the author feels they were just being honest and defending themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both perspectives. The friend's comments were clearly mean and untrue. She was making fun of the author's weight, job, and dating life, which is hurtful. However, when the author finally responded by pointing out her friend's history of multiple children with different fathers, it led to a fallout. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's response was a justified defense against the friend's insults or if it crossed a line. The friend's situation involves multiple divorces and child support issues, which are sensitive topics. Even if the author felt wronged, pointing out the friend's personal history could be seen as attacking her instead of addressing the insults. The friend's actions (five kids with different fathers) might contribute to her relationship struggles, but it's not the only factor, and the author might not have the right to make that judgment. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was considered harsh or judgmental. The concept of \"skinny privilege\" implies that the author might have an advantage in social situations due to their weight, which the author denies. However, even if that's not the case, responding with a personal attack (even if true) can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author might have had better ways to handle the situation, like setting boundaries without attacking the friend's personal life. The friend's behavior was toxic, but the author's response could have been more constructive. \n\nIn summary, while the friend was being rude, the author's response was a personal attack that might have been unkind and not helpful. The author could have addressed the insults without bringing up the friend's sensitive issues. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
