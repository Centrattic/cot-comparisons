It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the scenario is that the author's friend has gone through five marriages and is now single, with five kids from different fathers. The friend has been making some pretty insulting comments to the author over two years, and finally the author responds by pointing out that her multiple kids with different dads might be making it hard for someone to commit. The friend gets angry and ends the conversation, and now mutual friends are saying the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the two friends. The author mentions that the friend has been insulting them for two years, making comments about their weight, their job in the adult industry, and their dating life. The author has been brushing off these insults with polite responses. Then, when the friend asks again, the author responds with the truth about the friend's situation, which seems honest but perhaps harsh.\n\nNow, the key points to analyze: Is the author's response justified given the prior insults? The author's reply was factual\u2014pointing out the reality of having five kids with different fathers and no child support. But the way it's delivered might be seen as judgmental or insensitive. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic, but the author's response could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it was meant to hurt back or if it's not the author's place to make that comment.\n\nThe mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, saying the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled. The author feels they are not privileged and have worked hard. But the friends' reaction might indicate that the author's response was not well-received, possibly because it's a sensitive topic. Even if the author's intention was to help, making a blunt comment about someone's personal life and choices, especially regarding family and relationships, can be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's friend has been making untrue and low-quality insults, which the author had to endure. But when the author finally responds with a truthful but potentially harsh statement, it's seen as the problem. The question is whether the author was justified in their response. \n\nIn terms of friendship, friends are supposed to support each other. If the author had been the one making hurtful comments, but in this case, the friend was the one initiating the insults. However, the author's reply might have been a reaction to being insulted, but it's important to consider the context and the potential impact. The author's response might have been a necessary boundary, but the way it was delivered could have been more compassionate. \n\nThere might be a better way to approach the situation, like expressing concern without blaming or pointing out the issue in a more supportive manner. However, the author's statement was a direct cause for the fallout. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because the response, while honest, was delivered in a way that was hurtful and may not have been constructive. Friends should give each other space to make decisions without judgment, unless there's harm involved. The author's statement, while pointing out a possible reason for the friend's difficulties, could be seen as invalidating her experiences or making a judgment that's hard to undo.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's response might have been a justified reaction to ongoing insults, but the way it was delivered contributed to the conflict. However, in terms of friendship and communication, it's possible that the author overstepped, even if the comment was true. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because the friend was being insulting too. But in the context of the situation, the author's response might still be seen as inappropriate despite the provocation.\n"
