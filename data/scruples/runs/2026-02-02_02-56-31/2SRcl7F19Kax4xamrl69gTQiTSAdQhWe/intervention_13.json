It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids from different fathers is why she can't find someone. The friend had been making hurtful comments towards the user for two years, and the user finally snapped.\n\nFirst, the friend's comments were clearly personal and insulting, bringing up the user's weight, job, and relationships in a derogatory way. The user tried to brush them off, giving advice like focusing on themselves, but the friend kept pushing. When the user finally responded with the truth about her children, it led to a fallout.\n\nNow, the user is being criticized by mutual friends for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The user feels they were just being honest and that their hard work isn't being acknowledged. They also mention their own stable situation with one partner and an MBA, while the friend seems to be struggling with multiple relationships and no child support.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the insults, the user's intent to be truthful, and the resulting backlash. While the user's comment about the five kids might be true, the delivery and the fact that it's a very personal topic could have been hurtful. However, considering the friend's history of insults, the user might feel it was a justified response to put an end to the negativity. \n\nOn the other hand, even if the friend was starting the conflict, the user's response might have been the last straw. Friends should ideally support each other, so calling someone out for their personal choices, especially in a sensitive area like family, can be seen as crossing a line. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the user's comment was perceived as judgmental or hurtful, regardless of the context.\n\nBut the user was defending themselves against ongoing attacks. They might not be entirely in the wrong, but the way they expressed their truth could have been handled more carefully. Maybe a better approach would have been to set boundaries without attacking the friend's personal situation, leading to a different outcome. So, while the user's intent was self-defense against insults, the method might have been problematic. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because even in response to insults, the user's comment might have been too harsh and contributed to the breakdown of the friendship.\n"
