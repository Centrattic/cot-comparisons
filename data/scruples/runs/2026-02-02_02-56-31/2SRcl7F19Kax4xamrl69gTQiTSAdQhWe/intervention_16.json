It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers and none of the dads pay child support. The friend got really upset and hung up. Now mutual friends are saying the user has privilege and is a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's friend has been making personal, insulting comments about her friend for two years. The user tried to brush them off but finally responded with the truth about their friend's situation. The user's intention was to point out a possible reason why the friend might be having trouble finding a partner. However, the friend took it as an attack and the mutual friends are siding against the user.\n\nOn one hand, the user was defending themselves after enduring insults, so maybe they felt justified. But did they cross a line? The user's statement about the five kids and child support is factual, but it's also a sensitive topic. Even if true, bringing it up in a conversation about dating and singledom could be seen as hurtful or judgmental. People might find it harsh to attribute someone's relationship issues directly to their history, even if there's some truth to it.\n\nAlso, the user's friend has made comments that are untrue, like about the user being skinny when they're not. The user was responding to years of insults, so maybe their response was a release of built-up frustration. However, the way they framed it could have been more empathetic. Instead of directly blaming the friend's situation, maybe they could have expressed concern or offered support.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that they feel the user was unkind. The user might be accused of having a privileged perspective, even if their own life has challenges. But the user argues they've worked hard and aren't privileged. This part is tricky because the validity of their feelings versus the impact of their words matters.\n\nIn terms of what's right or wrong, the key is whether the user's response was constructive or just another insult. While the truth might be true, the delivery and context matter. The user might not be in the wrong for speaking the truth, but maybe there was a better way to approach it. However, considering the friend's history of insults, the user might have a valid reason to push back. Still, the mutual friends' perspective isn't completely invalid either because pointing out someone's life choices in a direct way can be hurtful, even if true.\n\nSo, the answer might be a mix. But according to the options, it's either A or B. Since the user was responding to two years of insults and tried to address the root cause, but the way they did it upset the friend and others, it's possible the user is in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively. Alternatively, they might not be wrong for standing up for themselves. It's a tough call. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) dynamic often hinges on whether the action was cruel or inconsiderate. Here, the user's response was factual but delivered in a way that's likely to hurt, even if intended as truthful. So maybe A is the answer because even if true, the delivery and context make it a problem.\n"
