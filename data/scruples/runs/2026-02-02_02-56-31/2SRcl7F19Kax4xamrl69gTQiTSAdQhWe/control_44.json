It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids by different fathers. \n\nFirst, the friend has been making hurtful comments about the author's body, job, and dating life for two years. The author tried to brush off the insults and respond with generic advice. Finally, when the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulty in dating.\n\nNow, the friends are siding with the ex-friend, saying the author is privileged and in the wrong. The author feels they were just being honest and defending themselves from ongoing insults.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the context of the insults and the appropriateness of the response. The author was responding to years of being belittled. The friend's comments were personal and perhaps envious. The author's response was direct but based on a factual issue\u2014having multiple children with different fathers might complicate finding a partner. But was it okay to point that out?\n\nOn one hand, the author had a right to set a boundary after being insulted. The response was honest but might have been harsh. The friend's behavior was toxic, so the author's frustration is valid. However, the way the author delivered the message could be seen as attacking the friend's personal situation, which might not be fair. It's possible that the author's response crossed a line, even if the friend was being difficult.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that they feel the author was unkind. But maybe they didn't see the full context of the two-year pattern of insults. The author might have a point that they were only being honest after being attacked. \n\nHowever, even in the face of insults, the way to respond matters. The author chose to address the root cause, but perhaps could have done so without being so direct and judgmental. Maybe a more empathetic approach would have been better, like acknowledging the friend's struggles while gently pointing out possible factors.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for the way they responded, even if the friend started it. Confronting someone with a direct and potentially hurtful truth, especially in the heat of the moment, can be seen as unkind. The author's actions might have been justified in self-defense, but the method could have been more compassionate. So the answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
