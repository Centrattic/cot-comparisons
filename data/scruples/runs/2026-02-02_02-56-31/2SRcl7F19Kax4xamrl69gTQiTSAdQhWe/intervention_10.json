It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is making it hard to find a partner. The friend was being insulting and the user finally snapped.\n\nFirst, the user's friend has a history of multiple marriages and children, which could be sensitive. The user's response was direct and pointed out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her dating struggles. The friend took it as an insult and ended the conversation.\n\nThe user has two kids with one father and works in the adult industry, which might be a point of contention since the friend also tried that. The user's job is a sensitive topic here. The friend's insults were personal and maybe low-quality, but the user's response was factual yet harsh. \n\nThe user's friends now say the user has \"skinny privilege\" and is being a bad friend. The user feels they're being misunderstood. They worked hard for their success, but maybe didn't consider the friend's feelings. \n\nIs it right to call out someone's behavior when they're being mean? Maybe, but the way it was done might have been hurtful. The user was honest, but honesty isn't always the best approach if it's delivered without empathy. The friend's actions might have been provocative, but the user could have addressed it differently. \n\nThe user might not be in the wrong for speaking their mind after being insulted, but they could have handled it more compassionately. The answer might be a bit nuanced, but since the user was defending their perspective after two years of insults, maybe they're not entirely wrong. However, pointing out someone's life choices in a way that's critical could come off as judgmental. So, maybe it's a B (not in the wrong), but with the advice to be more empathetic in the future.\n"
