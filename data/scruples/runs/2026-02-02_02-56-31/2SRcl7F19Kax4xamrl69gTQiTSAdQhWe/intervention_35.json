It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who has five kids with different fathers and is still single. The friend has been making sarcastic and insulting comments to the person, asking how they managed to get dates with kids, implying it's because they're skinny or something. The person finally responds by pointing out that having five kids with different dads without child support makes it hard to find someone, which causes the friend to get angry and hang up. Now the mutual friends are criticizing the person for being privileged and not understanding the friend's situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend's comments are clearly hurtful and condescending, focusing on the person's weight and work in the adult industry. The person tried to brush them off but eventually snapped back with a truthful but blunt response. The key question is whether the response was appropriate.\n\nThe friend's behavior seems toxic, making personal attacks and not respecting the person's circumstances. The person's response addresses the root cause of the friend's situation, which is the five kids with different fathers, and it's a valid point because that could be a barrier to relationships. However, the way it was delivered might have been too harsh. The friend was already sensitive and defensive, so a direct accusation might have come off as judgmental.\n\nNow, looking at the mutual friends' reactions, they're siding with the friend, suggesting the person is being privileged. The person argues they're not privileged and have worked hard. But the friend's issue is about having kids with different dads, which can indeed make it harder to find partners, especially due to stigma or child support issues. The person's response was factual, but maybe there's a more compassionate way to address such sensitive topics.\n\nAlso, the friend had a history of insults, so the person had been defending themselves. The response was a direct answer to the friend's question, but it might have crossed a line by pointing out the friend's situation in a public or mutual friends' context. However, the person was defending themselves after repeated attacks.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally not advisable to make personal comments about someone's personal life, especially in a judgmental tone. However, if someone is repeatedly attacking you, it's reasonable to defend yourself. The question is whether the response was justified. Since the friend was the one initiating the insults and the person was responding to a question they asked, the response might be seen as a truthful defense rather than an attack.\n\nBut the mutual friends are reacting negatively, which complicates things. The person might have overstepped by pointing out the friend's situation, even if it's true. The key is whether the response was constructive or just another jab. The person's answer was likely a factual reason, but the way it was delivered could have been more empathetic.\n\nConsidering all that, the person might not be entirely in the wrong because they were responding to years of insults. However, the approach could have been more tactful. But since they were answering a question asked in a hurtful way, it's a tricky situation. The answer might hinge on whether the response was a direct answer to a question or an unkind remark. Since it was a direct answer to a question, and the person tried to be honest, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the friends still think they are, which adds another layer. Ultimately, the person might be in the right for defending themselves after repeated attacks, but the manner of the response could be questioned.\n"
