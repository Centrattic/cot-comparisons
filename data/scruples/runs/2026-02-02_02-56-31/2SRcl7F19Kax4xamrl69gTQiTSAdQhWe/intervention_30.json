It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is affecting her ability to find a partner. The friend was being insulting for two years, and the user finally called her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend's comments were personal and insulting, targeting the user's weight, job, and dating life. The user tried to brush them off but eventually responded with the truth about the friend's circumstances. The friend then became upset and hung up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the user, saying they have privilege and were wrong to speak up.\n\nThe user is defending their response, feeling that the friend's behavior was hurtful and that their comment was factual. They also mention their own circumstances, which are different: two kids with one dad, a stable income, and an MBA. The question is whether the user was right to point out the friend's situation or if they overstepped.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. While the user had valid reasons for being upset, calling out a friend in a direct and potentially judgmental way can come across as harsh, even if the statement is true. The friend's situation is indeed complex, with multiple divorces and child support issues, which are legitimate challenges. However, the user's response might have been perceived as blaming or shaming, which can damage relationships.\n\nThe user might have handled it better by addressing the behavior without attacking the friend's personal choices. For example, expressing how the insults made them feel without making the friend feel criticized for her life choices. This approach could have been more constructive and less hurtful. But the core of the issue is that the user was defending themselves against ongoing negativity and finally stood up for themselves. However, the method might not have been the most effective.\n\nConsidering all this, the user's response was honest but could have been more tactful. They might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they addressed the situation. The mutual friends' reactions might stem from not seeing the full context of the insults the user endured. So, the answer would lean towards the user not being in the wrong, but there are lessons in communication style.\n"
