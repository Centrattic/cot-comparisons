It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is why she's having trouble getting dates. The friend was already giving them insults about their weight, job, and dating life for two years. The user finally snapped and told the truth, leading to the friend cutting off contact. Now mutual friends are criticizing the user for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior was ongoing and insulting. The user tried to brush it off, but the insults continued. When the user finally addressed the real issue, they might have been honest but maybe crossed a line. However, the friend was the one who kept bringing up topics and making the user feel attacked. \n\nThe user's response was factual\u2014pointing out the five kids with different dads as a possible reason. But is it okay to call someone out for their own issues, even if it's true? Could there be a better way to express that concern without being blunt? Maybe the user's intention was to help, but the delivery was harsh. Also, the mutual friends are taking sides, which complicates things. \n\nThe user works hard and has a stable situation, but the friend's situation is different. However, the user was defending themselves after being insulted. The line between calling someone out and being rude can be thin. The user might not be entirely wrong since they were responding to two years of insults. But maybe there was a more tactful way to address it. \n\nI need to decide if the user's response was justified. On one hand, they were defending themselves and pointing out a valid point. On the other, it might have been too direct, especially after the friend's insults. The answer might depend on cultural norms or social expectations. In some contexts, honesty is appreciated, but if it's delivered in a way that's hurtful without considering the other person's feelings, it could be seen as the wrong move. \n\nBut considering the friend's behavior, the user might have been within their rights to respond honestly after being targeted for so long. The mutual friends' reactions might be missing the point about the ongoing harassment. So, the user might not be in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Could there be a middle ground where they expressed concern without making it an accusation? Maybe. However, the user's response was a direct answer to the friend's question, so it's a valid truth. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The user was responding to two years of insults and honestly answering a repeated question with a valid point. While the delivery could have been softer, the content itself wasn't untrue. The friend's own actions contributed to the conflict. The user's job and situation aren't the issue here. The main issue is the friend's behavior and how the user addressed it after enduring it for so long.\n"
