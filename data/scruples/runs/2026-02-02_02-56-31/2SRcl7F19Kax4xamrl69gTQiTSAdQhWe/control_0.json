It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single with five kids by different fathers is the reason she's struggling to find a partner. The friend had been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author, and the author finally snapped. The friends and mutual friends are now saying the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that their friend has been making personal and insulting remarks for two years. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses. The final trigger was the friend's persistent and hurtful questions about why the author is successful in dating with kids, while the friend isn't. The author's response was pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason.\n\nNow, the key points here are the validity of the author's comment and whether it was an appropriate response. The author's statement about the friend having five kids with different dads and no child support could be seen as a factual observation. However, the way it's framed might come off as judgmental. The author is pointing out a potential barrier the friend might have in finding a partner, which could be true, but it's a sensitive topic. Relationships are complex, and there are many factors involved in dating struggles. The author's comment might have been a direct response to the friend's insults, but it's possible that even if true, it's not the kind of thing that should be said in a friendship, especially after a buildup of tension.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author feels they're not privileged and have worked hard. However, the friends might be reacting to the author's comment as a judgmental statement that oversimplifies the friend's issues. The author's work in the adult industry is another sensitive point, and the friend had also tried that, so there's a history of tension around that topic.\n\nThe friend's behavior is clearly problematic with the insults, but the author's response might have crossed a line. Even if the comment was true, directly pointing out someone's personal life in a critical manner in the heat of the moment can be hurtful. The author might have intended to be honest, but the delivery and context matter. The friend was already in a vulnerable position, and the author's comment could have been seen as adding insult to injury.\n\nIn terms of friendship dynamics, the author might have felt attacked and wanted to defend themselves, but the response was a direct hit to the friend's personal life. There could have been a better way to address the insults without attacking the friend's situation. Maybe setting boundaries or expressing how the insults hurt them instead of retaliating with their own critique.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might not be entirely wrong for responding as they did, given the two years of insults. However, the appropriateness of the response is questionable. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the response was justified. The friend's behavior was inexcusable, but the author's direct and judgmental reply might have exacerbated the situation. Therefore, while the author had reasons for their reaction, the way they handled it might indeed be seen as in the wrong. However, some might argue that the friend's behavior was worse. The mutual friends' reactions also suggest that the author's comment was inappropriate. Ultimately, even if true, the author's response could be considered crossing a line in the friendship.\n"
