It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote about their situation) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers and no child support. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been asking the author questions that the author feels are insulting. Examples include commenting on her weight, implying she's only dating because she's skinny, and making fun of her job. The author has been brushing off these comments but then finally tells her friend that her situation with the kids is making it hard for her to find someone.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intent was to be honest and point out what they see as the real issue, but it came off as harsh. The friend was already making hurtful comments, so the author was defending themselves. The mutual friends are now siding with the friend, saying the author was privileged and wrong to say that.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to say that. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation.\n\nI should consider if the author's response was a justified defense against insults or if it was crossing a line. The author's friend was being rude and making personal attacks, so maybe the author was just responding in kind. However, pointing out someone's personal issues, even if true, can be seen as attacking and not helpful. The author's statement might have been a factual observation, but the delivery could have been hurtful. Also, the author's own job in the adult industry might be a sensitive topic, so bringing up the friend's situation could be seen as retaliating.\n\nBut the author was tired of being insulted and finally stood up for themselves. The problem is that the response might have been too direct, leading to a fallout. Friends are saying the author is privileged and a bad friend, but the author feels like they're being misunderstood and aren't entitled.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were responding to ongoing insults. However, the way they responded might not have been the best approach. But the question is specifically about whether they're in the wrong. The author's response was honest but could be seen as attacking the friend's personal choices, which might not be the right approach even if the friend was being rude. So there's a balance here between defending oneself and being confrontational.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they were responding to a friend who was being insulting and they were trying to give an honest answer. However, the mutual friends might not see it that way. But based on the situation described, the author had a right to be honest, even if it was harsh.\n"
