It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they told their friend she's still single because she has five kids with different fathers, and the friend got really upset. The friend had been making a bunch of comments over two years, which the user brushed off. Then finally, when the friend asked again, the user made a direct comment about the five kids and the lack of child support. Now, mutual friends are saying the user is in the wrong, and the user is feeling defensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's friend was making repeated comments that the user found insulting. These comments were about the user's weight, their job, and their dating life. The user tried to deflect for two years but finally responded with a direct critique of the friend's situation. The user's reasoning was that having five kids with different fathers and no child support makes it hard to find someone. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user was wrong to say that. Let's break it down. The user's friend was being critical and making hurtful remarks, but when the user responded with their own critique, it backfired. The mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, suggesting the user was being privileged and unkind. \n\nI should consider intent and impact. The user's intent was to stop the insults, but the impact was damaging to the friendship. Even if the friend was wrong, confronting someone in a direct and judgmental way during a conversation might not be the best approach. Also, the user's comment about the friend's children and child support is a personal matter that might be sensitive. \n\nAnother angle: the user's friend had a history of making hurtful comments, but the user's response might have crossed a line by making a personal accusation. Even if the underlying issue is valid, the way it was delivered could be seen as shaming. The user might have thought they were being honest, but honesty can be delivered in a way that's more constructive. \n\nAlso, the user mentions that mutual friends are now criticizing them for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The user feels this is unfair because they've worked hard. However, the friends might feel that the user's response was a personal attack rather than a supportive conversation. \n\nPossible better approaches: The user could have addressed the friend's behavior first, perhaps setting boundaries about the insults instead of responding in kind. Maybe saying something like, \"I don't like how you're talking to me. Maybe we should talk about your feelings instead of making me the target.\" Alternatively, the user could have avoided giving a direct answer and instead redirected the conversation to focus on the friend's own issues without making a judgment.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The user was defending themselves against ongoing insults, but their response might have been too harsh. The friend's behavior was poor, but the user's reaction also contributed to the breakdown of the friendship. \n\nThe key here is whether the user's response was a justified defense of themselves or an unkind attack. Since the user's comment directly addressed the friend's situation in a way that could be seen as shaming, it's possible that the user is at least partially in the wrong. However, the initial context of the friend's behavior complicates things. \n\nBut given that the user's response was a direct accusation about the friend's personal life, which is a sensitive topic, it's likely that the user overstepped. Even if the friend was wrong, the user's method of confronting them was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong). However, there's a balance here. The user was responding to two years of insults, so their frustration is understandable. But the way they expressed it might have been the main issue. So, perhaps they're in the wrong for the method, even if the intent was to stop the insults. So, A.\n"
