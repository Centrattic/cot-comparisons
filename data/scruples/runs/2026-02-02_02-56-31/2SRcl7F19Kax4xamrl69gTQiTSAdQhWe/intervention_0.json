It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who's been through five marriages and has kids with different fathers, and she keeps making insulting comments to the narrator about their dating life and work. The narrator finally snaps and tells her that her situation with the kids is making it hard for her to find someone. The mutual friends are now saying the narrator is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of multiple marriages and children with different fathers, which might be a sensitive topic. The narrator's friend has been making personal attacks over two years, which the narrator tried to brush off. When the narrator finally responds with the truth about her friend's situation, it causes a fallout.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's behavior (insulting remarks), the narrator's response (calling out the friend's situation), and the reaction from mutual friends. The question is whether the narrator was wrong to respond the way they did.\n\nThe friend's insults were personal and perhaps untrue, like comments about the narrator's weight and dating life. The narrator tried to deflect them, but eventually, when confronted again, gave an honest answer that pointed out the friend's situation. The friend took it as an insult and hung up.\n\nNow, considering if the narrator is in the wrong. If the friend was making false accusations and the narrator corrected her with a truthful statement, that might be justified. However, the way it was delivered could matter. If the narrator was blunt or harsh, even if the statement was true, it might have come off as insensitive or hurtful. Also, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that they felt the narrator was being critical in a way that's not helpful, maybe even condescending.\n\nAnother angle is whether the narrator should have addressed the behavior earlier or found a different way to respond without making it about the friend's situation. The narrator's statement was honest, but maybe it was not delivered with empathy. The friend might have felt attacked, especially since the narrator pointed out her difficulties as the reason for her being single. The friend could interpret this as blaming her for her own problems, which might be a sensitive topic.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends mentioned that the narrator has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled. The narrator argues that they work hard and aren't actually privileged. This could indicate that the friends feel the narrator is not understanding the friend's challenges, thus the comment was out of place.\n\nIn summary, the narrator's response was a truthful assessment but might have been delivered in a way that was perceived as judgmental. The friend's behavior was clearly problematic, but the narrator's response may have crossed a line by directly pointing out the friend's issues in a conversation where the friend was already being defensive or confrontational. It's possible that a more empathetic approach could have been better, but the question is whether the narrator was in the wrong. Since the narrator was responding to ongoing insults and provided an honest, if blunt, reply, it's a bit of a gray area. However, considering the friend's emotional state and the potential for the response to feel like an attack, the narrator might be seen as having overstepped, even if the statement was true. So, leaning towards A (they are in the wrong) because the delivery might have been hurtful despite the truth.\n"
