It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers was making it hard to find someone. The friend was being insulting for two years, and the user finally responded honestly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was constantly making negative and insulting comments about the user's dating life and job. The user tried to brush them off but eventually snapped. The user's response was about the friend's situation, which could be a valid point because having multiple partners might affect someone's dating prospects. However, the way it was said might have been hurtful.\n\nNow, the user's defense is that they were tired of being insulted and that they were stating the truth. The mutual friends are taking the friend's side, saying the user is privileged and a bad friend. The user feels they're not entitled and have worked hard. \n\nI need to check if the user's response was justified. While the friend was insincere, was the user's reply the best approach? The user could have addressed the insults without bringing up the friend's personal situation in a critical way. Maybe a more empathetic approach would have been better, focusing on the friend's feelings rather than pointing out her flaws. \n\nAlso, even if the user's statement is factually correct, the manner in which it was delivered\u2014during a conversation filled with insults\u2014might have been the issue. It could come off as cruel, especially if the friend was already vulnerable. The user might have thought they were being honest but didn't consider the emotional impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the user was defending themselves after repeated insults. It's possible they felt they had to set a boundary. However, the response might not have been the most constructive. Perhaps a better approach would have been to express their feelings about the insults and suggest seeking support elsewhere without attacking the friend's situation.\n\nConsidering all angles, the user's intention was to be honest, but the execution might have been hurtful. So, maybe they are in the wrong for how they delivered the message, even if the content had some truth to it. The key is whether the response was necessary and kind. Since the user was defending against insults but could have responded differently, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong).\n"
