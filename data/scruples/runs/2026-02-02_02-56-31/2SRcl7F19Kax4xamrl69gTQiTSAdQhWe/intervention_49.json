It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend that her five kids with different fathers might be why she can't find a partner. The friend was making insults about the user's weight, job, and dating life, and the user finally snapped in response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior was pretty hurtful and insincere, with the user trying to brush it off for two years. The user's response points out a factual situation\u2014five kids with different fathers\u2014but maybe the way they said it was harsh. The key here is whether the response was justified as a counter to the insults or if it crossed the line.\n\nThe user's friend has a valid issue with the user's line of work, but that doesn't make the insults okay. The user's response addresses a real factor in the friend's situation, but delivering it in a judgmental way might have been unkind. Friends should support each other, but the friend was being toxic. However, the user's approach might have been too direct and hurtful, even if truthful.\n\nAlso, the user's friends are labeling them as privileged, which adds another layer. Maybe the user's response was seen as privileged because they're in a different situation. The user might not have considered the emotional impact of their words, even if the truth was valid. The question is whether the response was a fair retaliation or an overstep.\n\nIn terms of alternatives, the user could have addressed the insults without pointing out the friend's situation in a critical way. Perhaps focusing on the friend's behavior without making a judgment about her circumstances. But the user was defensive and tired of the insults, which is understandable. Balance is key here\u2014being honest but compassionate.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the user might be in the wrong because they chose to retaliate with a potentially hurtful truth instead of addressing the insults constructively. Even if the truth is valid, the delivery and context matter. The friend's actions were wrong, but the user's response might not have been the best approach. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (Yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
