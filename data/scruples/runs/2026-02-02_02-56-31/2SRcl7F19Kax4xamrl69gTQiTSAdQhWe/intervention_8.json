It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids by different fathers is why she's single. The friend was being insulting for two years, and the user finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of making comments that the user finds insulting. The user tried to brush them off with polite responses, but eventually, when the friend kept pushing, they gave a direct answer pointing out the friend's situation as a potential issue. The friend reacted negatively, and mutual friends are now criticizing the user for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nSo, the user's main question is whether their response was justified. On one hand, the user was defending themselves against ongoing insults. On the other, they made a comment that could be seen as judgmental or hurtful. \n\nI should consider if the user's response was a direct reaction to the friend's behavior. The user mentions that the friend's situation (five kids with different fathers and no child support) is a real issue that could deter potential partners. However, pointing that out in a conversation where the friend was asking for advice might come off as blaming the victim or being unsupportive. \n\nAlso, the user's job in the adult industry is mentioned. They have an MBA and a \"vanilla\" job, which might add context to how their life is perceived differently. The mutual friends are calling the user privileged, but the user feels they've worked hard. This could be a case of differing perspectives on privilege and success.\n\nThe key here is whether the user's response was an appropriate way to address the friend's comments. Even if the friend was being rude, the user's reply might have crossed a line by making a judgment about her personal choices. It's possible that the user was trying to be honest but didn't consider the emotional impact. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and impact. The user's intent was to tell the truth and stop the insults, but the impact was causing hurt and damaging the friendship. However, the friend's behavior was also problematic. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The user might not be entirely in the wrong for pointing out the truth, but their method of doing so might have been harsh. A better approach could have been to express concern without blaming, or to set boundaries without being judgmental. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but with the caveat that there's room for a more empathetic response. However, considering the mutual friends' reactions and the emotional impact, there's a strong argument that the user's response was unhelpful and harsh, making them at least partially the asshole. But since the question asks for A or B, and the user's intent was to be honest, maybe B is the choice here.\n"
