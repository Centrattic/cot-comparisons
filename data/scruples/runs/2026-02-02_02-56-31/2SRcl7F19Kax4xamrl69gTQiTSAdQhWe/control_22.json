It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend has five kids with different fathers and is single, and she's been making a lot of comments that the author finds insulting. The friend's comments are about the author's weight, dating life, and job. The author finally snaps and tells her that having five kids with different dads makes it hard to find someone. The friend gets angry and hangs up, and mutual friends are now saying the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making repeated, personal, and potentially hurtful comments. The author has been trying to brush them off with responses like \"focus on yourself,\" but maybe the friend was expecting advice or validation. The author's final response is a direct call-out of the friend's situation as a reason she's struggling to find a partner. \n\nI should think about the intent. The author says they were tired of being insulted and wanted to be honest. The friend's comments were low-quality and untrue, according to the author. The author's response was meant to point out a realistic challenge the friend might face, but in a way that might come off as judgmental.\n\nBut then, mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and that they're a bad friend. Maybe the author's comment, while true, was delivered without empathy. The friend has five kids with different fathers, which is a complex situation. The author mentions their own kids and the co-parenting arrangement. The author's job in the adult industry and having an MBA might add to the perception of privilege, but the author says they work hard.\n\nIs it the author's responsibility to not make a comment like that? The friend was being critical, but does that give the author the right to reciprocate? The author's statement could be seen as a personal attack, even if it's based on truth. Maybe a better approach would have been to address the insults without attacking the friend's personal choices.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions might indicate that the author's comment crossed a line. Even if the friend was difficult, the response was blunt and possibly hurtful. The author might not have considered that the friend's situation is sensitive and that the comment could be seen as shaming her for her choices, regardless of their validity.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author might be in the wrong because they responded with a direct, judgmental statement that, while possibly true, was delivered without tact and may have deepened the conflict. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's approach wasn't the best, and there might have been a more constructive way to handle the situation.\n"
