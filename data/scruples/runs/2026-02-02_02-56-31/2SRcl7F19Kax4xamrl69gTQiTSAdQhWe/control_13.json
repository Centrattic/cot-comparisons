It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author was in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The friend has been making comments that the author perceives as insults. The friend is asking about the author's dating life in a way that's cutting, maybe implying that the author's success in relationships is because of her appearance or work in the adult industry. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation with the kids and child support, which leads to the friend getting angry and cutting off.\n\nNow, the key points here are the nature of the insults and the author's response. The friend's comments seem to target the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author, after enduring this for two years, calls out the friend's situation as a reason she's single. The mutual friends are now criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nI should consider if the author's response was justified. The friend's questions were perhaps passive-aggressive, but the author's answer was a direct accusation about her marital status and child support issues. Even if the author felt attacked, calling out someone's personal life in a judgmental way, even if true, might be seen as crossing a line. Relationships and family matters are sensitive topics. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend tried to work in the same industry, so maybe there's some personal history there. However, the main issue is whether the author's truth was delivered in a way that was cruel or necessary. The friend might have felt shamed, leading to the fallout. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that they found the author's comment harsh, possibly because it's a sensitive topic. \n\nThe author might argue they were just being honest after being mocked, but in interpersonal relationships, how you convey the truth matters. The friend's behavior was hurtful, but the author's response might have been equally unkind. There's a balance between standing up for yourself and being considerate. The author could have addressed the insults without attacking the friend's personal circumstances. \n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's behavior was problematic, the author's choice of response might be seen as the wrong approach because it targeted a personal flaw of the friend. Even if the statement is true, delivering it in a confrontational manner without empathy could be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be partly in the wrong.\n"
