It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is affecting her chances of getting a partner. The friend was giving them a hard time about their dating life and making snide comments. The user finally snapped and called out the friend's situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's friend has a history of multiple divorces and children with different fathers, and she's been making passive-aggressive comments about the user's dating life. The user tried to brush off the insults for two years, then responded honestly when pushed. The friend went into a rage, and now the mutual friends are criticizing the user for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nThe user's defense is that they were being truthful. They have two kids with the same dad, work in the adult industry (though they mention a vanilla job and an MBA), and feel they've worked hard. They believe their friend was making baseless insults, so they called her out.\n\nNow, to evaluate if the user was in the wrong. The key points are: did the user have the right to point out the friend's situation, even if it's true? Was the response hurtful or necessary? The user's comments were about a sensitive topic\u2014family structure and child support\u2014which can be very personal and defensive. Even if true, pointing this out in the heat of the moment might not be the best approach, especially if the friend was already being antagonistic. \n\nThe user's intention was to be honest after enduring insults, but the way it was delivered could be seen as attacking the friend's personal life in front of others or in a conversation that was already tense. The friend's reaction was extreme, but that doesn't necessarily make the user right or wrong. It's a judgment call between defending oneself versus being overly critical.\n\nMutual friends' reactions suggest they think the user's privilege and entitlement played a role, even if the user feels they've worked hard. The user's job in the adult industry might be a sensitive topic, and the friend's comments about it could have added to the tension. However, the user's response was a direct correlation between the friend's situation and her dating struggles, which is a factual point but might come off as harsh.\n\nIn terms of social norms, calling out someone's personal life when they've been making passive-aggressive remarks could be seen as a justified self-defense, but it's also possible that there was a more tactful way to respond. The user's answer was direct, but maybe there's room to argue that it was necessary given the context. Alternatively, perhaps the user could have handled it differently without being so confrontational.\n\nConsidering all factors, the user was in a difficult situation where they were being harassed with insults. Their response was truthful but potentially hurtful. The answer hinges on whether truth justifies the delivery and the context. Since the user was defending themselves against a friend who was being cruel, the user might not be in the wrong. However, the method of confronting the issue could be questioned. But given the circumstances, the user's intention was to be honest after enduring two years of insults. So, it's a close call, but leaning towards the user not being in the wrong.\n"
