It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids by different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend has been divorced five times and is still single. The friend has been making hurtful comments about the author's dating life and work. The author, after a lot of time, finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation with the five kids and no child support as a reason she can't find someone. The friend got angry and hung up. Now, mutual friends are blaming the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the author's response was a justified defense against the friend's insults or if it was crossing a line. The friend's comments were about the author's appearance, job, and dating habits, which are personal and possibly mean. The author tried to brush them off but eventually snapped. \n\nThe author's reply was pointing out a factual aspect of the friend's situation that might affect her ability to find a partner. Is calling someone out on their situation considered wrong, even if it's harsh? On one hand, the author was defending themselves after being insulted. On the other hand, the friend's comment about child support and multiple fathers might be a sensitive topic. The author might have overstepped by bringing up something personal that's not the friend's fault entirely. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are saying the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled. The author argues that they worked hard. But the friends' reaction suggests they felt the comment was judgmental and not helpful. \n\nI think the question is whether the author's response was a fair retort or if it was an attack. While the friend was being rude, the author's response might have been too harsh or not the right way to handle it. There might have been a better, more constructive way to address the insults without bringing up the friend's personal situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they responded with a personal attack instead of addressing the insults without attacking the friend's circumstances. Even if the friend was being mean, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
