It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after telling their friend that her being single is because of having five kids with different fathers. The friend has been making a lot of comments that the author feels are insulting. The author's response was honest but maybe harsh. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend has been making comments about her friend's weight, job, and dating life for two years. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses. Then, when the friend keeps asking, the author finally responds with a truth about the five kids and no child support. The friend reacts badly, and mutual friends are now taking her side, saying the author is privileged and a bad friend.\n\nHmm. The key points here are whether the author had the right to address the friend's behavior and if the response was appropriate. The author's friend was making negative and personal remarks, which the author found hurtful. The author's response was pointing out a possible reason for the friend's situation, which is true but might be sensitive.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe they were defending themselves against ongoing insults. However, the way they responded could have been hurtful. The author's friend might not appreciate being told that her choices are the reason she's single, even if it's true. Also, mutual friends think the author is being privileged, maybe because they don't consider the author's own challenges, like having kids and working in a stigmatized job.\n\nBut the author had been trying to be nice before, and the friend kept pushing. Maybe the author's response was a justified defense. However, using the friend's personal choices as a reason might not be the best approach. It could come off as judgmental. The author might have been better off setting boundaries without attacking the friend's choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was toxic, and the author had a right to speak up. The mutual friends' reactions might be influenced by their own biases, not the actual situation. The author's response was a factual statement, even if it was blunt.\n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, the author had been patient, but on the other, the friend's behavior was disrespectful. The author's response, while honest, might have been too direct and hurtful. But considering the context of ongoing insults, maybe the author had a right to respond. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not entirely, but maybe there was a better way to handle it. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the answer is A for yes and B for no, I think B makes sense because the author was responding to years of insults, but maybe there's a better answer. Wait, but some might argue that even if the friend was mean, the author's response was inappropriate. But given the context, maybe B is correct.\n"
