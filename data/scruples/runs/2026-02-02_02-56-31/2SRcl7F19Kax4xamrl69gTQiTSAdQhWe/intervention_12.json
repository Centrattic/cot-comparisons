It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're at fault for telling their friend she's single because of having five kids with different dads. The friend was constantly making insulting comments about the user's weight, job, and dating life. The user finally snapped and called out the friend's situation, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had been making hurtful remarks for two years, and the user tried to brush them off with polite responses. The user's main point was pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her dating struggles. \n\nThe user's friend is in a tough spot with multiple children and no child support, which is definitely a challenging situation. However, the user's response was to directly address the friend's behavior, which might have been harsh but was a reaction to ongoing insults. \n\nThe mutual friends are criticizing the user for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, but the user feels they've worked hard and aren't privileged. The user's job in the adult industry might be a sensitive topic, and the friend's past attempts to do the same could complicate things.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's honesty might have been blunt, but they were responding to two years of insults. However, the way they delivered the truth could have been more empathetic. The user might not be entirely at fault because they were defending themselves against constant negativity, but they could have handled it differently to avoid escalating the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was problematic, constantly belittling the user. The user had a right to set boundaries, but maybe the approach was too direct. The key is whether the user's response was justified given the friend's actions. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a gray area. The user's intention was to be truthful, but the method might have been poor. However, the friend's behavior was also hurtful. So, maybe the user isn't in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. The answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the user was responding to ongoing insults and was honest about their perspective, even if it was delivered poorly.\n"
