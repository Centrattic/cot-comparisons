It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. The friend was making a bunch of insults, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend was making personal and hurtful comments about the author's weight, dating life, job, etc. The author tried to brush them off but eventually responded with the truth about the friend's situation. Now, mutual friends are saying the author is wrong, accusing them of having privilege and not understanding the friend's struggles.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the insults, the author's motivation, and the appropriateness of their response. The friend's comments were clearly intended to be hurtful, even if they were not factually accurate (like the author not being skinny). The author was defending themselves by pointing out the friend's behavior as a reason for her situation. However, the response might have come off as judgmental and could have been hurtful, even if it was a truthful observation.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, while the friend was being mean, the author's response might have been too direct and could have been more empathetic. Telling someone that their personal situation is causing their problems can be seen as attacking their character, even if it's true. The mutual friends' reactions suggest they felt the author's response was harsh and not supportive, despite the provocation.\n\nIt's important to consider intent and impact. The author's intent was to stop the insults and give a truthful answer, but the impact was damaging the friendship. The question is whether the truth justifies the method of delivery. Also, the author's own work in the adult industry and their other challenges might be relevant in terms of their perspective, but that's not necessarily the main issue here.\n\nSo, while the author had a valid reason to be defensive, the way they responded may have been inappropriate. The friend's behavior was wrong, but the author could have handled it differently. The key is whether the author crossed a line by making a personal judgment. Since the mutual friends are siding with the friend, it might indicate that the author's response was not well-received and is considered in the wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), because even though the friend was being rude, the author's response was a direct personal attack, which is not the right way to handle it, even if the comment was true.\n"
