It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their friend that she's still single because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making a lot of insulting comments over two years, and the author finally snapped by pointing out the issue with the kids and child support. Now the mutual friends are blaming the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the friend has been making a lot of negative and insulting remarks for two years, which the author has been brushing off. The friend's comments were not just questions but also included insults about the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author's response was to point out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulties in finding a partner. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior. She's been consistently making insults, and the author's response was in response to being attacked. The author's statement is a factual observation about a potential barrier to finding a partner. However, the friend's reaction was to get angry and hang up, and mutual friends are now siding with her, suggesting the author overstepped.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The friend's behavior was hurtful and rude, but when the author responded with a truthful but potentially hurtful statement, they crossed a line? The problem is that the author addressed the root issue the friend was facing, which is a sensitive topic. Even if the friend was being insulting, calling out someone's personal issues can be seen as attacking them, even if it's true. The author might have been trying to be honest, but the way it was delivered could be seen as shaming or judgmental.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reaction is that the author is privileged and entitled. The author argues that they are not, but the perception is that the author's response was dismissive of the friend's struggles. The friend's situation with multiple children and single parenthood is complex and not easy, but the author's comment might have come across as blaming her for her circumstances. \n\nIs there a better way to respond? Maybe the author could have addressed the friend's behavior without attacking her personal situation. For example, expressing how the insults make the author feel instead of making a judgment about the friend's dating life. However, the friend was clearly being insulting, so the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the author's response was a direct, honest answer to a question, but the timing and context might have made it inappropriate. The friend's behavior was bad, but the author's response might have been the final straw. The mutual friends see the author as the one who caused the issue, which is a common dynamic when someone calls out another's problematic behavior.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's insults were wrong, the author's response might have been a justified reaction to ongoing negativity, but delivering the truth in a blunt manner could be seen as unkind. However, the friend's issues with having multiple children are her own, and the author's statement was factual. The mutual friends are reacting to the author's comment as if it's an attack, but the author was responding to the friend's own attacks. It's a bit of a gray area, but perhaps the author's response was in the wrong because it was a direct attack on the friend's personal situation, which is sensitive and not the same as the friend's insults. Alternatively, the author might not be in the wrong because they were responding to being attacked with honesty.\n"
