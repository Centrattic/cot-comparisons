It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they did the right thing by telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is why she's having trouble finding a partner. The friend was making a lot of insulting remarks, and the user finally snapped. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the user, saying they have privilege and were out of line.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend kept making personal, hurtful comments that were both untrue and cutting. The user tried to brush them off but eventually responded with a direct statement about the friend's situation. The friend reacted negatively. The user is now being told they're in the wrong by mutual friends, which is causing conflict.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's behavior was hostile and insulting, the user's response was a factual statement (though maybe harsh), and the friends are now taking sides. The user feels they were defending themselves after being targeted for two years. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, while the friend's comments were hurtful, the user's response might have been a low blow. Telling someone that their personal situation (multiple children with different fathers) is the reason they can't date could be seen as invalidating their experiences. Even if it's true, it's a sensitive topic and might come off as judgmental. The user's friends might feel that the response was unfair, especially if they believe the friend's problems are being dismissed. \n\nHowever, the user was defending themselves against ongoing insults. It's possible that the user felt cornered and finally spoke up. But the way they phrased it might have been too harsh, even if it was a valid point. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the user's approach wasn't well-received, possibly because it's a delicate topic and not the best way to address the friend's issues.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the user might have been justified in wanting to end the insults but chose a method that backfired. The answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because the response could be seen as unkind and not the best way to handle the situation, even if the friend was being difficult.\n"
