It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend of the author who has five children by different fathers and is currently single. The friend has been making comments that the author feels are insulting, especially regarding her single status and the author's own dating life. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as the reason she can't find someone. The friend is upset, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author for being privileged and not understanding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend's comments are clearly personal attacks, and the author has been trying to brush them off. The final response from the author was honest but direct, possibly hurtful. The friend's reaction was to get angry and hang up. The mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, suggesting the author is privileged.\n\nThe key points are: the author was defending themselves from insults, but their response may have been perceived as judgmental or rude. Even though the friend is in a problematic situation, calling out her circumstances might have crossed a line. The author's intention was to stop the insults, but the method might have been unkind.\n\nAlso, the author's work in the adult industry might be sensitive, and the friend's past attempts to enter the same field could add to the tension. The author might have felt justified due to the ongoing harassment, but the response could have been more empathetic. The mutual friends' reactions indicate that the author's statement was hurtful, even if they were telling the truth.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer might depend on whether the response was a necessary truth or an unkind attack. Even if the friend was at fault for the insults, the author's response might have been too harsh. There could have been a better way to set boundaries without being so direct. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (Answer A) because their response was hurtful, even if they were protecting themselves from abuse.\n"
