It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers and no child support. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making mean comments about the author for two years, like implying the author's success is due to being skinny or being a blonde. The author has been brushing off these insults, giving vague advice. Finally, when the friend asks again, the author responds by pointing out the friend's situation with multiple kids and no support. The friend gets angry, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was right to call out their friend. The key points here are the context of ongoing insults, the friend's behavior, and the author's response. The author felt attacked and finally stood up for themselves by addressing the root issue they believed was causing the friend's problems. However, mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if the author's response was a valid defense or if it crossed a line. The friend's comments were personal and possibly hurtful, so the author might feel justified in responding. But criticizing someone's personal life, especially regarding their parenting and relationships, can be sensitive. The author's statement about needing someone to accept the situation might be true, but was it the right way to say it?\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was seen as harsh or insensitive. The author's job in the adult industry might make them more defensive. The friend also tried the same job, so maybe there's a history there. \n\nThe author's response was direct and addressed what they thought was the core issue. But was it constructive? They might have been trying to help, but the method might have been unkind. Alternatively, after repeated insults, the author might feel they have the right to defend themselves.\n\nSo, the decision hinges on whether the author's response was a reasonable defense against ongoing insults or if it was an overreach. The friend's actions were definitely problematic, but the author's response might be seen as crossing a line, even if their intention was to help. The mutual friends' opinions also indicate that the community perceives the author as wrong. However, the author might feel they were just standing up for themselves after being insulted.\n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on how to handle such situations. But given the context of the friend's prior behavior and the author's intention to give honest feedback, some might argue the author wasn't in the wrong. Others might say that even if the friend was being mean, the author's response was unkind and could have been phrased better.\n"
