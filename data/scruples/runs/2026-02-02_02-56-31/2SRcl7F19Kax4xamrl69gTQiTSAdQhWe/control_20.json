It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because of having five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making insulting comments for two years, and the author finally snapped and gave a honest but direct answer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were personal and seemed to be attacking the author's lifestyle, like mentioning her job in the adult industry and her appearance. The author had been trying to brush off these insults with advice like focusing on oneself. Then, when the friend asked again, the author pointed out the friend's situation with multiple kids and no support, which led to a fallout.\n\nNow, the friends are siding with the friend, saying the author is privileged and shouldn't have said that. The author feels wronged because they think they worked hard and aren't entitled. \n\nI should think about whether the author's response was justified. The friend's behavior was clearly problematic\u2014making repeated insults and not taking responsibility. But when the author responded with the truth about her situation, maybe it was a valid point, but perhaps the way it was delivered was harsh? Also, the author's job in the adult industry might be a sensitive topic, so maybe the friend's insults were touching on that, and the author's response was a defense mechanism.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong? If someone is being bullied or insulted, standing up for oneself is understandable. However, making a direct accusation that might be sensitive (like implying the friend's situation makes her unattractive to others) could be seen as cutting. The friends' reactions might be influenced by their perception of the situation, maybe not seeing the friend's insults as bad as the author did.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a right to defend themselves after ongoing attacks. On the other hand, the response might have been too harsh or not the best way to handle it. The key is whether the author's response was a proportionate reaction to the insults. Since the friend was attacking the author's personal life and job, pointing out the friend's situation as a reason for her being single could be seen as counter-attack, which might not be the healthiest approach but isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nThe author's friends are blaming them for privilege, but maybe they don't see the other side. The author might not be privileged in that sense, especially given their hard work and non-traditional job. However, the way they responded could have been seen as judgmental, especially if it's a sensitive topic. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They were defending themselves after being insulted repeatedly. However, maybe there was a better way to handle it, but the act of standing up for oneself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
