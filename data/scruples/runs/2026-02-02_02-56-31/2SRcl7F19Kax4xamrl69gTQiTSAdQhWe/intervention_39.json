It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different dads is affecting her ability to find someone. The friend had been making insulting comments about the user's dating life and body, and the user finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the user's response was appropriate. The friend's behavior was clearly negative and insulting, which the user had been brushing off. The user's response was honest but might have been direct or harsh. The user's friend then reacted angrily and hung up. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the friend's situation (multiple children with different fathers and child support issues) makes it harder for someone to commit. That's a factual statement, but delivered in a way that might have been perceived as judgmental or hurtful. The user's friends are now side-eyeing them, suggesting the response was too harsh or judgmental.\n\nThe user is defending themselves by mentioning their own work ethic and the challenges they've faced. They feel their friend's issues aren't as significant. However, the user might not have considered the friend's perspective or the emotional impact of their words, even if the statement was true. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user was responding to two years of insults, which is understandable. But the way they responded might have been more hurtful than necessary. The key here is the intent and the method. The user might have been justified in feeling defensive but could have chosen a different approach to address the issue without being so direct. \n\nConsidering the mutual friends' reactions, it's possible the user crossed a line by pointing out the friend's situation in a way that felt like an attack, even if it was a factual observation. The user's response might have been seen as lacking empathy. So, while the user had valid reasons for being upset, the delivery could have been improved. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for the way they delivered their response rather than the content itself.\n"
