It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids with different fathers is why they're single. The friend has a history of making insulting comments, so the user finally called out the friend's situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made a lot of hurtful remarks, and the user tried to brush them off. But when the friend asked the same question repeatedly, the user responded with the truth they felt was the issue. Now, mutual friends are blaming the user for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, even though the user is defensive about their own struggles.\n\nThe user's main point is that they were tired of being insulted and finally told the truth. The key here is whether the response was justified. The user's friend's actions (five kids with different fathers) could indeed be a barrier to finding someone willing to commit, so pointing that out might not be wrong. However, the way it was delivered and the mutual friends' reactions suggest sensitivity around the topic.\n\nBut, in relationships and friendships, how we communicate is as important as the message. The user's response was direct and called out the friend's situation, which could be seen as cutting or insensitive, even if the underlying issue is true. Friends might feel that the user should have handled it more compassionately instead of stating the \"truth\" bluntly, especially since the friend was already in a vulnerable position.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends are emphasizing \"skinny privilege,\" which might relate to the friend's insecurities and how the user's comments about appearance could have added insult to injury. Even if the user isn't skinny, the friend might feel that the user's comments were judgmental about body image, which is a common sensitive topic.\n\nOn the other hand, the user was defending themselves against repeated insults and finally set a boundary. They might not be in the wrong for standing up for themselves. But in terms of friendship, sometimes the truth can be delivered in a way that's more supportive rather than critical, even if the criticism is valid.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the user's response, while truthful, was the best approach given the ongoing dynamic. There might be a better way to have addressed the friend's issues without attacking their situation, but the user's intent was to stop the insults. However, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the user's approach was perceived as harsh, which could indicate that they are at least partially at fault for not handling it more gently.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong because the response, while perhaps truthful, wasn't delivered in a way that considered the friend's feelings and the existing conflict.\n"
