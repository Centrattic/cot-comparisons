It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers and none of the dads pay child support. The friend had been making a lot of insulting comments over two years, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was repeatedly making personal and insulting remarks, which the author tried to brush off. Then, when the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer pointing out the friend's situation as a reason she's single. The friend got upset, hung up, and mutual friends are now saying the author is wrong and that they have privilege.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was in the wrong by making that comment. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the dynamics of the friendship. The author was defending themselves after enduring insults. The friend's questions were not just about her own situation but also directly attacking the author's appearance and lifestyle. The author's response, while honest, could be seen as pointing out a factual issue rather than an insult, but maybe it was still harsh.\n\nHowever, even if the friend was making the author feel attacked, responding with a comment about her having multiple partners and no support from fathers could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the author's statement is true, the way it was delivered might have been too direct and hurtful, especially since it's a sensitive topic. \n\nAdditionally, the mutual friends are calling the author privileged, which suggests that in their view, the author's comments were insensitive. The author argues they're not privileged and have worked hard, but the friends' reactions indicate that the author's response came off as judgmental. \n\nIt's possible that there was a more constructive way to address the friend's insecurity without pointing out her situation directly. The author might have intended to be honest, but the method could have been hurtful. Even if the friend was provoking, the author's response might have been the wrong approach. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong because the response, while perhaps true, was a personal attack that didn't address the friend's issues constructively. The answer would be A (yes).\n"
