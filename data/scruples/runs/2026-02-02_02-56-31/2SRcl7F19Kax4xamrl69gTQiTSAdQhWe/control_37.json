It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has five kids with different fathers and has been divorced five times. For two years, this friend has been making comments that the author finds insulting, like implying that the author's success in dating is due to her being skinny or other superficial reasons. The author kept brushing it off with advice like \"focus on yourself.\" Then, when the friend asks again, the author responds honestly that the friend's situation with five kids by different dads and no child support might make it hard for someone to commit. The friend gets angry and hangs up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, even though the author argues that they've worked hard and aren't privileged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has a history of making hurtful and untrue comments towards the author, which the author tried to ignore. The author's response was to point out a factual truth about the friend's situation. The key question is whether the author's response was justified or if it crossed a line.\n\nThe friend's previous comments were clearly personal attacks, even if they were disguised as questions. The author was defending themselves by pointing out a real obstacle the friend's choices might create. However, the way it's phrased could be seen as judgmental. The author is making a statement about why the friend isn't getting dates, which might come off as blaming the victim, even if it's true. The line between honesty and cruelty can be thin here.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that they perceive the author's comment as insensitive. They bring up \"skinny privilege,\" which the author denies. The author feels that their hard work is being overlooked. But the friends might see the author's comment as a privileged perspective, not understanding the challenges the friend faces.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's history of making negative comments. The author was responding to a pattern of behavior, so it's a defense mechanism. However, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe a better approach would be to set boundaries without being confrontational, or to not engage in the same tone. But the author was tired of being insulted and finally snapped.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response was within the bounds of a healthy friendship. Friends should be honest, but they should also be considerate. The author's comment, while honest, might have been unkind and could have been delivered more sensitively. However, given the context of ongoing insults, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for speaking the truth, but the way they did it might have been harsh. However, considering the friend's history of making hurtful remarks, the author's response was a reaction to two years of being put down. So, it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe the author isn't entirely because they were responding to constant negativity. However, there might be a better way to communicate that truth without cutting off the friendship. The answer might hinge on whether the truth was conveyed with empathy. Since the author was direct and the friend took offense, maybe there's a lesson in delivery. But given the circumstances, it's not entirely clear who is at fault.\n"
