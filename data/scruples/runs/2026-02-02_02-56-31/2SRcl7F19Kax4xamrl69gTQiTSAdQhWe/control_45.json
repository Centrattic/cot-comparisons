It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's single. The friend had been making insults about the author's weight, job, and dating life for two years. The author finally replied honestly, which led to the friend being upset. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they have \"skinny privilege\" and are being a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had been making personal and possibly untrue insults for two years. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses, but eventually, when the friend asked a question that was a setup for criticism, the author gave a honest reply about the friend's situation. \n\nThe key points are: the friend's behavior was ongoing and hurtful, the author's response was a direct cause of the friend's current situation (five kids with different fathers), and the author's intent was to be honest rather than hurtful. The author also mentions that they have two kids with one dad and a stable custody arrangement, which contrasts with the friend's situation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, the author was responding to years of insults, and their comment was based on a factual aspect of the friend's life. On the other, the way it was delivered might have been harsh, especially if it was a direct confrontation. However, the friend's prior behavior (insulting the author's work, implying the author is only attractive because of weight, etc.) was negative and possibly low-character.\n\nThe friends' reactions suggest they think the author was out of line. But the author feels they were defending themselves against untrue and hurtful comments. The line between standing up for oneself and being confrontational can be thin. The author's response was a truthful statement, but maybe the timing or method wasn't the best. However, given the context of ongoing insults, the author might have had the right to respond honestly when the friend's question was a trap for criticism.\n\nIn similar situations, it's often considered acceptable to address the root cause when someone's behavior is negative. The author's comment was a direct but honest response to the friend's situation, which is a valid point. However, the way it was delivered might have been abrupt, leading to the friend's anger. But considering the context, the author might not be in the wrong because they were responding to years of insults and the friend's question was leading to another put-down. The author chose to address the real issue instead of continuing to let the friend attack them.\n"
