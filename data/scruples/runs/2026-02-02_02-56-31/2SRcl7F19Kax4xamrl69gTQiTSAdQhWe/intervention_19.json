It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids with different fathers and no child support is why she's struggling to find someone. The friend has been making a lot of insults over two years, and the user finally responded with the truth. Now, mutual friends are saying the user is being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's friend has been making personal and insulting comments for a long time. The user tried to brush them off but eventually lashed out with a direct truth. The user's response was about the friend's situation being a barrier to dating, which might be true but could come off as harsh or judgmental.\n\nThe user's justification is that they were tired of being insulted and wanted to be honest. However, even if the statement is true, the way it was delivered might have been hurtful. The friend was already in a vulnerable position, and pointing out her circumstances could be seen as attacking her insecurities rather than offering support. \n\nAlso, the user mentions that mutual friends are accusing them of privilege. Whether that's valid depends on the user's tone and intent. If the user was being condescending or not empathetic, even if their own situation is difficult, the friend might feel attacked. The user's response could have been a direct answer, but maybe there was a better way to express it without being so direct. \n\nThe user's own situation (working in the adult industry, having an MBA, etc.) might not be relevant here, but the fact that they had a supportive partner and a stable situation could contrast with the friend's. The user might not have considered how their friend's self-esteem is affected by these comments. \n\nIn terms of friendship, even if the truth is valid, the delivery matters. The user could have addressed the friend's insecurities with more empathy, perhaps acknowledging the difficulty without making it about the friend's choices. The friend's reaction (insult fury and hanging up) suggests that the response was perceived as an attack rather than constructive feedback.\n\nSo, while the user might have been responding to a history of insults, the way they chose to respond might have crossed a line. The question is whether the truth was necessary in that context. Alternatives could have been to set boundaries without attacking her situation. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively, even if their intention wasn't malicious.\n"
