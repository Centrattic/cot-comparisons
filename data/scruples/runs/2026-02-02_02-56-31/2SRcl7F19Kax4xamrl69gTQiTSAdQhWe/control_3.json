It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is why she's still single. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making a lot of comments that the author finds insulting over two years. The friend is asking about the author's dating life with comments that imply the author has it easier, like mentioning being skinny, being a blonde, etc. The author finally responds by pointing out that the friend's situation with the kids and no child support is making it hard for anyone to take her seriously in relationships. The friend got angry and hung up. Now mutual friends are saying the author was wrong and that they have \"skinny privilege\" and are being a bad friend.\n\nHmm. The author is defending their response as being truthful. They feel they were being insulted and finally pushed back. But the friends think the author was harsh and judgmental. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe the issue is how they delivered the truth. Even if the comment was based on fact, the way it was said might have been unkind. The friend's behavior was clearly problematic, making repeated sarcastic and cutting remarks. But when the author responded with a direct, blunt comment about the friend's life choices, it might have been perceived as attacking rather than helping. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are pointing out that the author might have privilege (skinny, etc.) which makes them not understand the friend's struggles. So perhaps the author's comment, while technically true, was insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt they were defending themselves after being insulted for two years. They were honest about their perspective. But maybe a better approach would have been to set boundaries without making a judgmental statement about the friend's personal life. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own situation\u2014working in the adult industry, which might be a sensitive topic. The friend's comments about the author's job and dating life could be rooted in her own insecurities. The author's response might have been the last straw, but the root issue is the friend's behavior and the author's response to it. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The friend was definitely being rude, but the author's response might have crossed a line. Even if the author was tired of the insults, responding with a direct accusation might not have been the best approach. Maybe there's a better way to address the problem without attacking the friend's personal choices. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong not because the statement itself is false, but because of how it was delivered and the intention behind it. The key here is that the author chose to confront the friend in a way that was hurtful, even if they felt justified. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was too harsh and not supportive. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their response, while possibly true, was unkind and contributed to the conflict.\n"
