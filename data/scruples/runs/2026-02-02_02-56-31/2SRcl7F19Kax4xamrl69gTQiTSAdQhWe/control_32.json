It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making insulting comments for two years, targeting the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush off the insults, giving advice like \"focus on yourself.\" Finally, the friend asks a direct question, and the author responds honestly about the friend's situation with multiple children from different fathers making it hard to find someone. The friend is upset, and mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the insults, the build-up over two years, and the author's response. The author's friend was making personal, hurtful comments repeatedly. The author's response, while factual, was a direct answer to a direct question. However, the mutual friends are now blaming the author for not being understanding, suggesting the author is privileged.\n\nI need to assess whether the author's response was justified. The friend's behavior included personal attacks and insensitivity. The author's reply was a candid answer to an inquiry, but maybe it's possible they could have framed it more compassionately. However, given the friend's history of insults, the author might feel justified in pointing out the obvious factors affecting her situation.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how the author responded. Even if the friend was being rude, the author's response might have been harsh, especially if it wasn't delivered with empathy. The mutual friends see it as the author being unkind and not understanding the friend's struggles, even if the friend's actions were problematic.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? It's a tough call. On one hand, the friend was being insulting, and the author was defending themselves. On the other hand, the response might have been too direct, hurting feelings. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was inappropriate, even if the friend was being difficult. The author could have addressed the issue without attacking the friend's personal situation, perhaps offering advice instead of pointing out the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's behavior was inexcusable, the author's response might be seen as crossing a line, especially since it's possible to address the issue without being blunt and potentially hurtful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
