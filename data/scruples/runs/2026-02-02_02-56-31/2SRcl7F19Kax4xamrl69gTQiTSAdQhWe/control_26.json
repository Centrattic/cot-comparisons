It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for telling their friend that her single status is due to having five kids by different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making hurtful comments to the author for two years, including body-shaming and questioning her dating life. The author has tried to brush off these insults but finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation as the reason she's single. The friend then reacted angrily and hung up.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author's response was appropriate. On one hand, the friend's comments were clearly insulting and targeted the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author might have felt justified in pointing out the friend's own issues. But on the other hand, even if the friend was being insulting, the author's response was a direct accusation about the friend's personal life, which could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nThe friends' mutual friends are now criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author argues that they work hard and aren't privileged. However, the key point here is whether the author's response was a valid way to handle the situation. \n\nIn terms of friendship dynamics, it's generally not helpful to call out someone's personal choices, even if they are problematic, especially after they've been making hurtful comments. The author might have been justified in feeling frustrated, but the way they addressed it could have been more constructive. Instead of making a direct accusation, maybe suggesting support or understanding would have been better. \n\nAlso, the author's friend's behavior was toxic, but the author's response might have been too harsh and could have been seen as judgmental. Even if the statement is true, it's possible that the delivery was unkind and contributed to the fallout. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because while the friend was being rude, responding with an accusation about her personal life might not be the right approach. There might have been a better way to handle the situation without alienating the friend and mutual friends. The answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the response was a direct personal attack, even if the friend was being difficult.\n"
