It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author's friend has been making a lot of insulting comments towards her over two years. The friend has five kids with different fathers and is single, and she's been asking the author questions that come off as insults. The author finally tells her that having five kids with different dads and no child support makes it hard to find someone. The friend gets angry and hangs up. Now, mutual friends are saying the author is being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and untrue. The author tried to brush them off before, but eventually, she snapped. Her response was factual\u2014pointing out that the friend's situation complicates finding a partner. But was it an insult? The author wasn't attacking her character directly but stating a reality. However, maybe the way it was said was harsh, or perhaps the friend was sensitive about that topic.\n\nThe mutual friends are now saying the author is privileged and that she shouldn't have said that. They might think that the author is judging the friend's life choices, which could be seen as insensitive. The author argues that she's not privileged and has worked hard. But maybe her friends feel that she's not considering the friend's struggles or that she's making assumptions.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend had been insulting her for a long time. The author was responding to a pattern of behavior that was mean-spirited. But by pointing out the friend's situation, maybe she crossed a line. Even if the friend's questions were insults, the author's answer was a direct retort that the friend might take as an attack on her parenting or personal life. People might see it as valid to call out toxic behavior, but others might think it's unkind to bring up someone's personal issues, even if they're factual.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends might be defending the friend because they see the author as being privileged in terms of her body image or job. The author works out and has a healthy weight, which some might interpret as \"skinny privilege,\" even if the author isn't. The fact that the author works in the adult industry but has a stable income might be seen as different from the friend's situation. The friends could be taking sides because they feel the author's response was unkind, even if it was truthful.\n\nIn terms of better responses, maybe the author could have addressed the friend's insults without pointing out her personal situation. For example, setting boundaries or explaining that the comments were hurtful. But the author was tired of being insulted and wanted to be honest. However, in doing so, she might have made the situation worse by targeting the friend's insecurities.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she was responding to ongoing insults. On the other, her response might have been insensitive. Since the mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, it suggests that the community thinks the author overstepped. But maybe the author was justified in defending herself after being mocked for so long. However, the way she responded might not have been the best approach. Maybe the answer is that she's not entirely in the wrong but could have handled it better. But according to the options, it's A or B. Considering the friend's history of insults, the author's response was a direct truth, even if it was harsh. The friends might be biased. The question is whether the author was wrong to say that. If the mutual friends are saying she's privileged, maybe they're right in a way, but the author's intent was to point out a real issue. So, it's a tough call. The answer might be B (No) because the author was responding to ongoing insults and stating a fact, even if it hurt feelings. But some might say she should have been more tactful. Alternatively, A if the friends' perspective is that she was unkind regardless.\n"
