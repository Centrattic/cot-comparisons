It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been divorced five times, has kids with different fathers, and has been making insults towards the author. The author finally confronts her about her single status and the friend gets angry. Now mutual friends are side-eyeing the author. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author tried to brush off the insults for two years, which is a long time. But when they finally spoke up, they mentioned the friend's situation with five kids and no child support. The friend reacted negatively, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe key points are: the author's response was honest but maybe harsh. The friend's behavior included personal insults, which could be hurtful. The author's reply points out a specific issue that might be affecting the friend's dating life, but did they have the right to say that? \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author feels they're being unfairly judged. The question is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the child support and the number of children as the reason for the friend's situation.\n\nIn terms of social rules, friends might not expect such direct feedback, especially if it's a sensitive topic. Even if the statement is true, the way it's delivered matters. The friend might feel attacked or blamed, leading to the insult \"fury.\" \n\nBut the friend was also making untrue or low-quality insults, which the author had to deal with for two years. The author might feel justified in finally speaking their mind. However, in friendships, honesty needs to be balanced with empathy. The author could have addressed the issue without shaming the friend, perhaps focusing on support rather than pointing out flaws.\n\nThere might be a better way to phrase the response, like expressing concern without blaming. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's statement was a direct cause of the conflict, even if true, it might be seen as crossing a line. On the other hand, if the friend was being abusive, the author has a right to set boundaries.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because confronting a friend with such a personal and potentially hurtful truth, even if true, could be seen as unkind, especially after enduring insults. But some might argue the author had a right to be honest. However, the consensus in these situations often leans towards AITA being on the side of the person who made the direct, unfiltered comment. So I think the answer is A.\n"
