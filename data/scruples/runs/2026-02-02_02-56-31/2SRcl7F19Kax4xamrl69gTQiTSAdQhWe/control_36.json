It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has five kids with different fathers and is single, and the friend has been making a lot of comments that come off as insults towards the author. The author finally responds by pointing out that the friend's situation with the kids might be making it hard to find someone. The friend gets upset and ends the conversation, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend has been making personal and possibly hurtful comments over two years. The author tried to brush them off with generic advice, but eventually, the friend's questions were direct and maybe offensive. The author's response was to point out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulty in finding a partner.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are intent and the nature of the comments. The author was defending themselves after repeated insults. The response, while pointing out a truth, might have been a low blow, even if it was true. The friend's situation is complicated, but the author's comment could be seen as judgmental, even if it's a realistic observation.\n\nThen there's the reaction from mutual friends. They mention that the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled, not understanding the friend's struggles. The author feels this is unfair since they work hard and have their own challenges. However, the way the author responded might have come across as condescending or placing blame, which could be hurtful even if it's factual.\n\nAlso, the friend's behavior of making hurtful comments and then being defensive might indicate that she's struggling and projecting her issues onto the author. The author's response, while truthful, might not have been the most compassionate way to address it. In friendships, even if someone is being difficult, the way you respond can affect the relationship. It's possible that the author was justified in expressing their frustration but chose a method that was too harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was defending against ongoing insults and might have felt that the truth needed to be spoken. However, in terms of social norms, calling out someone's personal life in a direct and potentially shaming way, even if it's true, is often seen as crossing a line. The friend's actions (five kids with different fathers) are her own choices, and the author's comment implies judgment, which might not be the best approach.\n\nConsidering all sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were responding to harassment over two years. However, the manner of the response could have been more constructive. The key is whether the author's truth was delivered in a way that was supportive or just critical. Since it led to the friend being upset and mutual friends criticizing the author, it's possible that the author's approach was unkind and thus in the wrong. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is wrong) because despite the valid frustration, the response was hurtful and unhelpful.\n"
