It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking if they did the right thing by telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is why she's still single. The friend was making a lot of insulting comments towards the user, and after two years of brushing them off, the user finally called her out. Now the mutual friends are saying the user was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's friend was repeatedly making personal and insulting remarks about the user's appearance, dating life, and job. The user tried to deflect with advice, but when the friend kept pushing, the user responded with a direct truth about her situation. The user's main point is that the friend's situation with multiple children from different fathers makes it hard for someone to commit. \n\nNow, the user is defensive because their response was honest, but others are calling them privileged and a bad friend. The friend also tried the user's job, which might have influenced the user's comment.\n\nI need to evaluate if the user's response was a reasonable defense against the constant insults. The user was trying to be honest, but maybe the way they delivered it was harsh. The friend's behavior was clearly toxic, but the user's response might have been too direct or judgmental. \n\nAlso, the user's own situation is different: they have two kids with the same dad and a stable income. The user's job in the adult industry might make others judge them, but they're using it to make a living. \n\nThe key question is whether pointing out the truth about the friend's situation was justified. While the user had a reason to be honest after being insulted, the method might have been too blunt. However, the user was in a defensive position after two years of being attacked. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, sometimes honesty isn't the best approach if it's delivered without empathy. The user might have been better off addressing the friend's behavior without attacking her personally. But given the friend's persistent insults, the user might feel justified in defending themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, mutual friends are siding with the friend, suggesting the user overstepped. The user's response could be seen as shaming the friend instead of supporting her, even if the comment was true. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the user's intention was to be honest after being insulted, but the delivery might have been inappropriate. However, the friend's behavior was inexcusable. The user might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been better. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they were responding to ongoing insults, but there's a nuance here. Alternatively, maybe A (in the wrong) if the response was too harsh. But given the context, B seems possible. Hmm.\n"
