It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their friend has five kids with different fathers, all divorced, and has been making insincere and insulting comments about the user's personal life. The user finally responded by pointing out their friend's situation as a reason for her difficulties. The friend got angry, and now mutual friends are side-eyeing the user for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The user's friend has a history of multiple marriages without child support, which is a legitimate challenge in finding a partner. The user was being harassed with personal questions that were also insults, and after two years of brushing them off, finally responded with the truth. The user's own situation is different: two kids with one father, stable custody, and a higher income from a non-traditional job plus an MBA. They feel they've worked hard and aren't privileged.\n\nThe main issue is whether the user overstepped by pointing out their friend's history. The response directly linked the friend's issues to her having five children with different fathers and no child support. The user's answer was honest but might be seen as hurtful or judgmental, especially if delivered in a confrontational way. Even if the truth is valid, the manner of delivery and the context of the friendship matters. Friends might feel that while the truth is true, it's not helpful or kind, especially after repeated attempts to deflect.\n\nThe mutual friends think the user is privileged, which might indicate that the user's comment came across as dismissive of their friend's struggles. The user's defensiveness about their own work ethic and lack of privilege could be part of the problem, but the key here is whether the response was appropriate. The user was tired of being insulted and finally stood up for themselves, which is understandable. However, calling someone out for their own behavior in response to insults might not be the most effective approach, even if it's true.\n\nPossible alternatives could have been setting clearer boundaries earlier, explaining the impact of her comments without attacking her situation, or seeking to address the underlying issues in the friendship. By the time the user responded, it might have been too late, and the way it was said escalated the conflict. The user's honesty might be justified, but the delivery and the friendship's dynamics play a role. So, while the user isn't entirely in the wrong for standing up for themselves, the way they handled it could be seen as harsh, making them partially at fault. However, considering the prior context of insults, the user's response was a direct reaction to being attacked, which complicates things. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the user's approach was perceived as privileged and unhelpful, which might mean they did overstep, even if the truth was valid.\n"
