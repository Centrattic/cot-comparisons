It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a friend who has gone through five marriages and is now asking the author why they have dates and kids while she doesn't. The author finally tells the friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers makes it hard for someone to commit. The friend gets upset and hangs up, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The friend has been making comments that the author found insulting over two years. The author tried to brush them off, but when the friend kept pushing, the author responded honestly. The key question is whether the author's response was a valid way to handle the situation or if they overstepped.\n\nThe friend's comments about the author's body, job, and dating life seem pretty harsh. The author mentions they work out and have a healthy weight but aren't skinny. The friend's insinuations about the author's success in dating and work might be hurtful and untrue. The author might have felt targeted and finally decided to confront the issue.\n\nThe author's response was to point out the friend's situation regarding the children and lack of child support as a reason for her difficulties in finding a partner. This is a sensitive topic, as it's a personal and potentially stigmatizing issue. While the author's statement might be factually true, it could come across as judgmental or dismissive of the friend's struggles.\n\nMutual friends are now saying the author is privileged and that the friend isn't going through anything major. This suggests that the author's comment might have been seen as invalidating the friend's experiences. The author might not have considered the emotional impact of their words, even if they were meant to be honest.\n\nThe question is whether the author had a right to make such a comment. Even if the friend was making hurtful comments, responding with a potentially stigmatizing remark about her personal life could be seen as crossing a line. The author might have been justified in feeling frustrated but could have found a more constructive way to address the issue without attacking the friend's personal circumstances.\n\nAlso, the friend's behavior included repeated, low-quality insults, which might have contributed to the author's frustration. However, the author's response focused on a sensitive aspect of the friend's life, which could be perceived as attacking her insecurities. The friend's actions (five marriages, child support issues) are indeed challenging, and the author's comment might not have acknowledged the complexity of her situation.\n\nIn terms of friendship dynamics, the author was defending themselves against ongoing criticism, but the method used might have been harmful. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's approach was not well-received and may have been seen as unkind, even if the intention was to be truthful.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because their response was a direct attack on a personal and sensitive issue, even if it was in response to the friend's insults. The key is whether the author's response was a proportionate and kind way to address the situation. Since the comment focuses on a stigmatizing aspect of the friend's life and caused significant upset, it's possible that the author overstepped, making them at least partially responsible.\n"
