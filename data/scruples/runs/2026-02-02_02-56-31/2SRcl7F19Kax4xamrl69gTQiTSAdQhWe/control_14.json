It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids by different fathers is why she's still single. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been making insulting comments about the author's appearance, job, and dating life for two years. The author has been brushing them off but finally responded with a blunt truth about the friend's situation. The friend got angry and hung up. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they have privilege and are being a bad friend.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend's behavior has been hurtful and persistent, the author's response was honest but potentially harsh. The question is if the author crossed a line.\n\nThe author's response was to point out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her dating struggles. While it's true that having multiple children from different fathers can make it harder to find a partner, the way it's said might be seen as judgmental. However, the friend had been making personal attacks, so maybe the author felt justified in finally responding with the truth.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the friend was being rude, the author's response might have been too direct. It's possible that the friend was already sensitive about her situation, and the comment could have come across as shaming, even if it's factual. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that they think the author overstepped, possibly because the comment could be seen as pointing out a flaw the friend might not want to hear, even if it's true.\n\nBut the author had been trying to deflect the insults, so maybe they had a right to finally speak up. The friend's behavior was ongoing and hurtful, so the author's response might be seen as a reaction to being bullied.\n\nIn terms of social norms, calling someone out on personal issues, even if it's true, can be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's done in a confrontational way. However, the friend had been making similar attacks, so the author might be justified in responding with the truth they saw as the reason.\n\nBut the mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and doesn't understand the friend's situation, which is a common criticism when someone calls out another's personal choices. It's possible the author's comment was harsh, even if it's true, leading to the friend's outburst.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for being too direct, even if the friend was rude. The better approach might have been to address the insults without shaming the friend's life choices. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because the friend was being mean first. However, the author's response could have been seen as attacking a sensitive issue, making it worse. So probably A.\n"
