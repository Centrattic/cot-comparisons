It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has five kids with different fathers and is divorced five times. The author's friend has been making a lot of hurtful comments about her, and the author finally snaps by pointing out the friend's situation as the reason for her being single. Now the mutual friends are sideswiping the author, saying they're privileged and the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014she's making personal insults about her friend's weight, job, and dating life. These comments are both untrue and mean. The author tried to brush them off for two years but finally responds with the truth about the friend's situation. The author's response is factual but direct, and the friend reacts strongly.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend was being hurtful and it's been going on for two years. The author's response, while maybe blunt, was in response to persistent insults. The author's intent was to stop the cycle of negative comments by addressing the root cause they saw. However, the way they responded might have come off as judgmental, even if it's true. The mutual friends are now criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and entitlement, but the author feels they're being unfairly judged.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the friend was being a jerk, calling someone out on their own behavior can be tricky. The author's response was honest but maybe not the most tactful. The friend's actions don't excuse the author from being considerate. However, the friend's behavior was clearly toxic, and the author had tried to ignore it for a long time. The question is whether the response was justified given the context.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, sometimes pointing out someone's behavior is necessary, especially when it's harmful. But it's important how it's delivered. The author might not be in the wrong because they were defending themselves against harassment. On the other hand, maybe a better approach would have been to express the concern without blaming the friend directly. But given the repeated insults and the friend's unwillingness to change, the author's response might be seen as a justified stand-up for themselves.\n\nBut then again, the mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, suggesting that the author's response was too harsh. The author might be in the right for standing up for themselves, but maybe the way they did it was not the best approach. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the friend was the one initiating the insults, and the author was responding to protect themselves, I think the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
