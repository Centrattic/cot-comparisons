It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is why she's single. The friend was making hurtful comments, and the author finally snapped by pointing out the friend's situation. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend had been making personal attacks for two years, like commenting on the author's weight or job. The author tried to brush it off, giving generic advice. Then, when the friend asked why she couldn't get dates, the author responded with the truth about the five kids and child support.\n\nThe mutual friends are now criticizing the author, saying they're privileged and a bad friend. The author feels wronged because they worked hard and didn't mean to be harsh. \n\nI should consider if the author's response was justified. The friend's behavior was definitely disrespectful, but the author's reply directly called out a personal issue. Even if true, bringing up someone's personal life in a harsh way can be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's not the first time the topic was brought up. \n\nThe author might have a valid point about the friend's situation affecting her dating life, but the way it was delivered\u2014during a conversation filled with insults\u2014could be seen as adding insult to injury. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was too personal and hurtful, even if the intent was to be honest.\n\nAlso, the author's job in the adult industry might make others judge them more harshly, which could explain why friends are taking the friend's side. The author's response might have been a defensive reaction after being attacked, but it still could be seen as unkind.\n\nIn the end, while the author had been wronged, the direct and personal response might be considered inconsiderate. There might have been a better way to address the situation without attacking the friend's personal history. So, the author is probably in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
