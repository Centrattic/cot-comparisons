It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who has five kids with different fathers and is single, and the friend is constantly making hurtful comments to the person. The person finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as a reason why she can't find a partner. The friend gets angry, and now mutual friends are criticizing the person for being privileged and not understanding.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics of the friendship. The friend's comments are clearly mean and personal, targeting the person's weight, job, and dating life. The person tried to brush them off but eventually snapped. The response given was pointing out the friend's situation with multiple children by different fathers and lack of child support. The question is whether that response was justified.\n\nOn one hand, the person was defending themselves from ongoing insults. They might have felt that their friend's behavior was unfair and they were just calling out the obvious reason. On the other hand, bringing up the friend's personal issues might be seen as attacking her character, even if it's true. Friends often don't talk about such sensitive topics directly, especially if it's not the person's place to give advice.\n\nThe person's job in the adult industry is mentioned, which others might judge, but they also have an MBA and another job. The friend's comments about her work might be envious or judgmental. The person's response was honest but could come off as harsh, even if accurate. The friend might take it as an accusation, leading to her anger.\n\nThe mutual friends are saying the person is privileged, which adds another layer. The person argues they worked hard, but the friend's friends might not see her issues as valid. It's possible that both sides have valid points, but the way the person delivered the truth might have been unkind.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the response was an appropriate defense or an unkind attack. Since the friend was being insulting, the person had a reason to push back, but the method might have been too direct. Maybe a better approach was to set boundaries without attacking the friend's personal life. So, while the person isn't entirely in the wrong, their response might have crossed a line. The answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because even if the truth is true, delivering it in that manner hurt the friend and caused a fallout. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they were defending themselves from ongoing insults. It's a bit tricky, but in many cases, honesty without kindness can still be hurtful. So, maybe A.\n"
