It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend has five kids with different fathers and is still single. The friend has been making a lot of comments that the author finds insulting, like implying the author is only successful in dating because she's skinny or a blonde, and questioning the author's work in the adult industry. The author finally responds by pointing out that the friend's five kids with different dads might be a reason she's having trouble finding someone. The friend got angry and hung up, and now mutual friends are saying the author is in the wrong for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making personal and possibly hurtful comments for two years, which the author has been brushing off. The author's response was a direct statement about the friend's situation. The author is defending themselves against what they see as untrue and low-quality insults. The friend's comments are not just about the author's dating life but also touch on sensitive topics like the author's job and body weight.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author's response was a reasonable defense against the friend's insults and if it crossed a line. The friend's situation is complicated with multiple children and maybe financial issues, but she's also been making negative remarks. The author's response was honest and addressed the root of the issue they thought was causing the friend's problems. However, bringing up someone's personal life, especially regarding children, can be very sensitive and potentially hurtful. Even if the author believes it's the truth, the way it's presented might be seen as cutting or judgmental, especially if it's not the friend's intention to change her behavior.\n\nAlso, mutual friends are reacting by accusing the author of entitlement, possibly because the author's job and lifestyle might be seen as different or privileged compared to the friend's. The author mentions working in the adult industry, which might lead to different societal perceptions. However, the author's response might be seen as a valid counterargument to the friend's criticisms, especially if the friend is projecting her own issues onto the author.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. While the friend's comments were unkind, directly pointing out someone's personal situations can be harsh. There might have been a better way to address the friend's behavior without making a personal attack. The author could have expressed that the comments were hurtful and set boundaries without revealing the specific reason related to the five children. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong not because the statement was factually incorrect, but because it was delivered in a way that was confrontational and possibly hurtful, especially given the friend's history of making similar comments. The author could have handled it differently to avoid escalating the conflict. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to be cautious here. Alternatively, if the author was just responding truthfully to the friend's attacks, maybe it's not their fault. The line between defending oneself and attacking is thin here. Given that the friend's comments were already personal and the author was trying to address the root issue, maybe B (not in the wrong) is the case. However, mutual friends are reacting negatively, which suggests that the author's approach was inappropriate. So, likely A is the answer.\n"
