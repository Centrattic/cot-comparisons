It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. So, the user is asking if they did something wrong by telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is affecting her dating life. The friend was making sarcastic and insulting comments about the user's appearance and dating life for two years, and the user finally called her out. Now, mutual friends are side-eyeing the user, saying they have privilege and were wrong to say that.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the user's response was appropriate. The friend was persistently making snide remarks, which the user brushed off. But when the friend continued to badger them about their dating life, the user gave a direct answer pointing out the friend's situation as the issue. The user's reasoning was based on the idea that having five kids with different fathers might make it harder for someone to commit, especially if the fathers aren't supporting the kids. That seems like a factual observation, but it's also a sensitive topic.\n\nNow, the user is facing backlash from mutual friends. The friends are saying the user has privilege and was entitled. But the user argues they worked hard and aren't privileged. The user's job in the adult industry and having an MBA might add layers here. Also, the user has two kids with one dad, which might be seen as more stable.\n\nThe key points are: Did the user cross a line by pointing out the friend's situation? Was it a valid response after years of insults? The user's intention was to be honest and stop the insults. However, bringing up someone's situation about multiple children and lack of support can be very personal and potentially hurtful, even if it's true. It's possible that while the user was trying to be truthful, it came off as judgmental or insensitive, especially given the history of insults. Sometimes, even if something is true, the way it's delivered matters. The user might have been justified in standing up for themselves, but the method could have been more compassionate.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was also problematic, making repeated insults. The user had been trying to avoid conflict by deflecting, but eventually, setting a boundary is reasonable. However, the mutual friends' reactions might indicate that the user's response was perceived as harsh, even if their intention was to be honest.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was a reasonable response to the provocation. Here, the user was provoked by two years of insults but responded with a direct truth. It's a tough balance between self-defense and being judgmental. The answer might hinge on whether the user's response was a valid defense of their own boundaries or if it was an overreach. Given the context, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have issues. However, the user's response, while honest, might have been too direct and could have been more tactfully phrased to avoid further conflict. So, there's a chance the user is in the wrong for the way they delivered the message, even if the content had merit.\n"
