      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for their friend. The friend rides in their car a lot, and the writer ends it after the friend put $10 in gas once because they forgot their purse. The friend had ridden hundreds of times without contributing before.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the friend's consistent use without contribution and the one-time payment when it was inconvenient for the writer. The writer ended it by telling the friend to find another way. \n\nFirst, I should consider if the writer was being unfair. The friend used the car hundreds of times for free, so the one-time $10 gas is minimal compared to the total cost. The writer might have felt taken advantage of, which is reasonable. The friend's action of putting in $10 when it was a mistake might not be enough to justify the ongoing rides. \n\nAlso, the writer is asking if they're an asshole for ending it. The friend's behavior could be seen as free-riding, so the writer isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. There's no indication the writer was rude or unreasonable. They just stopped a habit that wasn't fair. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're asserting their right to not be taken advantage of. The friend should have contributed more often, and the writer is ending a one-sided arrangement.\n"
