      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been riding in their car hundreds of times without contributing gas money, but this time put in $10 after the user forgot their purse. The user then told the friend to find their way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in such a friendship. Normally, when someone gives a ride, it's common courtesy to offer gas money, especially if it's a regular thing. The friend in this case did that once, but the user is ending the arrangement now. The user might feel that contributing $10 after hundreds of free rides is insufficient or inconsistent.\n\nThe user's friend might have thought that since the user forgot their purse, they should return the money, but the user is taking it as an opportunity to set a boundary. The user's action could be seen as standing up for themselves, as they're no longer allowing the friend to ride for free. On the other hand, ending the rides abruptly might be seen as harsh, especially if the friend has relied on these rides for a long time.\n\nBut the key here is the friend's past behavior. If they've never contributed before and only did so once, the user is within their rights to demand compensation. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary after being taken advantage of. Also, the friend might not have been aware that the user expected gas money each time, so communication could have been an issue. However, the user's response of ending all rides might be a bit extreme, but given the context, it's a way to enforce fairness.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's acceptable to ask for gas money if you're regularly giving rides. The user isn't wrong for stopping the rides after the friend only contributed once. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
