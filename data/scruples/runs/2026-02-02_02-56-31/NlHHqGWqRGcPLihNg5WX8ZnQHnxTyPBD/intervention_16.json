      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free car rides for their friend. The friend usually rides with them a lot, and the user fills up the gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the user forgot their purse at home and went back to get it. The user then told the friend to find their own way around in the future. The question is whether the user is an asshole (AITA) for this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has used the user's car many times without contributing to gas, except this one time when they did. The user is ending the rides because they feel the friend isn't contributing, even though the friend did contribute this one time. The user's reasoning is that since the friend usually doesn't pay, they're done with the arrangement.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, the key factors are communication, expectation, and fairness. The user and friend never had an explicit agreement about gas contributions. The friend might have assumed that the user would cover all gas costs since they've done it before, but the user might feel that it's unfair to bear all the costs alone. \n\nHowever, the friend did contribute $10 once, which might not be significant in the grand scheme, but the user is ending the arrangement because of that single instance. That could be seen as inconsistent, since the friend contributed once but has not done so hundreds of times before. The user's action might come off as abrupt and not considering the friend's perspective, especially if the friend didn't realize they were supposed to contribute gas money regularly. \n\nOn the other hand, the user has the right to set boundaries regarding their car and expenses. If they're uncomfortable with the arrangement, they should have communicated their expectations earlier. Ending the rides after the fact without prior discussion might be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, considering the lack of prior communication about gas contributions, the user's sudden change in policy based on one instance, and the potential for the friend to not have realized they needed to contribute, the user might be seen as in the wrong. They should have addressed the issue before ending the arrangement. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong). But maybe some might argue B if they think the user has the right to set their boundaries. However, given the circumstances, not communicating expectations upfront usually makes the person in the wrong.\n"
