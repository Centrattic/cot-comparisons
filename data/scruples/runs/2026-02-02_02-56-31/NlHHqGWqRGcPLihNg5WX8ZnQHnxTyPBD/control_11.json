      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, the author fills up the gas, picks them up, and drops them off. Once, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. The author then said the friend should find their way around in the future. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The friend uses the author's car regularly without contributing to gas, except once. The author is ending the rides because the friend didn't contribute before. The key points are: the friend has taken many free rides, the one time they did put gas was when the author forgot their purse, and now the author is cutting them off. \n\nThe author might feel that since the friend only contributed once, it's unfair to continue providing rides without compensation. On the other hand, the friend might feel that the one time they contributed was enough, but the author is ending it because they didn't contribute before. However, the friend's single act of contributing might not set a precedent for ongoing contributions. \n\nThe author's decision could be seen as standing up for their own resources. They are using their car and money for gas, which is a personal expense. If the friend expects to ride regularly, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The fact that the friend only put gas once (and only because the author forgot their purse) might indicate that the friend isn't considering the ongoing cost. \n\nBut maybe the author should have addressed the issue earlier instead of ending it suddenly. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The core issue is about fairness and mutual contributions. Since the friend didn't contribute most of the time, the author's decision to stop might be justified. The answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
