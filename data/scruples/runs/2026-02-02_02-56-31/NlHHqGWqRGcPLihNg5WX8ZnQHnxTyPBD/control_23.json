      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for their friend.\n\nThe friend regularly takes rides in the author's car, with the author covering gas costs. Last time, the author forgot their purse, and the friend put in $10 for gas. Then the author asked for the money back. The friend had ridden hundreds of times without contributing before. The author then says they told the friend to find their way around in the future. The question is if the author is an asshole for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend has been using the author's car without paying gas for hundreds of times. This implies that the arrangement was informal or perhaps implied, but the friend didn't contribute. The author might have felt it was unfair to cover all the costs alone. Then, when the author forgot their purse, the friend put in $10. The author then asked for that back. The friend might have expected that since they contributed once, the author would continue to allow rides without further payment. However, the author decided to stop the free rides, hence the friend now needs to find another way. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that the friend has been taking advantage of their generosity. They might have been covering the gas costs entirely, which can add up over time, especially with frequent use. When the friend finally contributed once, the author might have felt it was a sign that the friend should start paying for their own rides, hence ending the free rides. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought that contributing $10 once was sufficient or that the author would continue to provide rides as before. The sudden change in policy could be seen as abrupt, especially if the author didn't communicate the expectation for future payments earlier. However, the fact that the author asked for the $10 back suggests they wanted to be compensated for the gas, which is reasonable. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had a responsibility to continue providing rides without charging, or if the friend had an obligation to contribute. Since the friend never contributed before and the author is now ending it, it's about fairness and communication. The author might have set the precedent by asking for the $10 back, indicating they expect payment. The friend might not have realized that the author wanted ongoing contributions. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's common for friends to split gas when carpooling, if one person consistently doesn't contribute, the other might feel resentful. The author is ending the arrangement, which could be justified if they felt it was unfair. However, if the author didn't clearly communicate the expectation for payment earlier, the friend might feel blindsided. \n\nBut in this case, the author did ask for the $10 back, which could signal that they want payment. So when the friend didn't pay again, the author ended the rides. This could be seen as standing up for themselves. Alternatively, maybe the author should have addressed the issue sooner instead of waiting until now. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're setting boundaries after being asked to reimburse for a past expense. However, if the author didn't communicate the change in policy clearly, that could be an issue. But given the information, the author is acting on their own terms after the friend didn't pay before and then only put in $10 once. The author's decision to end the rides might be a reasonable response to stop being taken advantage of.\n"
