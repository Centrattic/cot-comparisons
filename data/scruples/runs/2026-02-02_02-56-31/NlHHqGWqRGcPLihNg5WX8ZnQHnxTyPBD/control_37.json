      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been riding in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once when the friend put $10 in gas after the author forgot their purse and the friend offered to return it. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in such a friendship. The friend has been using the author's car regularly without contributing to gas, which is a recurring thing. The author covers all the gas costs. Then, one time, the friend offers gas money as a gesture, but the author is now ending the rides. The friend might have thought that since they have done it so many times without contributing, maybe they can keep doing so. But the author feels it's unfair and decides to stop.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it's about fairness and boundaries. The author is setting a boundary here. If they feel that their friend isn't contributing and they're being used, it's reasonable to expect some contribution, especially if they're using the car a lot. The friend might not have realized that the author expects gas money. The fact that the friend once offered $10 might not be enough for the author, especially if it's after hundreds of free rides. The author is asserting their right to not be taken advantage of. On the other hand, the friend might have expected that using the car occasionally is a favor, and the author is overreacting. But since the friend is using the car so frequently, maybe the author is justified in setting a boundary. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are standing up for themselves after the friend's consistent use without contribution.\n"
