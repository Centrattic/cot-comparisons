      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been getting rides in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, the user forgot their purse at home, and the friend put $10 in gas when they came to get it back. The user then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is an asshole (A) or not (B). I need to think about this from both sides. \n\nFirst, the user's perspective: they've been covering all the gas costs for hundreds of rides. That's a lot of money. The friend didn't contribute until this one time when they needed to get the purse back. The user might feel taken advantage of, right? They might feel like the friend isn't considering their expenses. It's possible the user is setting a boundary here, which is a good thing. People need to set boundaries, especially when others take advantage of their generosity.\n\nOn the friend's side, maybe they didn't think about the cost before. Or maybe they thought it was a small thing. But if they've been doing it for hundreds of times, even a small amount per ride adds up. The fact that the friend only put $10 in once might not cover the actual cost, especially if they've ridden many times. The user might have a right to be upset because the friend hasn't contributed their fair share.\n\nBut is ending the rides the right approach? The user is saying \"find your way around in the future.\" That could be seen as cutting off a favor that was previously given. If the user didn't communicate their expectations earlier, maybe there's some fault there. But if the user has been doing this for a long time and suddenly decides to stop, it's understandable if they want to set boundaries, especially if it's costing them money.\n\nI think the key points are: the friend used the car many times without contributing, the user was covering all costs, the friend only contributed once when asked. The user is now setting a boundary. In situations like this, people often feel like they're not in the wrong when they set boundaries after being taken advantage of. So the answer is probably B (No, not in the wrong). The user is protecting their own resources and setting a fair boundary.\n"
