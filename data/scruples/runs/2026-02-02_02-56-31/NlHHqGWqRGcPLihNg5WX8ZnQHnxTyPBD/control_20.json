      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The situation is that the friend often rides with the author, uses their car, fills up gas once when the author forgot their purse, and then the author told the friend to find their own way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has been giving their friend rides regularly, paying for gas, and picking them up. The friend usually doesn't contribute to gas, but once they did put $10 in when the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way. The question is whether the author is an asshole (ITA) for doing that.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author has been providing a service (rides) without reimbursement most of the time. The friend contributed once, and the author ended the rides. The author might feel that the friend isn't contributing fairly, so they're ending the arrangement. The friend might feel that the one-time contribution was enough, or maybe they expected the author to continue helping.\n\nLegal or moral wrong isn't really the issue here\u2014it's about fairness or expectations in a friendship. The author is setting boundaries, which is common. If someone is constantly using your resources without contributing, it's reasonable to ask them to stop or contribute. The friend put in $10 once, but the author might feel that's not fair compared to all the times the friend didn't contribute. The author's response could be seen as asserting their right to set limits, especially if they feel taken advantage of. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author didn't communicate the expectation of contributing earlier. If the friend didn't know they were supposed to help with gas, then the author's sudden change could be abrupt. But if the author let it slide for hundreds of rides without mentioning it, maybe the friend assumed it was a one-sided arrangement. The author's decision to stop after one contribution might be seen as harsh if the friend's one act of helping wasn't enough to cover past uses. But if the author feels that the friend isn't contributing enough, then ending the rides isn't unreasonable.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often help friends out occasionally, but there's an expectation of reciprocity. If the friend isn't reciprocating, the author has the right to set boundaries. So the author isn't in the wrong for ending the rides. They're taking responsibility for their own resources and setting a boundary. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
