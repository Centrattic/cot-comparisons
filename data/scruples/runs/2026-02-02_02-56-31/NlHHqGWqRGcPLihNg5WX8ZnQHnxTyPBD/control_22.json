      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been taking rides in the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but once the author forgot their purse at home, the friend put $10 in gas. Now the author is saying the friend should find their own way around and is questioning if they're an asshole for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main points here are about fairness and reciprocity. The friend usually doesn't contribute, but once the author had a reason to ask for the purse back, the friend did put in $10. The author is now ending the arrangement. \n\nThe question is whether the author is justified in stopping the rides. The user is asking if the author is an asshole for doing so. In AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe friend's one-time contribution of $10 when the author forgot their purse might not be enough to justify the author ending all rides. The author is essentially saying that since the friend didn't contribute before, and only did so once when the author needed something, they're ending the rides. The author might feel that the arrangement was unfair, especially since the friend had been using their car for so long without contributing. \n\nHowever, the friend might feel that the one-time $10 was a gesture of goodwill, especially when the author needed the purse back. But the author is now ending the rides, which could be seen as a reasonable response if they felt the arrangement wasn't fair. \n\nIn many AITA cases, people are expected to communicate their expectations early. If the author didn't set boundaries from the start, maybe they have some responsibility. But since the friend never contributed until that one time, the author might feel it's unfair to continue driving them without compensation. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action of ending the rides is unreasonably harsh. Since the friend had been using the car for free, the author is within their rights to stop. They are not obligated to provide free transportation. The fact that the friend put in $10 once might not be a big enough reason for the author to continue, especially if they wanted to end the arrangement regardless. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries and decide who they drive and under what terms. The friend's actions don't necessarily make the author an asshole for changing the terms. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
