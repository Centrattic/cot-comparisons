      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. So the situation is that the friend has been getting rides in their car, and the user has been filling up the gas. The friend only put $10 in gas once when they forgot their purse, and now the user is telling them to find their own way. The question is whether the user is an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The user is the one providing the car, gas, and time. The friend is using that benefit repeatedly without contributing. The user is now asking the friend to not rely on them for transportation anymore. The friend's argument might be that they're helping out in some way, but in this case, the user is the one covering all the costs. The friend only contributed once, which might not be enough to balance the expense. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong here. They have the right to set boundaries about their car and expenses. The friend was using a resource that's not theirs, and the user is within their rights to stop allowing that. It's about personal property and financial responsibility. The user isn't obligated to provide rides for free, especially when it's costing them money. So the answer would be B, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
