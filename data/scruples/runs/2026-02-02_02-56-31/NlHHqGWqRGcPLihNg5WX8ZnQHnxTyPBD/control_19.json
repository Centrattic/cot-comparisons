      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend usually rides in their car without contributing to the gas, but this time put in $10 after the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been getting free rides for a long time, which might have been an unspoken agreement or just a favor the author was doing. The key point here is whether the author had an expectation of payment and if the friend's action of putting in $10 was enough to change that dynamic.\n\nThe friend only contributed $10 once, out of hundreds of rides. The author might feel that since the friend didn't contribute before, they're not being fair. But the friend might argue that this was a one-time gesture. The author's response to end the rides entirely might be seen as overreacting, especially if the friend's contribution was minimal compared to the total cost over time.\n\nHowever, the author is also within their rights to set boundaries. If they felt that their generosity was being taken for granted, ending the rides could be a way to enforce fairness. The question is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. Ending all future rides because of a single $10 contribution might be too harsh, especially if the friend hasn't consistently contributed. On the other hand, the author isn't obligated to continue providing rides if they feel it's unfair.\n\nAnother angle is the initial free rides. If the author didn't ask for payment before, the friend might not have realized it was expected. The author could have asked for contribution earlier, but now deciding to stop the rides might seem abrupt. But the author is also allowed to change their mind about the arrangement.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's friend was aware that contributing to gas was expected. If the friend was unaware, then the author might be in the wrong for not setting clear expectations. But if the author felt it was unfair and decided to stop, they're not necessarily wrong. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't fix the ongoing issue of not paying for gas. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the rides, as they're setting a boundary after realizing the imbalance. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
