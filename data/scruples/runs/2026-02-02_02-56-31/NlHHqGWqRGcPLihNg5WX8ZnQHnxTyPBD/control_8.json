      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been hopping rides in their car many times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse, and the author said to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been using the car frequently without paying for gas. This time, they did put in $10, but the author is ending the rides. The key points here are mutual expectations and fairness. The author might feel that since the friend is now contributing, maybe in a one-time way, but the author is ending the service entirely. \n\nThe friend might see the $10 as a gesture of goodwill, but the author is upset about the previous habit of not contributing. The author's action is to stop all rides, which could be seen as a reasonable boundary if they feel exploited. On the other hand, the friend might feel that this is too harsh since they did contribute once.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here. Socially, it's more about reciprocity. If the arrangement was always free, the author has the right to change it. The friend might have expected some form of contribution eventually. However, by ending it after one instance of contribution, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the friend used the car hundreds of times without contributing, the author's frustration is valid. \n\nAnother angle: the author is setting a boundary, which is their right. The friend might not have been aware that their frequent rides were a problem. The author's statement \"find your way around\" is a clear boundary. The friend's single act of putting gas might not be enough to justify continuing the rides. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries regarding their personal resources. The friend's expectation might be unreasonable if they assumed free rides indefinitely. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
