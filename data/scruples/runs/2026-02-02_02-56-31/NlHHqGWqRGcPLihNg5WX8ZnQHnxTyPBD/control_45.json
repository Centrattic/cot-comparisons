      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ending free rides. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas tank. Last weekend, the friend put 10 dollars in gas because the author forgot their purse. Now, the author is saying the friend should find their own way around.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and contribution. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, they put in $10 when they had the author's purse. The author is ending the rides because the friend didn't contribute before.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend did contribute once when they had the purse, but prior to that, they never did. The author is asking them to find their own way now. The friend might feel that the author is being unfair because they only asked for the $10 back once. But the author might feel that since the friend never contributed before, it's reasonable to ask them to take responsibility. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're setting a boundary after realizing they've been covering all the costs. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't negate the previous lack of help. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
