      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides to their friend. The friend has ridden in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but once the user forgot their purse, the friend put in $10 for gas. Then the user told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend used the car frequently, maybe took it for granted, and only contributed once when the user needed their purse back. The user is now cutting off the rides, and the question is whether that's justified.\n\nFirst, the user provided a service (transportation) without compensation. The friend only contributed once, which might not cover the cost over time. The user's statement about the friend finding their own way suggests they're done with this arrangement. \n\nFrom the user's perspective, it's about fairness. If the friend consistently uses the car without contributing, it could be seen as taking advantage. The one-time $10 might not be enough to offset the long-term costs. The user has the right to set boundaries, especially if they're feeling taken advantage of. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize they needed to contribute more. But the user hasn't mentioned discussing it before this incident. The sudden cutoff after a single contribution might come off as abrupt. However, the user has the right to decide how they want to handle their resources. \n\nLegally and morally, there's no obligation to provide rides unless there's an agreement. The user isn't in the wrong for ending something they didn't have to provide in the first place. The friend's actions could be seen as exploiting a favor, so the user setting a boundary is reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the user isn't in the wrong). They have the right to stop providing rides and set terms for their services.\n"
