      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been getting rides in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put in $10 for gas. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is providing a service (transportation) without compensation, which is a common situation in friendships. However, when the author had an oversight (forgetting their purse), the friend contributed $10. The author is now ending the rides, which the friend might see as unfair since they've only contributed once. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the author's perspective, they might feel that it's unfair to continue providing rides without any contribution from the friend, especially after so many times. They might see the $10 as a one-time gesture and not a regular contribution. On the other hand, the friend might feel that since they contributed once, it's still acceptable to continue getting rides for free, even though it's not regular.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for friends to help each other out occasionally without expecting payment. However, when it becomes a frequent or expected thing, contributing might be expected. The author is setting a boundary here by stopping the rides, which is their right. The friend's lack of consistent contribution could be seen as taking advantage, even if only once. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend hasn't consistently put gas in, only once. So ending the rides is a way to set a limit. There's no indication that the author was abusive or unreasonable in their request. The friend's behavior might be seen as parasitic if they're not contributing, but the author is just ending the arrangement. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting this boundary. The friend's actions might be the issue here, not the author's decision to stop. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
