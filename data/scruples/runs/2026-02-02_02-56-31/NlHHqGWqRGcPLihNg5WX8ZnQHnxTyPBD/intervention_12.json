      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend always rides with them, and the user fills up the gas tank. The friend put gas in once when the user forgot their purse, but otherwise has ridden hundreds of times without contributing. Now the user told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nHmm. So the main points here are: the user provides transportation regularly, the friend never pays for gas except once, and now the user is ending the rides. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFrom what I understand, the user is frustrated that their friend hasn't contributed to gas costs except once. They're ending the arrangement, which the friend might have taken for granted. The user's action is to stop providing the rides, which is a reasonable boundary if they feel taken advantage of. The friend's behavior of not contributing could be seen as expecting free rides, so the user setting a limit isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's about mutual respect and understanding. If the user felt that their friend wasn't respecting their time or resources, it's reasonable to set a boundary. The fact that the friend only contributed once might make the user feel that their generosity was not reciprocated. However, sometimes friends might not realize the impact of their actions. The user's action here is to stop the rides, which is a clear boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user should have discussed the issue earlier rather than ending it abruptly. But the user might not have wanted to confront the friend before. It's possible that the friend didn't see the gas as a cost they should cover, especially if they thought it was a small contribution. But the user's main point is that the friend took hundreds of rides without paying. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the user is covering all the gas costs, it's reasonable to expect some contribution if it's a regular thing. However, if it's a favor done occasionally, maybe not. But in this case, it's hundreds of times, so the user is justified in feeling that their resources are being used without reciprocity. \n\nSo the answer here would likely be B, No, the user isn't in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after their friend consistently took advantage of their generosity. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't make up for the hundreds of times they didn't contribute. The user has the right to decide how to use their resources and time, so ending the rides isn't an asshole move.\n"
