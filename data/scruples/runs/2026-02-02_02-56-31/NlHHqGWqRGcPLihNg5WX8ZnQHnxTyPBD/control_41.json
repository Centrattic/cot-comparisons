      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides in their car. The situation is that the friend always uses their car without contributing to gas expenses, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put $10 in gas. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has been providing rides hundreds of times without charging, which is a kind gesture. The friend has never contributed to gas before, except that one time when asked. The author is now setting a boundary, expecting the friend to take responsibility for transportation from now on. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Well, the friend has been taking advantage of the situation by not contributing to gas costs except when specifically asked. The author might feel that this is unfair, especially considering the ongoing expense of gas and maintenance. Setting a boundary here is about fairness and responsibility. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't negate the hundreds of times they didn't pay. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might see the author's request as sudden, especially since they've never been asked before. But the author is within their rights to change the terms. The key point is that the author isn't forcing the friend to ride with them anymore; they're just saying that if the friend wants rides, they need to arrange their own transportation. \n\nThe friend's behavior could be seen as parasitic, relying on the author's generosity without contributing. The author is asserting their right to set limits on how they use their resources. So, the author isn't in the wrong for establishing this boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
