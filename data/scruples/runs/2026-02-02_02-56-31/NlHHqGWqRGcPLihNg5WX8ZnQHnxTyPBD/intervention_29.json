      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually rides with them a lot, and the user fills up the gas. This time, the friend put in $10 for gas because the user forgot their purse. The user then told the friend to find their own way around. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been getting rides without contributing to gas, which is common among friends, maybe. But this time, the friend did contribute $10. Then the user says they're done. The user is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, they might feel that their friend has been freeloading, and this time, even though the friend contributed a little, they're ending the arrangement. The user might feel justified because the friend didn't contribute before. However, the friend putting in $10 might be seen as a gesture, but it's not covering the full cost of the gas, maybe. So the user is cutting ties, which could be seen as being assertive about their own time and expenses.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have expected that occasional contributions would make up for it, or maybe the user's request to find their own way is abrupt. The user's action could be seen as unfair if the $10 was a one-time thing and the friend usually didn't contribute. But if the user is tired of the freeloading and sets a boundary, that's reasonable.\n\nThe key points: the user is ending the rides after the friend put in $10, but the friend had been riding hundreds of times without contributing. The user's action is about setting boundaries, which is their right. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because they're asserting their own needs and expenses. The friend's one-time $10 doesn't negate the past freeloading. So the user isn't the asshole for deciding to stop.\n"
