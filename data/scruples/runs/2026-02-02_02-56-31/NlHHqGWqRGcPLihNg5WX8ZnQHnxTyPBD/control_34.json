      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the friend frequently takes rides in the author's car, with the author covering all gas costs. The friend usually doesn't contribute, but this time he put in $10 after the author forgot their purse. The author then decided to tell the friend to find their own way around in the future. The question is if the author is an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has been driving the friend multiple times without any contribution from the friend. The friend's action of putting in $10 this time might be a one-time gesture, maybe out of guilt or a realization. The author's response is to end the rides entirely. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is within their rights to set boundaries. Consistently covering all costs for someone else's convenience can be one-sided. The fact that the friend hasn't contributed before might indicate that the author is covering for the friend's lack of responsibility. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they've been doing this many times. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the friend's small contribution was a positive step, and cutting off rides abruptly could be harsh. But the author isn't asking for continued help; they're deciding to stop providing the service. The friend hasn't shown prior willingness to contribute, so the author's decision to prioritize their own resources is a reasonable boundary. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often consider whether the action was justified given the circumstances. Since the author is ending a one-sided arrangement, they're likely not in the wrong. The friend might need to find alternative transportation, which is a fair consequence for not contributing. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
