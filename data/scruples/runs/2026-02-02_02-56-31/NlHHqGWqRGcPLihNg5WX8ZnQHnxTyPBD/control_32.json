      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been riding in their car a lot, always getting picked up and dropped off. The user fills the gas tank themselves. The friend only put gas in once, when the user forgot their purse, and then asked the user back for it.\n\nSo the main issue is the user ending the free rides. The friend has been using the car hundreds of times without putting gas in. The user is saying now the friend needs to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of a friendship. If someone is using your resources (like gas) repeatedly without contributing, that could be seen as unfair. The user is covering all the costs, and the friend isn't contributing beyond that one time. The user is within their rights to set boundaries. Friends should ideally share the costs if they're using each other's resources, especially when it's frequent.\n\nAlso, the friend's action of putting in gas once was maybe a gesture when the user forgot something, but that doesn't mean it's a regular contribution. The user is just asking the friend to find another way, which is reasonable if the friend isn't contributing to the costs. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the user isn't wrong for stopping something that's costing them money without reciprocation. The friend might feel they've done enough, but the user's perspective is that they've been covering all expenses. So the user's decision to end the rides is justified because they're not being treated fairly. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
