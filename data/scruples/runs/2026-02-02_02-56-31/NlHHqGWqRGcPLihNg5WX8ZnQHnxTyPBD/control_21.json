      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often gets rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas. This time, the friend put $10 into gas because the author forgot their purse at home and later asked for it back. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas before. This time, the friend put in $10 after the author forgot their purse. Then the author ends the rides. The key points here are about fairness, past behavior, and whether the author overreacted.\n\nThe author might feel that the friend isn't contributing, but previously there was no contribution. The friend putting in $10 once might not be enough to justify ending the arrangement. The question is whether the author is being too strict or if they have a right to set boundaries. \n\nIn AITA posts, people often get called out for being too harsh when they overreact to a small issue. The friend contributed $10 once, which is probably not covering the cost of gas for all the rides. But the author might have had enough and set a boundary. However, the fact that the friend has never contributed before and now the author is ending it because of a minor contribution could be seen as unreasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to decide who uses their car and how. They might have had enough of the friend freeloading and using this incident as a catalyst to stop. But the friend's contribution was minimal compared to the number of rides they've taken. \n\nI think the community would likely side with the author because they are setting a boundary after the friend finally contributed something. However, the fact that the friend has never contributed before and the $10 is a small amount might make some people think the author is being too harsh. Alternatively, the author might be justified in ending the arrangement after the friend started contributing, especially if they wanted to change the dynamic. \n\nBut in the AITA context, the friend's action of putting in $10 isn't enough to justify ending all rides. The author might be in the right to set a boundary, but maybe the way they did it is too abrupt. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the friend's history of not contributing, the author's decision to stop giving rides could be seen as fair. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the rides, not whether the friend's action was sufficient. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is setting a boundary after the friend started contributing, which is reasonable. The friend's past behavior doesn't excuse the author from being in the wrong here. Alternatively, maybe the author is being too strict because the friend's contribution was minimal. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. But I think the author is justified in ending the rides, so the answer would be B.\n"
