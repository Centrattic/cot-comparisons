      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend regularly rides in the author's car, and the author fills up the gas tank, picks up the friend, and drops him off. The friend never contributes to gas except once, when he put $10 in because the author forgot her purse. Now the author is saying the friend should find his own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole.\n\nSo, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong (Answer A) or not (Answer B). \n\nThe key points here are about fairness and expectations. The friend has taken rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once. The author is the one handling the gas costs and the responsibility of driving. The friend's single contribution was a specific instance where the author needed help, but otherwise, he didn't contribute. \n\nIn many relationships, if one person is constantly relying on another for transportation, it can be seen as one-sided. The author is setting boundaries now, which is reasonable. The friend might not have realized that his frequent rides were a burden. The author isn't being mean by ending it, especially since the friend has only contributed once. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have addressed it earlier, but the key point is that the friend isn't paying for gas. The author is allowed to set limits on their generosity. So, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking back their time and resources.\n"
