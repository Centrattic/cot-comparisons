      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author's friend has been taking rides in their car a lot, hundreds of times. The friend usually doesn't put gas in the car, but once he did when the author forgot their purse. Now the author says they're done and the friend should find another way around. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that they've been covering all the costs, like gas and car maintenance, while the friend isn't contributing. Even though the friend put gas in once, the author is ending the rides. The friend, on the other hand, might think that occasional help is normal and that the author is being too strict now.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for friends to help each other out occasionally, but when it's a one-sided arrangement, it can lead to resentment. The author might be justified in setting boundaries if they feel they're being taken advantage of. The fact that the friend didn't contribute to gas most of the time could be an issue. However, ending the rides might come off as abrupt, especially after the friend did put gas in once. But if the author is tired of the arrangement, they have the right to decide how they use their car.\n\nI should also think about the tone here. The author is asking if they're an asshole. The key here is whether the action is unreasonable. If the author is setting a boundary after their friend's one-time help, but the friend has been a regular rider without contributing, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's about mutual respect and fairness. Since the author is ending the rides, not the friend, and the friend hasn't been consistent in helping with costs, the author's decision might be seen as reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're asserting their right to use their car as they see fit and setting a boundary after the friend's one-time contribution. The friend's past behavior of not contributing most of the time supports the author's decision.\n"
