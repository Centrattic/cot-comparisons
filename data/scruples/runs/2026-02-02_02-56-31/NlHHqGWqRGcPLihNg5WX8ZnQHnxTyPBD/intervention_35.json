      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has ridden in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put in $10 for gas because the person forgot their purse. Then the person said the friend should find their way around in the future.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether the person is being fair by stopping the rides. The friend didn't contribute to gas before, so maybe the person was covering all the costs. Now that the friend tried to help once, the person is ending the arrangement. \n\nWait, but the person ended it after the friend put in $10. Maybe they felt it wasn't enough? Or maybe they were just tired of covering all the gas costs. The friend might have expected to keep riding for free, but the person is now holding them accountable. \n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, if the friend was using their car without contributing, the person isn't obligated to provide rides. They can set boundaries. So maybe the person isn't in the wrong. But maybe the friend felt they were helping by putting in $10, so the person's response was a bit abrupt. \n\nBut the person is the one who owns the car and is paying for gas. They have the right to decide who rides with them and under what conditions. If the friend was taking advantage of the situation by not contributing, the person is justified in ending it. So probably answer B, No.\n"
