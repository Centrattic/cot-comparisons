      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been riding in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once when they put $10 in gas after the author forgot their purse. Now, the author is telling the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend always uses the author's car for rides, and the author covers all the gas costs. The friend only contributed once when reminded. The author is ending the rides because of this. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using your car regularly, expecting them to contribute to gas is reasonable, especially if it's a one-way ride where the driver isn't getting any benefit. The fact that the friend only helped once might indicate they don't see the need to contribute, which could be frustrating. The author is setting a boundary here, which is their right. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural or social expectation that friends help with expenses. But since the author hasn't mentioned any prior agreement about gas contributions, the friend might not have had a clear understanding. Still, the author is now ending the rides, which might be a reaction to the lack of contribution. \n\nI should also consider if there's any imbalance in the relationship. If the author is doing all the driving and covering all costs, it's reasonable to expect some help, especially when asked. The friend's one-time contribution isn't enough if it's a recurring expense. \n\nThe author's response to say the friend should find their own way isn't cruel, but it's a clear boundary. The friend might need to take responsibility for their own transportation now. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're setting a boundary after being taken advantage of. The friend's actions (only contributing once) might have led to this outcome. The author isn't obligated to provide rides without any contribution, especially over many instances. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
