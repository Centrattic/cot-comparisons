      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been taking rides in their car a lot, using gas, and the user is the one filling up the tank. The friend only contributed gas money once when they forgot their purse, and now the user is telling them to find their own way. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user has been the one providing the rides, covering all the gas costs, and the friend hasn't contributed much. The user is setting a boundary now, which is understandable. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough, especially if they've been using the car hundreds of times.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From an outsider's perspective, it's fair for the user to expect some reciprocation or for their friend to take responsibility. Since the friend hasn't been contributing, the user's decision to stop might be justified. So the answer would lean towards B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
