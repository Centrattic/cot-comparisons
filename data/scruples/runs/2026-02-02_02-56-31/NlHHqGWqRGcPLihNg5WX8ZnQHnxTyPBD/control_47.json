      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has ridden with them many times without contributing to gas, but once the author forgot their purse and the friend put $10 in gas. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around. The question is if the author is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend has been using the author's car regularly without any contribution. Only one time, when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. Now the author is ending the rides, and the friend is upset. The key points here are about fairness and expectations.\n\nThe author is asserting their right to set boundaries. The friend's occasional contribution was after a specific incident where the author forgot their purse. The author might feel that since the friend didn't contribute before, it's unfair to continue giving rides. The friend might expect that since they did contribute once, they should continue to ride for free. However, the author is setting a boundary, which is their right. The friend's behavior of not contributing gas before and then doing it once might be seen as opportunistic. The author is not obligated to provide rides, so ending them isn't necessarily wrong. The friend might need to take responsibility for their own transportation. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
