      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has used their car a lot, always picking them up and dropping them off. Last time, the friend put $10 in gas because the user forgot their purse. Now the user is saying the friend should find their own way around.\n\nFirst, is the user in the wrong? Well, the friend has been taking free rides hundreds of times. The user is finally setting a boundary. The friend's action of putting gas money last time might be a gesture, but the user is ending it. The question is about fairness.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, they've been covering all the costs (gas, time, maintenance) for a long time. It's reasonable to want to stop if it's becoming a burden. The friend might not realize the cost or take it for granted. The user is asking for accountability now. \n\nBut maybe the friend thought they were helping by putting gas once. However, the user is entitled to set boundaries. The friend might need to adjust, but the user isn't necessarily wrong for enforcing that. \n\nSo the answer would be B, No. They're not in the wrong. They have the right to decide who uses their resources and under what terms. The friend should have contributed earlier, not just once. The user is justified in ending the arrangement.\n"
