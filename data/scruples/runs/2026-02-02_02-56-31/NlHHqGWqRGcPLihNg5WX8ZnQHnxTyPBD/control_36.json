      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The author's friend has ridden in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but then this one time, when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the expectations of the friendship and the fairness of the situation. The author has been providing rides consistently without reciprocation, except for that one instance where the friend contributed. The author is now ending the arrangement, possibly feeling that the friend isn't contributing fairly.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers if the action was a reasonable response to an ongoing situation. The author might feel taken advantage of, especially if the friend never helped with gas before. The friend's single contribution might not be enough to justify the author's response, especially if the author is now cutting off all rides. On the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize it was an issue and the author should have communicated earlier. But given that the friend rode hundreds of times without contributing, the author's stance could be seen as justified. So the answer might be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
