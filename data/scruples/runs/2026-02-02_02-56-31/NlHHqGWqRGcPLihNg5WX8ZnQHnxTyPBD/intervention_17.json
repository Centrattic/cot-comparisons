      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has used their car a lot without contributing to gas, except once when they put in $10 after the user forgot their purse. The user now says to find their own way.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether it's fair to expect the friend to contribute to gas. The user is covering all the costs except that one time. The friend hasn't contributed much, which might be a burden on the user. \n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong for setting a boundary. From a fairness perspective, it's reasonable to expect that if someone is using your resources (like gas), they should contribute. The user is not asking for payment but is asking the friend to handle their own transportation now. \n\nThe friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing, so the user might feel it's unfair to continue covering the costs. Saying \"find your way around\" is a clear boundary. \n\nBut maybe the user's approach could have been more considerate. Instead of an abrupt end, discussing it earlier might have been better. However, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting the boundary now. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, they are not in the wrong) because it's reasonable to expect contribution when using someone's resources, and setting a boundary is justified here.\n"
