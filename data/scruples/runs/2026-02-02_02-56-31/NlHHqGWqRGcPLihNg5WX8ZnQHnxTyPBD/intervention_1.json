      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually rides in their car a lot, fills up gas when the person forgets their purse, but hasn't contributed to gas before. The person ended the rides by saying the friend should find their own way.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the person is wrong. So, the friend has taken many rides without contributing to gas except once. The person is ending it, probably because the friend hasn't been helping with expenses. The friend might feel taken advantage of, but the person might feel it's unfair to cover all costs alone.\n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the key is whether the action is reasonable. The person is setting a boundary after repeated free rides. The friend's single contribution isn't enough compared to hundreds of rides. The person is asking the friend to find their own way, which is a reasonable request if they're not willing to contribute anymore.\n\nBut maybe the friend didn't expect to pay and the person didn't mention it before. However, the person can't be expected to cover all the costs indefinitely without any contribution. So the person isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
