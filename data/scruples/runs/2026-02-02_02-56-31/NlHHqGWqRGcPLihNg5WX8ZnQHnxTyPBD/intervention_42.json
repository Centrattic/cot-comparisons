      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. So their friend has been riding in their car a lot, and the user fills up the gas tank. The friend only contributed $10 in gas once because the user forgot their purse and he returned it. Now the user is saying the friend should find his own way around. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to think about the dynamics here. The user is providing a service (transportation) without charging, which is a common practice among friends. However, when there's a cost involved (gas), it's reasonable to expect some contribution if it's a frequent occurrence. The friend has ridden hundreds of times without paying, but once contributed $10. \n\nThe user's friend might not have seen a need to contribute before, maybe assuming it's a one-time thing or not realizing the ongoing cost. The user is now ending the rides, possibly because they feel exploited or the cost is becoming burdensome. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, friends often help each other out, but there's a line when it's excessive. The user isn't forcing the friend; they're setting a boundary. The friend's lack of contribution over time might have made the user feel it's unfair, so ending it isn't unreasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user should have discussed it earlier instead of just ending it. But since it's their car and their money, they have the right to decide who uses it and under what terms. The friend might have taken advantage, so the user isn't the asshole for stopping. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
