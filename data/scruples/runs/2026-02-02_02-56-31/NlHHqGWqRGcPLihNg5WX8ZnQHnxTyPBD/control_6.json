      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend often rides in the author's car, and the author fills up the gas. Recently, the friend put $10 in gas when the author forgot their purse, and the author asked for the money back. The friend has ridden hundreds of times without contributing to gas. Now, the author says to \"find your way around in the future,\" meaning they're ending the rides.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend has been using the author's car for free, which is a lot of times. The author is covering all the gas costs. The friend only contributed once when asked. Now, the author is saying they're done. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel taken advantage of. They're putting in the money for gas and driving the friend around, but the friend isn't contributing. When asked for money once, the friend gave $10, but that's not enough compared to all the rides. The author is setting a boundary by stopping the rides. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that the author is being selfish or not considerate. Maybe the friend didn't realize the cost of gas or thought it was a favor. But the author is within their rights to set boundaries. They can choose who they give rides to and under what conditions. \n\nThe key point is that the author is stopping the rides because the friend isn't covering the costs. Since the friend has used the author's car many times without contributing, it's reasonable for the author to expect some contribution or to stop the rides if that's not happening. The author isn't in the wrong for setting this boundary. The friend might need to take responsibility for their part, but the author's action is justified. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
