      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ending free rides. The situation is that the author's friend has been getting rides in their car many times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put in $10 for gas because the author forgot their purse. Now, the author is telling the friend to find another way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has ridden hundreds of times without paying. The author is covering all the gas costs, including pickups and drop-offs. This seems like a one-sided arrangement from the friend's side. The friend's $10 contribution was probably just covering the cost of that one trip, but the author is ending the rides entirely now. \n\nIs the author justified? Well, if the friend was using the car as a free service without contributing, the author is within their rights to set boundaries. The friend's action of putting $10 might not be enough compared to the accumulated costs over hundreds of rides. The author is asking the friend to find their own way now, which is reasonable if they feel the arrangement is unfair. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have addressed the issue earlier instead of letting it build up. But in this case, the author is responding after the fact. The key point is that the friend hasn't contributed much, and the author is now cutting it off. The user is asking if the author is an asshole. \n\nMost people would see the author as not being in the wrong because they're setting a boundary after repeated free rides. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't make up for the long-term use. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
