      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending their friend's free rides.\n\nSo the situation is: the friend regularly rides in the author's car, and the author fills up the gas and picks them up. The friend only put $10 in gas once when the author forgot their purse, and now the author is telling them to find their own way around. The question is if the author is an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has ridden in the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The author is providing a service (transportation) without compensation. Then, the friend put $10 in gas once out of hundreds of rides. The author is ending the arrangement, asking the friend to find their own way.\n\nI should think about fairness here. If the friend is taking advantage of the situation by not contributing, then the author has the right to set boundaries. The fact that the friend only contributed once, and then the author ended it, might be seen as the author protecting their own resources. The friend might not be aware of the cost or might feel it's expected, but the author is within their rights to stop.\n\nAlso, in social dynamics, it's common to expect some reciprocity. If the friend isn't contributing, the author's decision to stop is reasonable. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for compensation once, especially if they're covering all the costs otherwise.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the friend expected the author to continue without issue, but the author is just setting boundaries after a rare contribution. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting some contribution towards the costs they're incurring.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is asserting their right to set boundaries regarding the use of their personal property (the car) and the associated costs.\n"
