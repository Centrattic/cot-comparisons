      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually rides with them, and the user covers all the gas costs. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the user forgot their purse and had to get it back. The user is now telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user is being unreasonable. The key points here are the history of the rides and the recent action. The user has been giving the friend rides for a long time, paying for gas. The friend only contributed once, when the user forgot their purse. The user is now ending the arrangement, possibly because the friend didn't contribute before that. \n\nIs it fair for the user to expect the friend to contribute? Well, if the user never asked before, maybe the friend didn't know they needed to. But the user is now ending the rides, which might be abrupt. However, the user is also covering all costs, so it's reasonable they might feel taken advantage of. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough for the user, especially if they've been giving rides for hundreds of times. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user should have communicated their expectations earlier. If they never asked the friend to contribute, the friend might not have realized it was an issue. Ending the rides now could be seen as a sudden change without prior discussion. But considering the user has been handling all the costs, it's also valid that they feel the situation is unfair. \n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often split costs for shared expenses. If the user was covering all the gas, maybe the friend should have offered to chip in. However, the user didn't mention this before, so the friend might not have known. The user's action could be justified by their feeling of being taken advantage of, especially after so many rides. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the user had a conversation about contributing to gas costs. If they never discussed it, maybe the friend wasn't aware. But if the user is now ending the rides, it's a reasonable response to their frustration. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough to change the user's perspective, especially if they had been expecting contributions all along. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries now.\n"
