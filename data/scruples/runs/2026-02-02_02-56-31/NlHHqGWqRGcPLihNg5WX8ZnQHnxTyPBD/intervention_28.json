      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been taking rides in their car a lot, and the user fills up the gas. The friend put $10 in gas once when the user forgot their purse, but has done it hundreds of times without paying. The user said \"find your way around in the future.\" They want to know if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is providing a service (rides) that has a cost (gas). The friend is using that service frequently but not contributing to the cost except once. The user is now cutting off the rides, probably because they feel taken advantage of. \n\nThe question is about fairness. The user is not obligated to give rides. If the friend isn't paying for the gas, especially when it's a frequent occurrence, the user has the right to set boundaries. The fact that the friend only contributed once might make the user feel like they're shouldering all the cost. \n\nHowever, the user might be overreacting if the friend didn't realize they needed to pay every time. Maybe the friend thought the $10 was a one-time thing. But the user never mentioned needing payment before, so maybe the friend assumed it was free. \n\nThe user's action is about protecting their own resources. It's their car and their gas, so they can decide who uses it and under what terms. The friend's usage without contribution could be seen as exploitative, especially over hundreds of times. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user never communicated that gas contributions were expected, the friend might not have known. But the user did mention filling the tank each time, which implies a recurring expense. The user's frustration is valid because the cost adds up over time. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. They have the right to decide how their resources are used. The friend's lack of contribution, despite occasional reminders, justifies the user's decision to stop the rides. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, I am not in the wrong).\n"
