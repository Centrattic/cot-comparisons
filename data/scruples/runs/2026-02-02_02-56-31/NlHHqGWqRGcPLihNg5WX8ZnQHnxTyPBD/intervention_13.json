      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free friend rides in their car. The situation is that their friend always rides with them, they handle the gas, and the friend only put gas in once when the user forgot their purse. Now the user said to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user is being unreasonable. The key points are that the friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, and this one time they did put gas in. The user is ending the rides because of that.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, consistently giving rides without any contribution from the friend might be one-sided. The user might feel taken advantage of, especially if they're covering all the costs. The friend's single instance of putting in gas doesn't balance out the hundreds of times they didn't. So the user might be justified in setting boundaries.\n\nHowever, maybe the friend had a reason for that one time. But the user's point is that they're ending the rides because the friend isn't contributing. The user isn't asking for a lot\u2014just to contribute to gas. It's reasonable to expect some reciprocity, especially if the friend is using the car frequently.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user could have communicated this earlier instead of ending it abruptly. But the question is whether the user is in the wrong now. If the user is tired of covering all costs and the friend isn't helping, then saying to find their own way isn't unreasonable. The user isn't forced to keep providing rides without any contribution.\n\nSo, probably the answer is B (No, not in the wrong). The user has the right to set boundaries and expect some contribution, especially when it's a recurring situation.\n"
