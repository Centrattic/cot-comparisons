      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually rides with them, the person fills up the gas, picks them up, and drops them off. Last time, the friend put gas in because the person forgot their purse. Now they're asking if they should find their own way around. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the moral aspect here. The friend has been getting free rides for a long time. The person is the one covering gas costs and the effort of picking them up. The friend only contributed once, when the person forgot their purse. The person is now cutting off the rides, probably because they feel the friend isn't contributing enough.\n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, they've been doing this for a while, but the friend has never paid for gas before. The friend might have expected the rides to continue, but the person is setting a boundary. On the other hand, the friend might have been relying on this, so ending it without prior discussion could be seen as abrupt. But the fact that the friend only contributed once might not be enough. \n\nIn many cases, when someone uses a resource (like gas) repeatedly without contributing, it's fair to set a boundary. The person isn't obligated to provide free rides. However, the way they ended it might matter. If they just said \"find your own way\" without explaining, the friend might feel blindsided. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the communication style. \n\nThe key points are: the person has been covering all costs, the friend hasn't contributed except once, and the person is now stopping. The act of ending the rides isn't inherently wrong because they have the right to use their car as they see fit. The friend wasn't obligated to pay before either, so maybe the person is just asserting their right now. \n\nSo the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong. They have the right to stop providing a service they were doing for free, even if the friend relied on it. The friend might be in the wrong for not contributing more, but the person isn't wrong for stopping.\n"
