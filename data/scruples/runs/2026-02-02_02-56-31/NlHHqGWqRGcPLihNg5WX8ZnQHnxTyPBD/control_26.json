      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend always rides in their car without contributing to gas, but this past weekend the friend put $10 into gas because the author forgot their purse. Then the author said the friend should find their own way around in the future. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend has been using the author's car for rides repeatedly, which implies a pattern of one-sided benefit. The author is covering all the gas costs and the inconvenience of picking up and dropping off the friend. The friend's single act of putting $10 into gas might be seen as a minor gesture, but the author feels entitled to stop allowing rides because the friend hasn't contributed consistently.\n\nI should consider whether the author is justified in ending the rides. If the friendship was based on mutual agreement, even if informal, then the friend not contributing might be a problem. However, the author hasn't mentioned any prior discussion about contributing to gas. It's possible the author assumed it was a free ride, but now feels taken advantage of. On the other hand, the friend did make an effort once, but maybe not enough for the author.\n\nAnother angle: the author is within their rights to decide who can ride in their car. If the friend's behavior was free-riding, then the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, the friend's one-time contribution might be seen as a sign of consideration, but it's not enough to change the overall pattern. The author's response could be seen as fair because they're no longer willing to bear all the costs. Alternatively, the author might be overreacting if the friend's gesture was a good faith attempt to help.\n\nI should also think about social norms. In many cases, splitting gas costs among passengers is standard, especially for long distances or frequent rides. If the friend never contributed before, the author might have a right to ask for contributions. The friend putting in $10 once might not be sufficient, leading the author to end the arrangement. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries and expect contributions if they feel it's unfair. The friend's one-time help doesn't offset the repeated free rides. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
