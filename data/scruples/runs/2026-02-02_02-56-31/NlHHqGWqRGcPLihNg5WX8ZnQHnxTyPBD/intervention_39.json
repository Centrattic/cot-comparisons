      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually rides with them a lot, and they cover gas. This past weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the user forgot their purse. Now, the user is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is an asshole (A) or not (B). First, I need to consider the context. The user has been covering gas for hundreds of rides. The friend contributed $10 once when they forgot their purse. That seems like a one-time exception. The user is now asking the friend to find their own way, meaning they won't provide rides anymore. \n\nIs the user justified? Well, the user might feel that the friend wasn't contributing to the cost of gas until now. However, the friend only did that once. Maybe the user is frustrated because they've been shouldering all the costs. But maybe the user also set an expectation that the friend would contribute occasionally, and when they didn't, the user decided to end the arrangement. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might see the rides as a courtesy, not a requirement to pay for gas each time. The user's request for the $10 was specific to retrieving their purse, not a general contribution. So maybe the user is overreacting because the friend didn't pay for gas in the past, but the friend only did the $10 once. \n\nAlso, the user is the one who owns the car and is providing the rides. They have the right to set boundaries. If they're no longer willing to provide free rides, they can end it. The friend might not have realized that the rides were a favor and not a given. \n\nBut then, the user could have asked the friend to contribute more regularly before cutting them off. However, the user might not have wanted to ask and just decided to stop after that one instance. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn similar situations, people often expect some level of reciprocity. If the friend never contributed until that one time, the user might feel taken advantage of. But the user could also have communicated their expectations earlier. \n\nConsidering all that, the user might not be in the wrong. They set a boundary after the friend contributed once, which might not have been enough. But maybe the user should have addressed the lack of contributions before this point. However, the friend only paid once, so the user might not have a strong case. \n\nHmm, maybe the user is justified in ending the rides because they've been covering all costs and the friend only contributed once. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the wrong for ending it over a single instance. \n\nI think the key here is whether the user's action is reasonable. If the user was fine with the friend riding for free but the friend only contributed once, maybe they're being unfair. However, if the user expected regular contributions and the friend never provided, then ending it makes sense. \n\nGiven the information, the user might not be in the wrong. They have the right to decide who they give rides to and under what conditions. So the answer is B.\n"
