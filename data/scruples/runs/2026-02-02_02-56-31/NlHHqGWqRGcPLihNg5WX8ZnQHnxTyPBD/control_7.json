      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free friend rides in their car. The situation is that the friend has been getting rides in their car without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put in $10 for gas. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author is providing a service (rides) without compensation beyond one instance. The friend has taken hundreds of rides without paying gas each time. The author is ending the rides, which could be seen as standing up for their own needs regarding time and fuel costs. The friend, on the other hand, might feel they're being asked to pay for something they've never been charged for before, except that one time.\n\nThe key points here are consent and expectations. The author didn't set any terms initially; the friend just started taking rides. The author might feel they're being taken advantage of, especially since the friend didn't consistently contribute. The friend's one-time payment of $10 might not cover the actual gas costs over time. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for friends to split gas costs when carpooling regularly. If the author didn't mention this expectation, maybe it's their fault for not setting boundaries. However, the author is now ending the rides, which is a reasonable response if the friend isn't contributing. The friend might not see it as a problem since they've never paid before except once. The author is asserting their right to stop if the arrangement isn't fair. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author didn't communicate the expectation of paying gas from the start, they might share some responsibility. But since they're ending the rides now after the friend didn't pay consistently, it's about setting boundaries. The friend's action of paying once might not be enough, making the author's decision justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting boundaries after a friend who hasn't consistently contributed to gas costs.\n"
