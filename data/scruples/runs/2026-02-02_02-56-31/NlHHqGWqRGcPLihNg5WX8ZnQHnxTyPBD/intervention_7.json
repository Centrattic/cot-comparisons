      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually rides in their car all the time, they handle the gas, pick up and drop off. This time, the user forgot their purse and the friend put in $10 for gas when returning it. The user then told the friend to find their own way around now.\n\nHmm. So the user is upset because their friend has taken advantage of the free rides for hundreds of times, and only contributed once. The user is asking if they're an asshole for ending it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's perspective is that they've been doing all the work\u2014gas, driving, etc.\u2014and the friend never contributed except once. So they're cutting off the rides, which seems fair from their point of view. They might feel taken advantage of.\n\nOn the friend's side, maybe they didn't think about contributing because it's been free all along. But when the user forgot their purse, the friend offered $10 to help out. That's a good gesture, but maybe it's just one instance.\n\nThe question is whether the user is wrong for saying the friend should find their own way. The user isn't being hostile, they're just setting boundaries after feeling exploited. The friend's contribution was a single act, not a consistent behavior. \n\nSo, the user's action is about setting limits after repeated one-sided help. The friend didn't contribute much, so the user's response is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong). The user isn't at fault here; they're taking back control of their resources.\n"
