      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually rides with them everywhere, and the user fills up the gas. One time, the friend put $10 in gas because the user forgot their purse at home. The next day, the user asked for the money back. The friend rode hundreds of times without contributing. The user then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nSo the main issue is whether it's fair for the user to end the rides. The friend contributed once but had used the car many times for free before. The user is asserting their right to not have their expenses covered by someone else. \n\nI need to determine if the user is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the user is within their rights to set boundaries. They provided a service (transportation) without being paid, but they can decide to stop if they feel it's burdensome. The friend only contributed once when the user was in a tight spot. The user's action here is about setting limits, which is reasonable. \n\nHowever, maybe the user could have had a conversation instead of an abrupt end. But the question is about being in the wrong. The user isn't obligated to keep offering free rides, so ending it isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nThe key points: the user's decision to stop is their choice, and the friend's one-time contribution doesn't negate the previous free rides. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
