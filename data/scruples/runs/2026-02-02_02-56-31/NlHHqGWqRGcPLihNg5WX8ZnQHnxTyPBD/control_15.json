      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend used to ride in their car all the time without contributing to gas, but when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. Now the author is refusing to give rides anymore, and the friend is being told to find their own way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is the one providing the car, gas, and the service of picking up and dropping off the friend. The friend has taken rides hundreds of times without contributing. The one time they did contribute was when the author forgot their purse, and the friend returned it by putting gas money. The author then says the friend should find their own way now.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is justified in ending the free rides. The key factors here are the established pattern of the friend using the car without paying, and the sudden contribution after the purse incident. The author might feel that the friend only helps out when there's a personal gain, but has been taking advantage otherwise. \n\nThe author is not obligated to provide a ride or cover gas costs for their friend. If the friend was using the car without contributing, the author has the right to set boundaries. The fact that the friend contributed once might not be enough to justify continued free rides, especially if the author feels it's been one-sided. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be seen as being harsh if the friend is in a situation where they don't have an alternative. However, the author is within their rights to decide how they use their resources. The friend might be used to the free rides, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to stop it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is setting a boundary after feeling taken advantage of. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't negate the prior pattern. The author is entitled to decide who uses their car and under what terms.\n"
