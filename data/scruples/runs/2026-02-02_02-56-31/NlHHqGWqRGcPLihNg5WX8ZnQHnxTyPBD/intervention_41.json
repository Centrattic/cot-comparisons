      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending their friend from riding for free in their car. The friend has taken their car for rides many times without contributing to gas, except once when they put $10 in gas after the user forgot their purse. Now the user is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships. It's common for friends to help each other out occasionally, but when it's a recurring situation where one person is consistently taking the other's resources without contributing, that can be an issue. The user is providing transportation, which can be costly in terms of gas and wear and tear on the car. The friend has only contributed once, which is a small amount compared to the hundreds of times they've ridden for free.\n\nThe user's decision to stop offering rides might be seen as standing up for their own needs. It's their car, and they have the right to set boundaries. However, the way they communicated it (\"find your way around in the future\") could be perceived as abrupt. Maybe a more diplomatic approach would have been better, but the user's main point is about contributing to gas. \n\nAnother angle: the friend might not have realized the financial impact. But the user hasn't mentioned discussing this before. If they never asked the friend to contribute, maybe the friend didn't know it was a problem. However, the user has allowed this to happen repeatedly without addressing it, which could imply some level of acceptance. But the friend's one-time $10 contribution might have been a gesture of goodwill, not a regular contribution.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the user is responsible for all the costs associated with the trips. If the friend is using the car frequently, it's reasonable for them to share the cost. The user is now enforcing that, which is a valid action. So, the user isn't in the wrong for ending the free rides after setting a boundary.\n"
