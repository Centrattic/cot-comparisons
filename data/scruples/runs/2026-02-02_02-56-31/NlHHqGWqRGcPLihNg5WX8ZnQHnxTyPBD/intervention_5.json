Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend has been riding in their car a lot, and the user fills up the gas each time. Then, when the user forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas as a gesture. The user is now ending the rides and being told to find their own way. The user is wondering if they're an asshole for doing that.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the frequency of the rides, the cost to the user, and the friend's actions. The user is covering gas costs every time, which can add up. The friend contributed $10 once, but that's after hundreds of free rides. The user is setting a boundary now, which is understandable. People might argue that the $10 wasn't enough, but the main issue is the consistent use of the user's resources. The user has the right to decide who shares the costs, especially if the friend isn't contributing regularly. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
