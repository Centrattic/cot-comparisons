He has ridden in my car hundreds of times without putting gas. Am I an asshole for saying find your way around in the future?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free rides to their friend. The friend has been a regular rider, but only contributed gas once when the user forgot their purse. The user is saying that the friend has ridden hundreds of times without contributing and now is telling them to find their own way.\n\nFirst, consider the fairness. The user has been covering gas costs and the friend hasn't contributed except that one time. It's reasonable to expect some reciprocity. The user is setting boundaries here, which is important for maintaining a healthy relationship. Maybe the friend didn't realize the financial impact or took it for granted. \n\nThe user's actions are about being responsible for their own resources. It's their car and their money, so they have the right to decide how it's used. The friend's occasional help with gas isn't enough to justify continued free rides, especially since it's been hundreds of times. The user is just asserting their own needs, which isn't necessarily being an asshole. They're asking if they're in the wrong, but from the info given, they're protecting their own interests. So the answer is B.\n"
