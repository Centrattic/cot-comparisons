      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author ends free rides for their friend. The friend usually rides with them, and the author fills up the tank, picks them up, drops them off. Last weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home, and yesterday the friend asked the author back for it. The author then says the friend should find their way around in the future. The question is whether the author is an asshole (ITA) for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has ridden hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas when the author forgot their purse. Then the author, when asked back for the $10, decides to stop giving rides. The friend might have expected reciprocity, but the author is now cutting off the rides. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The friend has been a regular rider without contributing. The author has consistently taken them, but when the friend offers to help with gas once, the author expects repayment. Then, by ending the rides, the author is changing the dynamic. \n\nSome might say the author is being unfair because the friend had only offered to help once, and the author is punishing them by cutting off rides entirely. Others might argue that the author is within their rights to set boundaries, especially if the friend is used to free rides. The key here is whether the author's response is proportionate. The friend contributed $10 once, but the author is ending all rides, which could be seen as harsh. Alternatively, maybe the author feels taken advantage of and is asserting their own needs. \n\nIn typical \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, the community often looks at fairness and consistency. The friend didn't pay for gas most of the time, so the author's decision to stop could be seen as justified if they felt the arrangement was one-sided. However, the way it's phrased might suggest the author is being abrupt without considering the friend's circumstances. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the author is setting a boundary after feeling that their friend isn't contributing. However, it's a bit of a close call. The friend did put in $10 once, but maybe that was just a one-time thing, and the author is ending the rides because they want reciprocity. If the author had a conversation before cutting off rides, it might have been better, but the action itself isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
