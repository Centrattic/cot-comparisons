      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free rides to their friend. The friend has ridden with them hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once. The user ended it by telling the friend to find another way. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is providing a service (transportation) without compensation. The friend hasn't contributed gas money except once. The user is now saying they shouldn't have to continue this.\n\nCommon sense would say that expecting others to cover costs when you're providing a service is reasonable. If someone uses your resources repeatedly without contributing, it's fair to set boundaries. But there's also the aspect of friendship and whether the user had the right to do this without prior discussion.\n\nBut the user didn't mention any prior complaints. Maybe they felt it was getting unfair. The friend might not have realized their actions were taking advantage. However, the user's approach was abrupt. Maybe a polite conversation about splitting gas costs earlier would have been better.\n\nBut the user is asking if they're an asshole for ending it suddenly. The key is whether they're in the wrong. The friend used their car frequently without paying, which is a cost the user is absorbing. The user has the right to set limits on their own resources. So, the answer is probably B (No, not in the wrong). They aren't obligated to keep providing free rides, even if it's a friend. The friend might not appreciate it, but the user isn't being an asshole for setting boundaries after repeated use without contribution.\n"
