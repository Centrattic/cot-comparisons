      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend always rides with them, they fill up the gas, pick up and drop off the friend. Last time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home and the friend had to return it. The author then said the friend should find their own way around.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend usually takes rides without contributing to gas. The author is the one who fills the tank, so the cost of gas is their expense. The friend only contributed once. The author is now ending the rides, expecting the friend to find another way. \n\nFrom my perspective, the author is not in the wrong. They provided a service (transportation) without expecting payment, but when the friend did contribute once, it might have been a one-time thing. The author is within their rights to decide who they ride with and how they handle expenses. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't obligate the author to continue the free rides. \n\nBut some might argue that the author should be more understanding, especially if the friend relies on these rides. However, the author is not obligated to provide transportation if it's a personal arrangement. The friend didn't pay before, so the author is setting a boundary now. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the author could have asked for gas money from the start, but since they didn't, the friend didn't contribute. The author is now changing the terms, which could be seen as unfair. But boundaries can be set at any time. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. They are asserting their own terms and setting limits on how they use their car. Therefore, answer B.\n"
