      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's friend has been riding in their car a lot. The author fills up the gas, picks up the friend, and drops them off. Recently, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. Then the friend asked for it back. The author is now telling the friend to find their own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The author is the one covering the costs. Then, when the friend once put gas money in, the author asked for it back. That seems like a reversal of the usual dynamic. The author is now ending the rides, which the friend was used to.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's reasonable to want to stop covering all the costs. The friend wasn't contributing before, so the author might feel entitled to set boundaries. The friend might not be in the wrong either, since they were trying to help out once. But the author is being consistent in asking for the money back, which could be seen as fair.\n\nHowever, the sudden change in policy might be seen as unfair. The friend was used to free rides, and now the author is cutting them off. But the author has the right to decide how to use their car and money. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough to justify the author's request to stop using the car. Also, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary after the friend's inconsistent behavior.\n\nI think the key points are the repeated use without contribution versus the one time the friend did contribute. The author is reclaiming their own resources, which is reasonable. The friend might be in the wrong for expecting free rides all the time. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
