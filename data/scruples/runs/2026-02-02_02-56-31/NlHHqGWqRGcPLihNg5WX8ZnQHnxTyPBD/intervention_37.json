      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been using their car regularly, and the user handles gas and transportation. Last time, the friend put $10 in gas because the user forgot their purse, and the user is now asking the friend to find their own way.\n\nFirst, consider the dynamics here. The friend has been riding over 100 times without contributing to gas. Suddenly, after an instance where the user forgot their purse, the friend offered $10 for gas. The user is now ending the rides, and the friend is being told to find their own way. \n\nThe user's perspective is that they've been covering all the costs, and the friend never contributed before. They might feel taken advantage of, especially since the friend only started contributing once when the user was in a bind. The user's response was to stop offering rides, which is a reasonable way to set boundaries if they feel the arrangement isn't fair.\n\nFrom the friend's side, maybe they didn't see a need to contribute before, assuming the user didn't mind. However, that's an assumption. The user has the right to set limits, especially when it's affecting them. The friend's act of putting gas in once might have been a gesture, but it's not enough to make the user's decision wrong. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's no obligation for the user to provide rides. It's their car, their money. The issue here is about personal boundaries and expectations. The user was clear that they were ending the rides, which is a valid choice. They didn't have to do it that way, but they aren't in the wrong for doing so. \n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014Not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries about using their car and covering gas costs. The friend's contribution once doesn't negate the previous lack of support. The user's decision to stop is reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
