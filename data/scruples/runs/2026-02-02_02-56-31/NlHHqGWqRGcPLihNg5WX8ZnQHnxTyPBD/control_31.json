      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The scenario is that the friend always rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas. This time, the friend put in $10 for gas because the author forgot their purse, and then later the friend asked for it back. The author then said that the friend should find their way around in the future. The user wants to know if the author is an asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The main points are: the friend frequently rides in the author's car without contributing to gas, except this one time when they did put in $10. The author forgot their purse, so maybe the $10 was a way to return it indirectly. Then the friend asked for it back, and the author decided to stop offering rides.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, the friend has been using the author's car without contributing, which might be an imbalance. However, the friend did make a one-time contribution here. But the author's response is to stop offering rides, which could be seen as cutting off a long-standing favor without considering the friend's possible needs or transportation options.\n\nBut wait, the friend might not have other means to get around. If the author suddenly stops, the friend might be left without transportation. That could be harsh if the friend relies on it. However, the author is not obligated to provide rides continuously if they feel it's unfair. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't necessarily mean they should continue contributing regularly. The author might feel that the friend isn't contributing to the shared cost of gas, which is a reasonable concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have addressed it by asking the friend to contribute occasionally rather than ending the rides altogether. Maybe the friend didn't realize the cost impact and the author could have set boundaries earlier. But in this case, the author is reacting after a single instance where the friend did contribute, and then asked for the money back, which seems odd. The friend's actions might have been a way to return the purse, not a genuine contribution. So the author's decision to stop might be justified because the friend's behavior here is inconsistent with their past actions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after feeling used, especially when the friend's contribution was a one-off and then they asked for it back. The answer would be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
