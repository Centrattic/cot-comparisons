      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been riding in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but this one time, the author forgot their purse at home, so the friend put $10 in gas. Then the author says the friend should find their own way around now.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend has been getting free rides consistently, which the author has been covering all the gas costs. The friend only contributed once when the author forgot their purse. The author then ends the arrangement, asking the friend to find their own way. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend wasn't contributing anything before, so the author is choosing to no longer subsidize the rides. The friend's one-time contribution of $10 doesn't seem like a pattern of helping. The author's request is about fairness\u2014expecting some contribution or responsibility from the friend. \n\nIn many situations, people might expect some reciprocity when sharing resources like gas. If the friend hasn't contributed before, the author is within their rights to set boundaries. The friend might see this as unfair, but the author isn't obligated to keep covering all costs. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're setting a boundary after a pattern of one-sided benefit. The friend's single act of giving gas doesn't negate the prior behavior. The author has the right to decide who they give rides to and under what conditions.\n"
