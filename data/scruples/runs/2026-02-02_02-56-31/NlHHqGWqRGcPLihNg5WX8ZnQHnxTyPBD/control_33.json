      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend always rides with them, the author fills up the gas, picks up and drops off the friend. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. Then the friend asked for the money back, and the author told them to find their own way.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend has used the car many times without contributing to gas, but this time they put in $10. Then they asked for it back. The author decided to stop giving rides. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. If the rides were always free, the friend might not have expected to pay. But the author started filling the tank, which might imply that the friend should contribute. But in this case, the friend did put in $10, maybe expecting that to cover their share. However, they then asked for it back, which seems contradictory. \n\nThe author's response was to end the rides. Is that justified? Well, if the friend is using the car frequently without contributing, the author might feel they're being taken advantage of. But when the friend did contribute $10 and then wanted it back, that could be seen as the friend not being serious about covering their share. The author's decision to stop the rides in that context might be seen as reasonable because the friend didn't follow through properly. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of cutting off rides entirely, they could have discussed expectations. However, the friend's actions (putting in money and then asking for it back) might have pushed the author to their breaking point. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the friend has never paid before, it's a one-time payment, and then they expect to get it back, that's not fair. The author is within their rights to decide not to continue the rides if they feel their friend isn't respecting their contributions. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong because they're setting boundaries after being taken advantage of.\n"
