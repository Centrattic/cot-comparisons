I fill up the tank and pick him up at his house and drop him back off safely at home. This past weekend he put 10 in gas because I forgot my purse home and yesterday he asked me back for it. He has ridden in my car hundreds of times without putting gas. Am I an asshole for saying find your way around in the future?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has ridden in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once. The user said to find their own way now.\n\nSo, the main point here is about fairness and expectations. The user has been providing a service (rides) without compensation. The friend never helped with gas except once. When the user forgot their purse, the friend put in $10 for gas. But the user is now ending the rides.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, it's their car and their choice. They can decide who rides with them and under what conditions. The friend wasn't forced to help with gas before, so the user isn't obligated to let them ride for free indefinitely. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough, but the user is setting a boundary now. \n\nHowever, maybe the user should have communicated earlier about contributing to gas. But since they let it go for hundreds of times, maybe the expectation was free rides. But the user has the right to change their mind. So, the answer would be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
