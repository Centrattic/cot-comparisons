      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for ending free rides. Let's read the situation again. The user (AITA) has a friend who rides in their car everywhere. They fill up the gas, pick up the friend, and drop them off. Last weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the user forgot their purse at home. Then the friend asked for it back, and the user said to find their own way around. The question is whether the user is an asshole.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The friend has ridden in the user's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put in $10 because the user forgot their purse. The user then decided to stop giving rides. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending the free rides.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about fairness and reciprocity. The user has been allowing the friend to ride for free, which might be seen as a kindness. But the friend hasn't contributed to the gas costs. However, in this instance, the friend did put $10 in gas when the user forgot their purse. Then the friend asked for the $10 back, and the user said to find their own way.\n\nI need to consider if the user is overstepping by ending the rides. The user might feel that the friend has been taking advantage by not contributing to gas costs, except once. The friend's request for the $10 back might be a way to cover the previous cost, but the user is now ending the arrangement. \n\nFrom the user's perspective, maybe they feel that the friend should contribute to gas costs, and since they only did once, the user is ending the rides. Alternatively, the user might be setting boundaries after realizing that the friend hasn't contributed much. \n\nBut the friend might argue that they were just helping out when the user forgot the purse, and the user is now punishing them for past behavior. However, the user's action is about their own convenience and not wanting to continue covering gas costs for the friend. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? If the user was okay with the friend riding without paying gas before, then maybe they aren't in the wrong now. The friend did contribute once, but maybe that's not enough. The user might have a right to change their mind about the arrangement. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user didn't have a prior agreement about gas payments, the friend might not be in the wrong for not paying. But the user is now ending the rides, which is their choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're setting boundaries after a situation where they had to ask for the money back. It's about personal boundaries and fairness. The answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
