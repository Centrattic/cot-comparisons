      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended their free friend rides is in the wrong. The scenario is that their friend regularly uses their car without contributing to gas, except once when the friend added $10 after the user forgot their purse. The user then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The user is providing a service (car rides) without compensation, which the friend has been using frequently. The friend's one-time contribution of $10 might not be enough to balance the ongoing cost, especially since gas prices can add up. The user is within their rights to expect some contribution, especially if the rides are frequent. \n\nHowever, the user's response of telling the friend to \"find your way around in the future\" could be seen as cutting off a long-standing favor. The question is whether the user's action was justified. The friend's past behavior of not contributing to gas except once might have been a pattern, so the user's decision to stop could be a reasonable boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user could have addressed the issue earlier or negotiated a more gradual change instead of an abrupt end. But the friend's occasional contribution might not have been consistent enough to justify continued free rides. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the user is standing up for their own resources and setting a boundary. Friends should ideally communicate about such things, and if the user felt taken advantage of, ending the arrangement makes sense. The friend's one-time payment might not have been sufficient for the user to feel appreciated, leading to the decision. \n\nSo, the user isn't wrong for setting a boundary after repeated use without contribution. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
