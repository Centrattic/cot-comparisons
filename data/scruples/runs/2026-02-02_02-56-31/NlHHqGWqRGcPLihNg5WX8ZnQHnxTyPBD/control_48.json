      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend always rides in their car, the author fills up the gas, picks them up and drops them off. Then one time, the friend put $10 in gas when the author forgot their purse. The author then says the friend should find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The one time they did contribute was when the author forgot their purse. Then the author ended the rides. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing that.\n\nSo, the main issue here is fairness and reciprocity. The author is providing a service (rides) that incurs costs (gas, time, wear and tear on the car). The friend has been using this service without contributing, except once when they put in $10. The author is now asking the friend to find their own way, which is their way of ending the arrangement without reciprocity.\n\nBut wait, the friend only contributed once. The author is ending it because of that one instance. Is that fair? The friend has been riding for hundreds of times without paying, so maybe the author is just correcting the imbalance. On the other hand, the friend did contribute once, maybe trying to be helpful, but the author is still cutting them off. \n\nThe author might feel that their generosity is being taken for granted. The friend might have assumed that occasional contributions are enough, but the author expects consistent reciprocity. Alternatively, maybe the author is being too harsh because the friend did contribute at least once. \n\nBut considering the cost over hundreds of rides, $10 is negligible. The author is probably tired of the one-sided arrangement. Ending the rides could be seen as the author setting a boundary, which is reasonable. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't make up for the ongoing costs. So, the author isn't in the wrong for deciding to stop providing free rides. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
