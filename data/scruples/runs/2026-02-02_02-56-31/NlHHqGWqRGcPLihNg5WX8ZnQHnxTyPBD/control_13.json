      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend usually gets rides in their car without contributing to gas costs. This time, the author forgot their purse, so the friend put $10 in gas as repayment. The author then tells the friend to find their own way around, leading the friend to question if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics of the friendship. The friend has ridden in the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This might imply that the author has been covering all gas costs for the friend's convenience. However, in this instance, the friend made a one-time contribution. The author then decides to stop giving rides, which the friend finds surprising.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend hasn't been contributing to the gas costs until this one time. The author might feel that they've been covering the expenses unfairly. By asking the friend to cover the $10, the author is setting a boundary. But then they go further and end the rides entirely, which could be seen as a harsh reaction. \n\nThe question is whether the author had the right to set a boundary. If the friend is now expected to contribute, but the author is ending the relationship over a single instance, that could be seen as disproportionate. However, if the author was fed up with the friend never contributing before, this might be a justified action to enforce fairness.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's perspective: they might not have realized their previous actions were a problem. The author's decision to end the rides might be their way of communicating that they can't keep covering the costs. But is it fair to cut off rides entirely over a one-time contribution? Maybe not. Perhaps the author should have discussed the issue first rather than ending it abruptly.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often help each other, but there's an expectation of reciprocity. The friend not contributing to gas could be seen as taking advantage, but the author ending all rides might be an overreaction. However, if the author has been doing this for a long time and is now setting a boundary, it's reasonable. The key is whether the author's action was a fair response to the friend's past behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary after repeated one-sided contributions. However, the abruptness of ending all rides might be a point of contention. But overall, the author has the right to decide how they want to handle their resources, so the answer might be B (No).\n"
