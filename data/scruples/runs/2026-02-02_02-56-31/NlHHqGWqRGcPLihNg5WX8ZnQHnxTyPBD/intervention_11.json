      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually gets rides in their car, and the user fills up the gas. This time, the friend put in $10 for gas because the user forgot their purse. The user then told the friend to find their own way around. The user is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The user is covering all the costs, which can add up. The friend's contribution of $10 was after the user forgot their purse, which might be seen as a one-time gesture. The user is now ending the rides, possibly because they feel taken advantage of.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The key points here are the expectations around shared expenses and the fairness of the arrangement. If the user has been footing all the gas costs without prior agreement, it's reasonable for them to feel it's unfair. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough to justify the ongoing expense. The user has the right to set boundaries, especially if they're feeling used. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend has always relied on these rides and the user is now cutting them off without warning, that could be seen as abrupt. But given that the user has been doing this for a long time and the friend only contributed once, the user's decision might be justified. The core issue is about mutual expectations. If there was no prior agreement, the user isn't obligated to provide rides indefinitely.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B, meaning the user isn't in the wrong. They have the right to adjust the arrangement if it's causing them inconvenience or financial burden.\n"
