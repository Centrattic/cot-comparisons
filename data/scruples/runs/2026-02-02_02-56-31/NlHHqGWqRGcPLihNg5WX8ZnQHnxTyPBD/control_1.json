      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the author's friend often rides in their car, and the author covers all the gas costs. Recently, the friend put $10 in gas when the author forgot their purse and asked for it back. Now the author is saying the friend should find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The author provided rides consistently, but now they're ending it. The friend did contribute $10 once, but the author is asking if it's wrong to expect them to handle transportation from now on.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author isn't obligated to provide rides. They can set boundaries. The friend used the car many times without paying, which might be seen as taking advantage. The author is now asking the friend to find their own way, which is a reasonable request. However, the fact that the author is ending the rides suddenly might be seen as abrupt, especially if the friend relied on them. But the friend has contributed once, which the author is returning, so maybe that's a gesture of goodwill.\n\nIn terms of the rules of such situations, people can choose to end favors they previously offered. Unless there was an explicit agreement, the friend might not have had a right to the rides. The author isn't being unreasonable by stopping, especially since the friend didn't contribute before. The $10 incident might not be a big point since it's just a one-time contribution.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to stop providing the service. The answer should be B.\n"
