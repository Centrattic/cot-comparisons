      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended free rides for their friend was in the wrong. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put $10 in gas. The author then tells the friend to find their own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA) for doing this.\n\nFirst, consider the key points. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without paying for gas. The one time they did contribute was after the author forgot their purse. The author is now ending the free rides. The friend's contribution was minimal compared to the hundreds of times they didn't contribute. \n\nI need to evaluate fairness here. The friend's action of putting $10 in gas was a one-time thing, possibly just as a gesture or out of guilt. The author is asking if it's wrong to stop allowing free rides after that. The friend might not have any obligation to pay for gas, but the author is their friend and has been accommodating. However, the author has the right to set boundaries. The friend's behavior might be seen as taking advantage, especially since they didn't contribute most of the time. The author's response is a reasonable boundary to prevent being taken advantage of. \n\nAlso, consider if the author's reaction is proportionate. The friend did contribute once, but the author is ending all rides. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss it, but ending the rides isn't necessarily wrong. The author is not obligated to keep allowing free rides. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
