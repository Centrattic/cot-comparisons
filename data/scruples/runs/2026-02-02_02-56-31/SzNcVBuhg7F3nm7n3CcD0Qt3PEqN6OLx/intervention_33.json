  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for accidentally making my daughter believe her uncle's brightly colored vegan cake was Play-doh and causing the entire family to do arts and crafts with it instead of eating it?\nAt a family Christmas brunch my brother had done his absolute best preparing a vegan dessert for the family. He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the brother put a lot of effort into making a vegan cake. The user called it Play-Doh, which probably wasn't respectful. Even if the cake looked like Play-Doh, the brother was proud of his creation. The user's comment led to the family treating it as a toy, which ruined the uncle's effort. \n\nThe daughter was just four and innocent, but the user's action started the whole thing. The uncle might feel disrespected, even if it wasn't intentional. The user admitted they felt guilty. So, even though the user wasn't mean, they did cause unintended harm. \n\nRespecting others' efforts is important. Even if the user was joking, it affected the uncle's feelings. So, maybe they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
