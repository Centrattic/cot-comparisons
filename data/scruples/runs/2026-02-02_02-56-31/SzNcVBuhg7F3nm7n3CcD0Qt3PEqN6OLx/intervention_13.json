He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a vegan cake for Christmas brunch, which is a special occasion. The user, knowing their brother's dietary choices, has a history of teasing him but claims they've been more respectful lately. The incident happened when the daughter asked what the cake was, and the user jokingly said it was Play-Doh. The daughter then started playing with it, and the whole family joined in, which upset the brother.\n\nNow, evaluating if they're in the wrong. The key points here are intent and the impact. The user didn't mean to harm, but their joke led to the brother's creation being treated as a toy. The brother was proud of his dessert, so having it ruined might have been disappointing. The user admits to feeling guilty about the fun they had at the brother's expense.\n\nFactors to consider: Was the joke malicious? The user says they've been respectful lately, so maybe the joke was meant as light-hearted. However, the brother might have felt disrespected or his effort wasn't appreciated. Also, the daughter was young and innocent, so the user's comment influenced her actions. The family's reaction was playful, but it did ruin the brother's contribution to the meal.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user's comment was the catalyst. Even if it was a joke, they should have been more mindful of their brother's feelings and the effort he put in. The fact that they feel guilty suggests they recognize the impact. So, while the intention wasn't to be harmful, the action still caused disappointment. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not considering the consequences of their joke on their brother's feelings and the event's purpose.\n"
