He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to use it as craft material instead of eating it. The story says the brother was proud of his dessert, which was a bright green mung bean cake. The user joked it looked like Play-Doh, the kid took it seriously, and the whole family ended up playing with it. The brother wasn't amused, and the user feels guilty.\n\nSo, I need to decide if the user is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are intent and impact. The user's intention was probably a joke, but the result was the brother's effort being wasted and the family not eating his dish. The brother might have put a lot of time into making the cake, and the user's comment caused others not to eat it. The user says they've been cool with the brother's veganism lately, but this incident might have undermined that. Also, the brother was proud of his creation, so the user's joke might have been disrespectful, even if accidental.\n\nChildren can't be blamed for not knowing, but the parent's role is to guide them. The user's quick comment led the child to treat the cake as Play-Doh, which then spread to the whole family. While the user might have thought it was a harmless joke, the consequence was that the brother's effort was wasted. The user is the parent, so they should have considered the feelings of their brother and made sure the child didn't mistake the cake. Even if it was a joke, the parent's responsibility is to prevent such a situation, especially when a family member's effort is involved. So, the user might be at fault for not foreseeing the outcome of their comment and for not correcting their daughter's mistake immediately. Therefore, the answer would be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
