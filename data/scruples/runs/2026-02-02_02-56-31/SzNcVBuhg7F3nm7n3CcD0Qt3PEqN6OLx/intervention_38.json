He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh. The situation is that the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh, and the parent joked that it was, leading the kids and family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset because he took pride in his creation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The parent was teasing their brother, maybe trying to be funny. But the joke led to the brother's dish being ruined. The brother put effort into making the cake, and the family's reaction might have been hurtful. The parent acknowledges feeling guilty, which is a red flag.\n\nThen, the daughter was just a child, so she didn't mean any harm. But the parent initiated the joke. Family gatherings can be tricky, and while humor is okay, it's important not to make others feel disrespected. The brother's veganism was already a point of previous teasing, even though the parent claims to be cool with it now. The joke crossed a line by undermining his effort in front of the family.\n\nAlso, the parent enjoyed the joke, which shows they might have known it wasn't the best idea. The brother's disappointment is valid because he was proud of his creation. The fact that the cake was ruined because of the joke adds to the problem. The parent's actions led to the brother's dish not being eaten, which could be seen as dismissive of his effort.\n\nBut maybe the parent thought it was harmless fun. However, considering that the brother was earnest about his veganism and took time to prepare, the joke wasn't respectful. The parent's previous teasing might have made the brother more sensitive. Even if the parent meant no harm, the outcome was negative for the brother. So, the parent is in the wrong for not considering the brother's feelings and the effort put into the dessert.\n"
