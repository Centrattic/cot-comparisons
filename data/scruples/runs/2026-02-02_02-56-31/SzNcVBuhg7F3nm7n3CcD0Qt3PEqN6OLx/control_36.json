He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh. The situation is a family Christmas brunch where the brother made a green mung bean cake. The author, who has a history of giving the brother a hard time about his veganism, jokingly told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The whole family ended up playing with it instead of eating, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider intent. The author didn't mean to be malicious but made a joke. However, their actions led to the brother's creation being treated as a toy, which he found amusing. The key factors here are whether the author intended harm and whether their actions were respectful.\n\nThe author mentions that they respect their brother's dietary choices now, but their joke might have undermined that respect. Even if it was a joke, it's possible that it caused embarrassment. The brother was \"not too amused,\" so the author's actions had a negative impact, even if unintended. \n\nChildren don't understand the implications of such a joke, so the daughter's innocent question led to the author's offhand comment. The family then joined in, which might have been fun for them but ruined the brother's effort. The author feels guilty for enjoying the situation, which suggests they recognize that their actions weren't entirely appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother's cake was a vegan dessert, and maybe the author's comment was meant as a light-hearted joke. However, the fact that the family used the cake as Play-Doh instead of eating it could be seen as dismissing the brother's effort. The key here is the respect for the brother's effort and the impact on his feelings.\n\nIn family dynamics, humor is subjective. But if it leads to someone else's effort being trivialized, it might cross a line. The author's comment led to a situation where the brother's contribution was not respected. Even if it was a joke, the outcome affected the brother's experience negatively.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because their action, although not malicious, resulted in disrespecting the brother's effort. They should have considered how their joke might affect the brother and avoided making a comment that led the family to misuse the dessert.\n"
