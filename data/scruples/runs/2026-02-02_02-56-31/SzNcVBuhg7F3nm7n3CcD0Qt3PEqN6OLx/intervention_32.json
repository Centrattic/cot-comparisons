He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which the user found amusing because it looked like Play-Doh. The user's daughter asked what it was, and they jokingly said it was Play-Doh. This led to the family playing with the dessert, which upset the brother.\n\nThe user mentions they've given their brother a hard time about his veganism before but have been more respectful lately. Now they feel guilty for the fun they had at their brother's expense.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent and impact. The user didn't mean to ruin the brunch, but their comment led to the family not eating the dessert as intended. The brother was proud of his creation, and the joke backfired, making the event awkward.\n\nEven though it might have been a joke, the user's comment directly caused the misunderstanding. The daughter was innocent, but the parent's reaction set off the chain of events. The brother's efforts were disrespected, even if unintentionally. The user should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort he put in, especially in front of family. The fun the user had was at the expense of others' feelings. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user initiated the joke, so they share the blame. The brother's veganism was a personal choice, and while the user has a history of teasing, they claimed to have been more respectful. This incident might have undermined that respect. The family's actions, though playful, didn't consider the creator's intentions and effort.\n\nTherefore, even if it was a mistake, the user's role in starting the joke and not stopping the family's actions when they saw the brother's displeasure makes them at least partially responsible. They should apologize to the brother and take responsibility for the impact of their comment.\n"
