He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother made a vegan cake, which looked and smelled like Play-Doh. The parent joked that it was Play-Doh, leading the kids and others to play with it. The brother was upset because his effort was wasted. The parent feels guilty for the fun they had at the brother's expense.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? Well, the brother put in effort to make a special dessert, possibly to share his vegan lifestyle. The parent's joke might have been inconsiderate, even if it was a mistake. The daughter is a child, so her question is innocent, but the parent's response led to the family not respecting the effort. However, the parent mentioned they've been cool with the brother's veganism lately, so maybe they didn't mean to mock. Still, the outcome was the brother's dish being treated as a toy. The parent might have overstepped, even if unintentionally. The key points are intent vs. impact. The parent didn't mean to insult, but the impact was hurtful. In such cases, being inconsiderate of someone's effort could be seen as wrong. The parent should have clarified it was food or discouraged the kids from playing with it. So, probably A, they're in the wrong.\n"
