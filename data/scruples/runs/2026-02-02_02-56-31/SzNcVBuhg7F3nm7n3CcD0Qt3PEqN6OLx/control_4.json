He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-doh, leading everyone to use it for arts and crafts instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty, especially since they had been respecting the brother's vegan choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The brother put effort into making a special dessert, which was vegan. The author made a joke that led the family to treat it as playdough. The author had a history of teasing the brother about his veganism but has been trying to be more respectful. Now, they feel guilty for ruining the brunch.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The brother's intention was to serve a dessert, and the author's comment disrupted that. Even if the author meant it as a joke, it resulted in the dessert not being eaten and the brother being upset. The author's daughter was young and didn't understand, but the author knew the context. They could have explained it was a dessert but chose not to. The author's history of teasing might contribute to this incident, even if they've been better lately. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the brother should have presented the cake differently. But the author's action directly caused the problem. They had the opportunity to correct the misunderstanding but didn't. The guilt comes from the fact that the brother's effort was wasted and he felt disrespected. Even if the family had fun, the brother's feelings were hurt. The author's responsibility here is to prevent such a situation, especially knowing the brother's pride in his creation. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). They should have clarified the cake wasn't playdough to avoid disrespecting their brother's efforts, despite the intention being a joke. The result was harmful to the brother's feelings and the family event.\n"
