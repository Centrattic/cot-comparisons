He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother made a vegan cake, which the author found looked and smelled like Play-Doh. The daughter asked what it was, and the author said it was Play-Doh. The daughter then started playing with it, and the family joined in. The brother was upset because his dessert was ruined. The author feels guilty about having fun at their brother's expense.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are intent and consequences. The author didn't mean to ruin the cake on purpose, but they did make a joke that led to the family not eating it. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions probably hurt his feelings. Even though it was a joke, the author's comment was the catalyst for the whole thing. They should have realized that calling it Play-Doh might lead to the kids playing with it, and maybe others joining in. The author admits to having fun making fun of their brother's cake, which adds guilt. \n\nHowever, the author claims they've been respectful of their brother's veganism lately. Maybe they thought it was a harmless joke. But the consequence was that the brother's effort was wasted, and the family's meal was disrupted. The daughter was young, so she didn't understand the context. The author's responsibility here might be in not thinking through how their comment would affect the brother's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the brother should have prepared something that was more obviously edible. But that's not the main point. The main issue is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since it was an accident, but the author's comment directly caused the confusion, leading to the brother's dessert being ruined, they might be in the wrong. The author also admits to feeling guilty, which suggests they recognize the mistake. \n\nSo, considering the intent was not malicious but the action led to a negative outcome, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should have foreseen the consequence and acted more responsibly. Alternatively, if the joke was just a momentary lapse and not meant to harm, maybe B (No). But typically, if someone's actions, even if unintentional, cause harm, they might be considered at fault. The author's guilt also points towards them acknowledging the wrong.\n"
