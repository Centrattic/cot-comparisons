He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent here. The person says they've been giving their brother a hard time about his veganism in the past but have been more respectful lately. However, in this situation, they joked and told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The brother was proud of his creation, and this led to the family not eating it, which upset him.\n\nOn one hand, the person might argue that it was an innocent joke, especially with a young child involved. Kids often mistake things for toys, and maybe they didn't mean to humiliate the brother. But on the other hand, the brother had put effort into making the cake for the family meal, and the joke backfired, ruining his pride and the purpose of the dessert. \n\nAlso, using a child to perpetuate the joke might be seen as taking advantage of her innocence. Even if it was accidental, the parent's reaction could be seen as mocking the brother's efforts. The brother might feel disrespected, especially if others joined in, making it a family-wide mockery. \n\nBut maybe the family had a good time, and the brother was just upset. It's possible that the person didn't intend to be mean, so they might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of malicious intent. However, they should still feel guilty because their actions had unintended negative consequences on their brother's feelings. \n\nIn terms of social norms, teasing about someone's hobbies or efforts can be sensitive. Even if well-meaning, if it causes hurt, it's better to apologize. So the person might be in the wrong for not considering how their joke affected their brother. \n\nHmm. So considering all that, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't think about the brother's feelings, but maybe B (not in the wrong) if it was a genuine accident. But the fact that they had a history of giving the brother a hard time might tip it towards A. The key point is whether the action was malicious or not. The user admitted to feeling guilty, which suggests they think they're in the wrong. But the question is whether they actually are. \n\nI think the answer is A because even if it was a joke, using a child to play a trick on a family member's effort could be seen as crossing a line. The brother's feelings were hurt, and the person didn't consider the impact, even if unintentional. So the answer is A.\n"
