He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the context: The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, despite usually being cool with the brother's veganism, jokingly called it Play-Doh in front of their daughter. The daughter then started playing with it, and the whole family joined in, which upset the brother and ruined his dessert.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's intention was likely a joke, but the daughter took it literally. The uncle took pride in his creation, and the family's actions led to the dessert not being eaten. The author feels guilty about the fun they had at the uncle's expense.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the uncle was proud of his dessert, which was a thoughtful gesture. The family's actions, even if meant as a joke, disrespected his effort. The uncle might have felt embarrassed or disrespected. The author's comment, while possibly innocent, led to unintended consequences. Even if the author didn't mean to be mean, the result was that the uncle's effort was wasted. However, the situation was a family gathering, and maybe some humor is expected. But since the uncle was proud, and the dessert was a special effort, the author's joke crossed a line by undermining that effort. The author should have been more mindful of the uncle's feelings and the significance of his preparation. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
