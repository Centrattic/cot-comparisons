He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let's start by summarizing the situation. The user's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-doh. The user told their daughter it was Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the user feels guilty about having fun at their brother's expense.\n\nFirst, I should consider the intentions. The user didn't mean to be mean, just saw a similarity to Play-doh and joked about it. But the daughter took it literally, and others joined in. The brother was proud of his creation, so having it treated as a toy instead of food would be hurtful. Even if the user didn't intend to disrespect, the outcome affected the brother's feelings and the meal's purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, the user mentions they've been respectful of the brother's dietary choices lately. They didn't mock the veganism itself but the appearance of the cake. However, the family's actions ruined the dessert, which the brother had put effort into. The user's guilt suggests they see a problem.\n\nPossible angles: Was the user's comment a harmless joke that got out of hand, or was it a failure to respect their brother's effort? The daughter is four, so she's innocent, but the adults should have known better. The user, as a parent, might share responsibility for not preventing the situation.\n\nAlso, the brother's pride in his creation being undermined could be a factor. Even if the cake looked like Play-doh, the user's comment led to a family-wide joke at the brother's expense. It's possible that the user didn't consider how their joke might affect their brother's feelings.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the user did make the initial comment that started the chain reaction. While they didn't intend to be cruel, their action directly caused the problem. So, they might be in the wrong for not thinking about the consequences and for not stopping the family from playing with the cake once they realized the brother was upset.\n\nBut others might argue that it was an innocent mistake, especially with a young child involved. The user did feel guilty afterward, which shows they care. The brother's upset could be seen as hypersensitive. However, the effort and pride in the brother's creation are valid, and the family's actions dismissed that.\n\nI think the key points are the user's role in initiating the misunderstanding and the impact on the brother's feelings. Even if unintentional, the user's comment led to a situation where the brother's effort was wasted. So, they might be in the wrong.\n"
