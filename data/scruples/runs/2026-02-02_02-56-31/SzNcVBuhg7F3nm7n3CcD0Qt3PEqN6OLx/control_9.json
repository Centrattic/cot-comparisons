He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh and leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The brother put effort into making a vegan cake, and the author, instead of eating it, joked that it looked like Play-Doh. The daughter took the bait and started playing with it, leading the whole family to join in. The brother was upset because his dessert was ruined.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made a joke that led to the family not eating the cake, which the brother was proud of. The author acknowledges that they gave their brother a hard time about his veganism in the past but have been respectful lately. Now, they feel guilty because the brother wasn't amused, and the brunch's vegan addition was ruined.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the brother made the cake with the intention for it to be eaten. The author's joke led to it being used as a toy, which the brother didn't like. Even though it was a joke, the author's actions directly caused the brother's creation to be wasted. The author admits to feeling guilty, which suggests they realize there's a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, it was a family gathering, and maybe some humor is expected. But the brother's feelings and effort should be respected. The author's comment was the catalyst for the whole family not eating the cake, which might be considered disrespecting the brother's effort. Also, the daughter is young, so maybe the author shouldn't have joked in a way that encouraged her to play with the food, especially when it was someone else's special dish.\n\nSo, considering the brother's feelings and the effort he put into making the cake, the author's actions were inappropriate. They should have been more considerate and not made the joke that led to the cake being wasted. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
