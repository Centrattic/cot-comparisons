He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother put effort into making a vegan cake, which was part of a family brunch. The user made a joke about it looking like Play-Doh, which led the kids and others to play with it. The brother was upset because it ruined his creation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: intention, context, and consequences. The user says they couldn't help it because the cake looked like Play-Doh. They've been giving the brother a hard time about veganism before but have been respecting it lately. The daughter's innocent question triggered the comment, which led to the whole family playing with it. The brother was not amused, and the dessert was ruined.\n\nNow, considering the user's perspective: they might think it's a funny misunderstanding, a harmless joke. But the brother put effort into making a special dessert for the family, and the user's comment undermined that. The brother's feelings are hurt because his creation was treated as a toy, not food. The user also mentions feeling guilty about having fun at their brother's expense.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue that it was an accident, they didn't mean to hurt anyone, and it was a moment of humor. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The brother's pride and effort in making the dessert are important. The user's comment led to the family not respecting the intended purpose of the dessert. Even if it was accidental, the result was that the brother's effort was wasted.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age, she might not understand the context of the joke, so it's the parent's responsibility to not set up situations where food is mistaken for a toy, especially when it's someone else's special effort. The user's role as a parent here might be part of the issue\u2014they introduced a false premise that led the child to interact with the food inappropriately.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered respectful to eat the food that someone has prepared, especially if they're proud of it. Making a joke that leads others to not eat it could be seen as dismissive of the preparer's efforts. Even if the user didn't intend to be mean, the outcome was that the brother's dessert wasn't used as intended, which can be hurtful.\n\nHowever, the user did mention that they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices recently, so this might be an honest mistake. The key here is whether the user's actions were intentionally disrespectful or just an accident. The user says they \"blurted out\" the comment without thinking, so it might not have been malicious. But the consequence was still negative for the brother.\n\nIn conclusion, even if it was an accident, the user is in the wrong because their action led to the family not respecting the brother's creation. They should consider apologizing and acknowledging that their joke, while maybe unintended, still hurt their brother's feelings and wasted his effort.\n"
