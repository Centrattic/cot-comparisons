He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the context: the brother made a vegan cake, which the author compared to Play-Doh. The daughter then started treating it like Play-Doh, and the family joined in. The brother was upset because his dessert wasn't eaten.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent and impact. The author didn't mean to insult the brother, but their comment led to the family not eating his creation. The brother was proud of his dessert, which is his personal choice (veganism). The author's joke might have been harmless, but the consequence was that the brother's effort was wasted, and he was upset.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author's action was a joke, but it resulted in the family not consuming the dessert. The brother had the right to be proud of his creation, and the author's comment undermined that. Even though the author didn't intend to be mean, the outcome still affected the brother negatively. The author might have a responsibility to consider how their comments affect others, especially when it's a family gathering and someone's effort is involved.\n\nAlso, the daughter was young, so the author might not have foreseen the chain reaction. However, as a parent, they might be expected to be more cautious with their words around children. The author's laughter and participation in the joke could have influenced the daughter's actions.\n\nIn terms of respect, even if the author respects the brother's dietary choices, the joke played on the brother's effort and possibly mocked his choice. The brother was beaming with pride, so the comment was a direct jab at his creation, even if unintentional.\n\nSo, while the author didn't have malicious intent, the action did cause harm to the brother's feelings and the family event. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong for not considering the consequences of their words on the brother's feelings and the family dynamic.\n"
