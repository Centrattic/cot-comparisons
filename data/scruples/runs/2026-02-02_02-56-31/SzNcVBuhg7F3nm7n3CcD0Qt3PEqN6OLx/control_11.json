He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother made a vegan dessert, which is a personal choice and effort. The author, who usually jokes about the brother's veganism but has been more respectful lately, said the cake looked like Play-Doh. The daughter then started playing with it, and the family joined in. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty about enjoying the joke.\n\nSo, the main points are: The author's comment was accidental, the daughter's action was innocent, the family's reaction was playful. The brother's feelings were hurt because his creation wasn't respected as food. The author might be in the wrong because they made a joke that led to disrespecting the brother's effort. But since the comment was impulsive and not intentional to cause harm, maybe not. \n\nVeganism is a personal choice, and the brother was proud of his dessert. The author's past teasing might have made it more likely for them to make that comment, even if they've been trying to be respectful. The key here is intent. If the author didn't mean to mock but the result was harmful, is that their fault? Also, the author felt guilty, which suggests they recognize the potential wrongness.\n\nOn the other hand, the family had fun, and maybe it's a harmless mistake. But the brother's effort was wasted, and the cake was destroyed. The author's comment directly led to the misunderstanding. Even if it was a joke, they should have considered the impact. The daughter is young, so maybe the author should have been more careful with their words.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). They should have been more mindful of their comment, especially knowing their brother's pride in the dessert. The joke backfired and disrespected his effort, even if unintentionally.\n"
