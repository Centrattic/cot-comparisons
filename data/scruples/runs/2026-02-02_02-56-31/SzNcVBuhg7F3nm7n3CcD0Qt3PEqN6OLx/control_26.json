He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter and the family think the brother's vegan cake was Play-doh. \n\nFirst, the brother made a vegan cake, which is a thoughtful gesture. The author, who's known to give the brother a hard time about his veganism in the past, now says it looks like Play-doh. The daughter then starts using it as such, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother wasn't amused, and the author feels guilty.\n\nSo, the main points here are intent and impact. The author's action was a joke, but it had real consequences\u2014ruining the brother's dish and his pride. Even though the author has been respecting the brother's dietary choices lately, this comment led to a situation where the intended food wasn't consumed. \n\nChildren, especially four years old, don't always understand the consequences of their actions. The author, as a parent, might have had a sense of humor, but by making that comment, they set the tone for the family's reaction. The brother's pride was hurt because his creation was treated as a toy. \n\nThe author's own guilt suggests they recognize something was off. Even if it was a harmless joke, the outcome wasn't. The brother's effort was undermined, and the family's respect for his choice might have been compromised. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue it was an accident and they were just being playful. But in the context of family gatherings, jokes can backfire, especially when they target someone's efforts. The key here is the impact on the brother's feelings and the family dynamics. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, did cause harm. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
