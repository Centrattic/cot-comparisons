He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for this situation where they made their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, who usually gives the brother a hard time about his veganism, told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The whole family then played with the cake, and the brother was upset because they didn't eat his creation. The author feels guilty but also had fun making fun of the brother.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Let's break it down. The brother put effort into making a dessert, expecting it to be eaten. The author's comment led to the cake being used as play-doh, which ruined the brother's intention. The author's action was intentional, even if it was a joke. The daughter is young, so the author might have known she wouldn't know better, so they used her innocence to make a joke at the brother's expense.\n\nBut the author says they've been respectful of the brother's veganism lately, so maybe they didn't mean to be mean. However, the action still had consequences. The brother was not amused, and the family didn't eat his dessert. The author might have overstepped by using the child to make a joke, even if it was harmless. But was it wrong? It depends on intent and if they should have considered the brother's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother made a cake that looked like Play-Doh. Maybe he should have considered presentation. But the author's action was the direct cause. The author's guilt is mentioned, so maybe they see it as a mistake. But the question is if they are in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. If the author's action was a joke that went too far, then maybe they are at fault. But if it was a harmless mistake with no malice, perhaps not. However, using a child to play a trick on someone else might be considered wrong. The brother's feelings were hurt, so the author might have been negligent in considering the impact. \n\nSo, likely answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because the author knowingly made a joke that led to the brother's creation being disrespected, even if unintentionally. They should have thought about how it would affect their brother.\n"
