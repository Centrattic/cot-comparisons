He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did something wrong by making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a vegan cake, which he was proud of. The user, known for teasing the brother about his veganism in the past, made a comment that led the kids to play with the cake. The family joined in, and the brother was upset.\n\nThe key points here are the user's past behavior towards the brother's veganism, the impact on the brother's pride, and the fact that the cake was meant to be eaten. Even though it was a joke, the user's comment directly caused the family to not eat the cake, which the brother had prepared with care. The user might be guilty of not respecting their brother's efforts, even if it was an accident. The four-year-old couldn't be blamed, but the parent's joke led to the situation. There's a balance between humor and respecting others' efforts. The brother's feelings were hurt, which is a sign that the user's actions were inconsiderate. So, the answer would likely be that they are in the wrong.\n"
