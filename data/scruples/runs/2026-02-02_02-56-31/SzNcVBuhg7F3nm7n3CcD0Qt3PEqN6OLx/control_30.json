He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author joked with their daughter that their brother's vegan cake looked like Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset because he put effort into making the cake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they've been teasing their brother about his veganism in the past but have recently been more respectful. This time, the joke was made in the moment, maybe as a spontaneous reaction. The daughter asked what the cake was, and the author responded with \"Play-doh,\" which led to the family playing with it. The brother was not amused, and the cake wasn't eaten.\n\nNow, the key points here: The joke was at the brother's expense, and even though it was meant in good humor, it caused the intended recipient's effort to be wasted. The author acknowledges feeling guilty afterward. The brother made the cake with pride, expecting it to be eaten, but instead, it was treated as a toy. That could be hurtful, even if the author didn't mean to be malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that it was a harmless joke, especially with a young child involved. Kids often don't understand the significance of such things, and the family had fun with it. But the brother's feelings are still valid. The author's comment led others to follow suit, which could be seen as dismissive of the brother's effort and dietary preferences.\n\nAlso, considering the brother is vegan, maybe he put extra effort into making the cake look appealing, and having it mocked, even in a playful way, could be hurtful. The author's past teasing might have made this incident worse, as there could be a pattern of making fun of the brother's choices.\n\nHowever, the author did apologize and felt guilty, showing remorse. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong. Intentions matter, but so do the consequences. The brother's effort was wasted, and the family's actions might have been disrespectful to his dietary choices, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's joke, while perhaps not malicious, did cause distress to the brother and wasted his effort. Even if it was a funny moment for the family, it's important to respect others' efforts and choices. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the brother's feelings and the significance of his effort.\n"
