He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-doh. The author, joking, told their daughter it was Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author mentioned they've been giving their brother a hard time about his veganism but have been respectful lately. This time, they made a joke that led to the brother's cake being ruined. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's playfulness upset him. The author feels guilty because they enjoyed making fun of the brother's effort.\n\nIs the author responsible? Well, they made a joke that they knew might have consequences. The brother was proud of his dessert, so the author should have been more careful. Even though it was a joke, it directly caused the brother's dish to be used as playdough instead of eaten. The family's actions ruined the intended purpose of the dessert. The author's comment was the catalyst for the whole event. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the brother's choice to bring a cake that looks like playdough. Maybe he could have presented it differently. However, the author's joke was the immediate cause. The key here is whether the author's actions were malicious. They said they weren't trying to be mean but just made a joke. However, the consequences were real. The brother felt disrespected, and the author acknowledges feeling guilty. \n\nIn terms of accountability, even a joke can lead to responsibility if it causes harm. The author's comment led to the brother's effort being wasted. The family's actions were a result of the author's initial comment. So, even if it was a joke, the author should have considered the impact. They might not be in the wrong in a malicious sense, but they did cause unintended harm. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes), but I have to check if there's a cultural context or if the brother's own presentation was part of the issue. But the author's intent was a joke, and they didn't mean to cause harm, but they did. So maybe it's a grey area, but the family had a right to be respectful. Hence, AITA would likely say the author is in the wrong because their actions led to disrespect towards the brother's effort, even if it was a joke.\n"
