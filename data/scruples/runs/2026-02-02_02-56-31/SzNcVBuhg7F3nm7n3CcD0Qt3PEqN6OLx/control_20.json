He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother made a vegan dessert, which looked like Play-doh. The author, who has previously given the brother a hard time about his veganism, joked that it was Play-doh to their daughter. The daughter then started playing with it, and the whole family joined in. The brother was upset because his dessert wasn't eaten, and the author feels guilty about the fun they had at his expense.\n\nSo, the key points here are: intent, context, and consequences. The author's comment was a joke, not malicious. They mentioned they've been respecting their brother's choices lately. However, the joke led to the brother's effort being wasted, which could be seen as dismissive of his dietary preferences and effort. \n\nNow, considering social norms, it's common for family members to tease each other, but it's important to respect others' efforts and beliefs. The brother was proud of his creation, and the joke undermined that. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the outcome was that the brother's dessert was not eaten, and he was upset. The fact that the author feels guilty suggests they recognize some wrongdoing, but they might not see it as entirely their fault.\n\nAlso, the daughter was young, so her actions were innocent, but the author initiated the joke. The family's participation might have been playful, but it still disrespected the brother's effort. Veganism is a personal choice, and making light of someone's food, especially when they put effort into it, could be seen as insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intend to disrespect the brother's veganism; they just found the dessert visually similar to Play-doh. The humor was a joke among family, which is common, but the line between humor and disrespect can be thin. The brother's reaction shows that the joke was hurtful, even if unintended.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent wasn't malicious, the action did disrespect the brother's effort and dietary choice. The author should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort he put into the dessert. Therefore, the author is somewhat in the wrong because they didn't take into account how their joke might affect their brother, even if it was unintentional.\n"
