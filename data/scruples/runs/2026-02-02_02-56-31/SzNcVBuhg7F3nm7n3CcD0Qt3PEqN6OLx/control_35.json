He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset because his dessert was ruined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider intent. The author mentioned that they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices lately, but they've given him a hard time before. The comment about the cake being Play-doh was a joke, right? It wasn't meant to be malicious, but it still caused the family to misuse the cake. The brother was proud of his creation, and it's understandable he'd be upset if people played with it instead of eating it, especially since it's vegan and maybe not easy to make.\n\nNow, the author feels guilty because they had fun making fun of their brother. But was it really their fault? They said they couldn't help it because the cake looked and smelled like Play-doh. It's possible they didn't foresee the consequences. However, as a parent, they should have known that their daughter might take the comment seriously. Even if it was a joke, the result was that the dessert was ruined. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's choice to make a cake that looks like Play-doh might have been a risk, but he was proud of it. The author's comment was the trigger for the family's actions. Even if it was a joke, the author's responsibility as a parent to not mislead their child could be a point. Also, the family's actions led to the brother's dessert being used as a toy, which could be seen as disrespectful to his effort.\n\nBut then again, maybe the brother should have considered how his cake might look. However, the main action here is the author's comment. They said it in front of the child, so the responsibility is on them. Even if it was accidental, they should have considered the outcome. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. It's not a malicious act, but it led to a negative consequence. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because it was a mistake, but they could have been more careful. However, since the action directly caused the problem, they might be considered in the wrong for not thinking it through. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that it's a family event and the brother should have made something more appetizing. But the brother was proud of his vegan dessert, and the author's comment undermined that. So overall, the author probably is in the wrong because they caused the family to act in a way that ruined the brother's creation, even if unintentionally.\n"
