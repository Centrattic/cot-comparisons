He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the brother made a vegan cake, the author joked that it looked like Play-Doh, the daughter took the bait, and the family ended up using the cake as playdough. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentioned they've been giving their brother a hard time about his veganism before, but lately, they've been more respectful. So maybe there's a history here. The brother was proud of his dessert, which was a big deal for him. The joke was made in a family setting, but it led to the cake being destroyed and not eaten. The author feels guilty but also had fun.\n\nNow, the key points: Was the joke intentional? It sounds like it was a spontaneous comment, maybe meant as a lighthearted joke. The daughter's innocent question prompted the response. The author didn't plan for the family to actually use the cake as playdough. However, the consequences were that the brother's effort was wasted, and he was upset. The author's daughter was young and might not understand the context of the joke.\n\nOn one hand, family jokes can be normal, but in this case, it affected the brother's pride and the purpose of the dessert. The brother might have put in effort to make something special for the family, and the joke undermined that. Even if it was a joke, the author didn't consider the impact on their brother's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended harm. The comment was a reaction to the cake's appearance, and the daughter's action was innocent. The family ended up having fun, maybe not realizing the cake wasn't meant to be eaten. However, the author should have considered the brother's feelings and maybe clarified the joke to prevent the family from actually using the cake as playdough.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? They made a joke that led to unintended consequences. Even if the joke was meant in good humor, they should have been more mindful of the brother's effort and feelings. The author's responsibility here might be to acknowledge the brother's effort and clarify the joke to prevent the cake from being ruined. Therefore, the author could be seen as at fault for not considering the impact of their words and actions.\n"
