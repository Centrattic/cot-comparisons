(One tmrw) He's super mad at me and the situation cause its push week in WoW apparently, and to avoid a fight I now cook for us both.\nNot much to say. I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's push week for their game, World of Warcraft, and now the user is cooking for both of them to avoid an argument. The user says their boyfriend gets scary when he's mad, and he argues that this is a crucial time for the game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has six exams coming up, one of which is tomorrow. That's a lot of pressure and a short time to prepare. It's reasonable they might need support from their partner, like help with cooking so they can study. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in a critical part of his game, which might be important to him. However, exams are a significant academic responsibility and can affect the user's future. \n\nBut the key point here is the argument and the boyfriend getting scary when angry. That's a red flag. If the boyfriend is making the user feel scared, that's a serious issue. Emotional or physical abuse can't be ignored. The user is trying to manage their studies, which are time-sensitive, and the boyfriend's reaction is causing distress. \n\nThe user is cooking for both now to avoid fighting, but that might not be a sustainable or fair solution. Both partners should be able to support each other's priorities. However, if the boyfriend is unwilling to compromise and is causing fear, that's a bigger problem than the initial request. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They wanted help during a stressful time, which is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction is problematic. The user isn't wrong for needing support, especially in an emergency. The real issue is the boyfriend's response and his inability to manage his priorities. Therefore, the user isn't at fault here.\n"
