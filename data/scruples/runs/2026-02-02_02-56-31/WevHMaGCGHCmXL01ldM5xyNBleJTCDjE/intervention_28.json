I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a female, 18, and her boyfriend is male, 21. She's asking if she's in the wrong for wanting him to cook so she can study for exams. She has six exams coming up in 8 days, one tomorrow. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which I know is a game where there are weekly events or updates that players often prioritize. The user mentioned that the boyfriend is mad, and she ended up cooking for both to avoid a fight. She also said he's scaring her when he's angry, and he emphasized that this week is crucial for the game, so he couldn't miss it, even for a few hours.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, she's in an academic crunch with major exams. It's reasonable for her to need time to study. She's asking for help with cooking, which is a common household task. The boyfriend, however, is prioritizing a game event. The fact that he's getting upset and she feels scared when he's angry is a red flag. Emotional safety is important in a relationship. If his anger is making her uncomfortable or scared, that's a concerning behavior, regardless of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, he might feel that he's dedicating time to his gaming, which is his interest. But the user's exams are time-sensitive and important. The boyfriend's response might be inconsiderate if he's not willing to compromise. She's trying to balance her responsibilities, and he's not supporting her during a stressful time.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. If she asked him to cook and he refused, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But she's taking the initiative to study, which is responsible. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his priorities than a valid reason to be angry. Also, she's now cooking for both to avoid conflict, which shows she's trying to manage things peaceably, but he's not willing to reciprocate.\n\nIn terms of fairness, she's not wrong for needing support during exams. The boyfriend's anger and his prioritization of the game over her academic needs could indicate a lack of support. The fact that she feels scared when he's angry is a bigger issue. Healthy relationships involve supporting each other's important goals and managing conflicts without causing fear.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, especially the emotional response. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
