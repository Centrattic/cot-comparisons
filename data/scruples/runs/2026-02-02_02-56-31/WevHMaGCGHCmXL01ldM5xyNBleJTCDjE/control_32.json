      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is at fault here. Let me break this down. The situation is that the author, a female 18-year-old, wants her boyfriend, a 21-year-old, to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams in the next eight days, one of which is tomorrow. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which he considers really important. To avoid a fight, the author ends up cooking for both. She mentions that when she told him to let her do it alone, he scared her when he was angry. He argues it's one of the most important weeks of the season and can't miss a few hours for cooking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the priorities. The author has a significant academic deadline, which is a big deal. Exams can affect her future, so her need to study is valid. On the other hand, the boyfriend is invested in his gaming schedule. But is his gaming commitment more important than helping his partner during a critical time? That's the crux.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be more intense. He's \"super mad\" and the author feels scared when he's angry. That might indicate that his reaction is disproportionate or maybe he's not handling stress well. Also, the fact that the author is now cooking for both suggests that their communication might be an issue. The boyfriend not being able to take a few hours during his \"push week\" to help her with cooking could mean he's not prioritizing her academic needs, which are time-sensitive and high-stakes.\n\nAnother angle is the balance of responsibilities in a relationship. Partners should support each other. The author is trying to manage her studies, and the boyfriend is supposed to support her by taking on cooking duties. However, he's refusing, which could be seen as not supporting her. But maybe the boyfriend has his own commitments. However, the author is clearly in a time crunch, which is more urgent and impactful for her future.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument about the game's push week being important is valid for him, but the author's exams are more critical for her. The problem arises when his refusal leads to conflict and he ends up cooking for both when he initially refused. The fact that he's mad and the author feels scared adds another layer, possibly indicating that his anger is excessive or that there's a pattern of behavior where he's not respecting her needs.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is asking if she's in the wrong for wanting him to cook so she can study. Considering the context, the author's need to prepare for exams is a valid and high-priority task. The boyfriend's refusal, especially given the time constraint and the fact that the author is already stressed, might indicate that he's not providing the support she needs. The author feeling scared when he's angry is a red flag, suggesting that his reaction is unhealthy. Therefore, the boyfriend might be in the wrong here, making the author not at fault.\n"
