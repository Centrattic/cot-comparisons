I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six upcoming exams in eight days. The boyfriend is upset because it's a big push week for him in WoW. The user mentioned that the boyfriend is angry and she's now cooking for both, but it's making her scared when he's mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The user has exams, which are important for their academic future. Time management is crucial here. Asking for help with cooking to save time and focus on studying seems reasonable. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in a critical phase of a game, which he clearly values a lot. The fact that he's \"super mad\" and the situation has led to the user feeling scared when he's angry is a red flag. Healthy relationships should involve mutual respect and support, not causing fear.\n\nThe key points here are the user's need to study for multiple exams soon and the boyfriend's reaction. While both have their priorities, the boyfriend's anger and the user's fear suggest that communication might be an issue. It's understandable to ask for help during a stressful time, but the boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if it's causing distress. The user's decision to cook for both to avoid a fight shows they're trying to maintain peace, but it shouldn't come at the cost of their own well-being. The boyfriend should be supportive of her academic responsibilities, just as she should consider his commitments, but the way he's reacting is problematic. So, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking help, especially when it's clear that the boyfriend's anger is affecting her safety and comfort.\n"
