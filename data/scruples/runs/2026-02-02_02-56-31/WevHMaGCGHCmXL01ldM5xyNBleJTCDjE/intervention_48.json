I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a big week for his game, World of Warcraft. The user ended up cooking for both, but the boyfriend was mad and scary when angry. They told him to let her do it alone because he scared her. The question is whether the user is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has six exams coming up in eight days, which is a lot. It's reasonable to ask for help with chores like cooking to save time and reduce stress. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own important event, \"push week\" in WoW, which he claims is crucial. The user is now cooking for both, but the boyfriend's anger and the fact that his anger scares her is a red flag.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's needs. If the boyfriend is upset about cooking, maybe they could have found a compromise, like taking turns or simplifying meals. However, his reaction being so intense that he's scaring her suggests a lack of respect for her academic pressures. It's also important to note that the user is the one with exams, which are time-sensitive and critical for their education. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument about his own priorities might be valid, but if he's unwilling to adjust, it shows a lack of support. The fact that he's angry and his anger is making the user feel scared is more concerning. In this case, the user isn't in the wrong for needing help during a stressful time. The boyfriend's inability to manage his priorities and his aggressive reaction are the main issues here. So the answer should be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
