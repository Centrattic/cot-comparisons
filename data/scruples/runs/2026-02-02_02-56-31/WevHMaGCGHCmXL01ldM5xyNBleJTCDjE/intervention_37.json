I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a female 18-year-old, and her boyfriend is 21. She's asking if she's in the wrong for wanting him to cook so she can study for her six upcoming exams in eight days, especially since one is tomorrow. He's upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which he considers important. She ended up cooking for both, and he's mad. She mentioned he's scaring her when he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On her side, she has a major academic deadline, which is crucial for her future. She's under a lot of stress and needs time to study. She's asking for help, which is reasonable in a relationship. On his side, he's invested in his game, and he's prioritizing that, which he sees as important. However, she's a student with exams, which are time-sensitive and have real-world consequences.\n\nCommunication seems to be an issue. If she asked him to help and he refused, maybe he could have explained why it's important to him and they could have found a compromise. But she felt scared when he got mad, which is concerning. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear. He might need to manage his anger and be more supportive during her stressful times. \n\nShe did take initiative by cooking for both after he refused, which shows she's trying to handle the situation. However, the fact that he's so upset about the game week might indicate he's not prioritizing her needs when they conflict. Exams are a bigger commitment and have more long-term impact than a game event. \n\nAlso, the age difference isn't huge, but both are young adults. Balancing personal hobbies and supporting each other's responsibilities is part of a mature relationship. His reaction leading to her feeling scared is a red flag. Support and understanding are key when a partner is under stress. \n\nSo, considering all that, she's not in the wrong. He should have found a way to help her even if his game week is important. His anger and making her feel scared are on him. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
