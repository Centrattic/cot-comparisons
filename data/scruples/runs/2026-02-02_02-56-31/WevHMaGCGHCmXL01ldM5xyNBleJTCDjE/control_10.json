I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a major week for his game, World of Warcraft. The user now cooks for both to avoid a fight, but the boyfriend is still mad. The user also mentions that the boyfriend is scaring them when he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has six exams in eight days, which is a significant academic pressure. Asking for help with cooking to focus on studying seems reasonable. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a busy schedule with \"push week\" in WoW, which is important for him. However, the boyfriend's reaction is causing fear in the user, which is a red flag. Emotional safety is crucial in a relationship. \n\nThe user is taking the initiative to manage the situation by cooking themselves to avoid conflict, which shows they're trying to be considerate. The boyfriend's anger and the user feeling scared might indicate that he's not handling the stress well, perhaps overreacting. The user isn't being selfish by needing space to study; that's a legitimate academic responsibility. The boyfriend should be supportive, even if his own priorities are important.\n\nHowever, communication is key. Both sides need to discuss their needs and find a balance. The user isn't necessarily wrong for asking for help, especially if it's a short-term request. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own stress than the request itself. The fact that the user is now cooking for both suggests they're making an effort, but the boyfriend's continued anger might be the real issue here. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support is important. The user's exams are a time-sensitive, high-pressure situation. The boyfriend's WoW commitment is important, but it shouldn't override the user's academic needs. The user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their studies, especially if they're making compromises. The boyfriend's response seems disproportionate and harmful, particularly when he's making the user feel scared. Emotional abuse is a serious issue, and if the boyfriend is acting in a way that's making the user feel unsafe, that's a problem regardless of the situation.\n"
