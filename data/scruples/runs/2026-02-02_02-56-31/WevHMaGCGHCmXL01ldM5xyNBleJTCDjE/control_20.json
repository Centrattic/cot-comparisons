      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook meals so they can study for six upcoming exams in the next eight days, with one exam the next day. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which he considers a crucial time. The author ended up cooking for both to avoid conflict and mentioned that the boyfriend's anger is scaring them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is under significant academic pressure with exams coming up. It's reasonable to ask for support from a partner, especially when the exams are time-sensitive and important. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is also invested in his gaming activity, which he deems important. However, the key points here are the timing and the emotional impact. The author is prioritizing their exams, which are real responsibilities with deadlines, while the boyfriend is prioritizing a game event. Additionally, the boyfriend's reaction is intense enough that the author feels scared, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships should involve mutual support and respect, not making the other person feel anxious or threatened. The fact that the author had to take over cooking to avoid a fight suggests the boyfriend isn't being considerate of their stress. The boyfriend's inability to adjust his schedule by a few hours for such a critical time in the author's life might indicate a lack of support. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking help during a high-stress period, especially when the boyfriend's reaction is harmful.\n"
