I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which he considers super important. They ended up in a situation where the girl is now cooking for both to avoid a fight, but she's scared when he's angry.\n\nFirst, the girl has six exams coming up in eight days, one of which is the next day. That's a lot of pressure. It's reasonable for her to want to focus on studying, especially when the exams are time-sensitive. Cooking takes time and energy, so asking him to handle it so she can study seems logical. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is stressed about his own commitment with the game. But he's being asked to spend a few hours cooking, which isn't an unreasonable request, especially when it's for his partner's academic success. However, he's getting angry and the situation escalated to the point where she's scared. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships involve compromise and mutual support, not making the other person feel scared. The girl's priority is her studies, which are important for her future. The boyfriend's issue is about a game, which is less critical. But he's not standing his ground; he's getting angry and making her cook for both to avoid a fight. That doesn't sound fair. She's the one adjusting her behavior (cooking instead of studying) because he's being difficult, which isn't right. So, while both have valid points, the boyfriend's reaction is problematic because it's causing fear. The girl isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her exams and asking for help. The boyfriend isn't handling his stress well. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
