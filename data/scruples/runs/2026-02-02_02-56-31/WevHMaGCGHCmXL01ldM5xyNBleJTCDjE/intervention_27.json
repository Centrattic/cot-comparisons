I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's push week for their game, WoW. The user mentioned they ended up cooking for both and the boyfriend gets scary when angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has six exams coming up, one the next day, which is a big deal. It's reasonable to ask for help with chores to focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend's push week is important for the game, and he might feel that his priorities are being overlooked. But the user is in a stressful situation with exams, which are critical for their academic future. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is a problem. The user said he's super mad, and it's leading to them cooking for both, which might be adding more stress. The fact that the boyfriend is getting scary when angry is a red flag. Healthy relationships should support each other's needs without causing fear. So the boyfriend's response might be over the top. \n\nThe user isn't wrong for needing support during a stressful time. However, the boyfriend's inability to compromise or communicate effectively might be the real issue here. The user's exams are time-sensitive and important, so asking for help isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend should be understanding and find a way to balance his gaming commitments with supporting his partner's academic needs. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Maybe they could have negotiated, like the boyfriend helping for a few hours when possible. But the user did ask him, and he refused, leading to conflict. The key point is that the boyfriend's reaction, especially being scary when angry, is not acceptable. The user's safety and comfort in the relationship are important. \n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking help during a critical time. The boyfriend's inability to manage his own priorities and his negative reaction are the main issues here. So the answer would be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
