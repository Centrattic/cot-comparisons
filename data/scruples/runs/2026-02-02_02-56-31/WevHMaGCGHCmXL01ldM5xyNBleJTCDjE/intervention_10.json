I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is really upset because it's a big week for his game, WoW. They ended up cooking for both, but the guy is mad, and the user is scared when he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has six exams in eight days, one the next day. That's a lot of pressure. It's reasonable to want support during such a critical time. On the other hand, the boyfriend's push week in WoW is important to him, but cooking for two shouldn't take hours, right? Maybe he's overreacting or the time conflict is real?\n\nCommunication is key here. The user asked him to cook, which is a reasonable request, especially when they're stressed. But if he felt that missing even a few hours would hinder his game progress, maybe there's a conflict in priorities. However, cooking shouldn't take that much time. The user's main need is studying, which is a significant life event. The boyfriend's reaction leading to the user feeling scared is a red flag. Emotional distress in a relationship is serious.\n\nThe user now cooks for both to avoid a fight, but that might not be fair. Relationships should involve mutual support. If the boyfriend is unwilling to compromise during a stressful time for the user, that could indicate a deeper issue. The user isn't at fault for needing help, but maybe there's a lack of understanding from the boyfriend's side. The main issue here is the boyfriend's reaction and the user's fear, which points to an imbalance. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the user's request is valid, and the boyfriend's behavior is problematic.\n"
