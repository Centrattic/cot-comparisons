I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a big week for him in World of Warcraft. The situation seems to involve balancing responsibilities and priorities between the two.\n\nFirst, the author has six exams coming up, one the next day, which is a significant academic commitment. They want their partner to handle cooking to focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in \"push week\" for WoW, which he considers very important. He's angry because he feels the author is asking him to sacrifice time he needs for his own priorities. \n\nThe author now cooks for both after a fight, maybe to avoid conflict. The boyfriend's anger escalated to the point where the author felt scared. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear. The key points here are mutual respect for each other's priorities and communication. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme if he's getting angry and scaring the author. Prioritizing gaming during a partner's exam period might not be supportive. However, the author's request to have the boyfriend cook is reasonable, especially under stress. The boyfriend's response, leading to the author feeling scared, suggests he overreacted. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both have valid needs. But the boyfriend's reaction and the intimidation factor indicate he might be in the wrong. The author isn't wrong for needing support during exams. Relationships require compromise, but when one partner feels threatened, that's a problem. So the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but the boyfriend's behavior is the issue here.\n"
