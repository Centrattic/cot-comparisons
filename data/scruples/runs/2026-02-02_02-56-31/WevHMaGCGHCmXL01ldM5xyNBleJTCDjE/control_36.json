      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a female 18-year-old, wants her boyfriend, who's 21, to cook so she can study for six exams coming up in the next eight days, one of which is tomorrow. The boyfriend is really upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which I know is a game with events that players often prioritize. The author ends up cooking for both of them to avoid a fight. She mentions that when she told him to let her do it alone, he was scaring her when he was mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks of the season and couldn't miss it for a few hours.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author has a valid reason: she's preparing for important exams. Her academic responsibilities are time-sensitive and crucial for her future. On the other hand, her boyfriend is participating in a game event that he considers very important. However, the key points here are the balance of responsibilities and the health of their relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction being so intense that he's scaring her is a red flag. Even if his event is important, his response seems disproportionate. The fact that he's angry about cooking for a few hours during which she's studying might indicate that he's not considering her academic pressures. Cooking is a shared responsibility in a relationship, especially when one partner has a pressing need. The author is trying to manage her studies, which are a major life commitment, while he's prioritizing a game event. It's possible that he's not taking her exams seriously, which are more critical for her future.\n\nMoreover, the boyfriend's insistence on cooking could be seen as him not supporting her during a stressful time. If he's truly concerned about the event, they could have found a compromise, like cooking together or the author doing it while he spends a short time on the game. However, his anger and the fact that he's making her cook both for them to avoid a fight suggests that he's not willing to make a reasonable sacrifice. \n\nThe author's decision to cook both meals might be a temporary solution, but it's not sustainable. The real issue is the lack of support and understanding from the boyfriend. His reaction being scary is a significant concern, indicating that his anger might be an ongoing problem. In a healthy relationship, partners should support each other's needs, especially when one is dealing with high-stress situations like exams.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the boyfriend's behavior seems to be the issue here. He's not accommodating her needs, and his reaction is harmful. The author is trying to focus on her exams, which are important, and the boyfriend's refusal to help during this time could be seen as a lack of support. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the boyfriend is not meeting his responsibilities as a partner.\n"
