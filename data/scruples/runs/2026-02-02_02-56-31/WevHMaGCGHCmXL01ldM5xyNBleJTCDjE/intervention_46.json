I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six exams in the next eight days. The boyfriend is mad because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which I assume is World of Warcraft, a game. The user now cooks for both to avoid a fight and says the boyfriend gets scary when mad.\n\nFirst, the user is dealing with a lot of stress from upcoming exams. It's logical that they need time to study. Asking a partner to help with cooking in that situation seems reasonable. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is prioritizing gaming, which is time-consuming. The user feels scared when he's angry, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear or making someone feel unsafe. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. If he's so invested in the game, maybe he should manage his time better. The user is in a tough spot with exams and is trying to balance responsibilities. The fact that he's getting angry and making the user cook now shows he's not supportive. The user's main issue is the fear during arguments, which points to potential issues in the relationship dynamics. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their studies and needing help. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here. The answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
