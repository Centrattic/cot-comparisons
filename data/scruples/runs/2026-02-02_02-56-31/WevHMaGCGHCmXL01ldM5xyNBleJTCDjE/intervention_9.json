I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for upcoming exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which I assume is a big event for the game. The user ended up cooking for both to avoid a fight, but the boyfriend was angry and scared her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has six exams in eight days, which is a lot. It's reasonable to want some help with chores like cooking to focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend's \"push week\" in WoW might be important to him, but how important is it compared to the user's exams? If he's spending hours on the game, maybe that's a problem. The user mentioned that he was mad and scaring her, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships should support each other's priorities. If he's unwilling to compromise or support her during her exams, that's an issue. But the user also had exams and needed help, so expecting some support isn't unreasonable. However, maybe she could have communicated better or found a middle ground. But the fact that he got angry and she felt scared suggests he's not being supportive. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. But I need to be careful not to oversimplify. The boyfriend's behavior might be the bigger issue here, but the user's request seems valid too.\n"
