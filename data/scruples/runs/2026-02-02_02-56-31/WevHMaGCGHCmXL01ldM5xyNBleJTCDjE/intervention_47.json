I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a female in a relationship with a male partner. She's dealing with six upcoming exams over the next eight days, one of which is tomorrow. She wants her boyfriend to help with cooking so she can focus on studying. However, he's very upset because it's a crucial week for his game, World of Warcraft, and he's involved in something called \"push week.\" To avoid a fight, she ends up cooking for both of them. He got angry, and she felt scared when he was mad. He argues that this week is one of the most important in the season and couldn't miss it for a few hours.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The woman is under significant academic pressure with exams coming up soon. It's reasonable for her to seek support from her partner to manage her responsibilities. On the other hand, her boyfriend is committed to an important event in his game, which he considers crucial. The key points here are mutual respect and communication. \n\nShe asked him to cook, which is a reasonable request given her circumstances. However, he refused because of his obligations. The fact that he got so angry that she felt scared is concerning. Healthy relationships require mutual support and understanding. If he's unable to provide that, it might indicate an issue in how he handles stress or his partner's needs. \n\nThe user ended up cooking for both, which might be a compromise, but the fact that he's mad and the situation caused a fight suggests a lack of communication. She felt the need to assert herself, which is valid if she felt intimidated. The boyfriend's reaction being scary when angry is a red flag, as emotional safety is crucial in a relationship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have valid needs. She's prioritizing her exams, which are important for her future. He's prioritizing his game. However, the way he handled the situation, especially the anger and making her feel unsafe, is problematic. The question is whether she's in the wrong for asking for help. Since she's under stress and the request was reasonable, it's not her fault. The issue lies in how he responded and his inability to support her during a tough time. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), she isn't in the wrong. The main issues are his reaction and lack of support, not her asking for help.\n"
