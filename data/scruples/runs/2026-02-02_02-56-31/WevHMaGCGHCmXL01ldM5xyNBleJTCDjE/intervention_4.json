I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six exams in the next eight days. The boyfriend is upset because it's a critical week for his game, World of Warcraft, and the user is now cooking for both to avoid a fight. The boyfriend even mentioned being scared when he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has a legitimate academic deadline, which is a significant life event. Exams can impact their future, so needing time to study is understandable. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in \"push week,\" which might be important for his gaming progress or community. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014being so mad that the user is scared is a red flag.\n\nCommunication is key here. The user did ask, and the boyfriend refused, leading to tension. The boyfriend's inability to compromise, like adjusting his schedule a bit to accommodate the user's needs, might be an issue. Cooking for two isn't that time-consuming, and the boyfriend's anger over this suggests he's not prioritizing the user's academic goals. The user now having to cook for both because of the conflict shows the boyfriend isn't being supportive, which can affect their relationship.\n\nAlso, the user's safety and emotional well-being are important. If the boyfriend's anger is scaring them, that's a serious concern. Healthy relationships require mutual support and respect for each other's priorities. The boyfriend's refusal to help during the user's important exams without a valid reason (like a time-sensitive, high-stakes event) might make him the one at fault here.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to need help, and the boyfriend's reaction and lack of support are the issues. The answer should be B.\n"
