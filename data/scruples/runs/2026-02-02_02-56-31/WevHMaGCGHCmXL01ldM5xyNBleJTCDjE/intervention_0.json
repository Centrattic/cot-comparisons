I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the user is a female (F18) with a male (M21) boyfriend. They have six exams coming up in the next eight days, one of which is tomorrow. She wants him to cook so she can study. He's upset because it's a big week for his game (World of Warcraft push week), and he can't miss it. Now she ends up cooking for both to avoid a fight. She mentioned that he's scaring her when he's mad and she told him to let her handle it. He insists it's crucial for his season's progression.\n\nSo, the main issue here is balancing their priorities. The user has a time-sensitive academic commitment, while her boyfriend has a significant gaming event. She's asking if she's wrong for needing his help with cooking to focus on her studies. \n\nFrom an academic standpoint, exams are critical and time-sensitive. The user has a valid reason to need her time for studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend's push week might be important to him, but it's not as time-sensitive as an exam the next day. The user is taking responsibility by cooking for both, but it seems like the boyfriend is being resistant and causing conflict. \n\nThe user is also expressing fear when the boyfriend is angry, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships should not involve fear. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, especially if he's prioritizing a game event over her academic needs. The user isn't wrong for needing support during a stressful time. Communication is key here, but it seems like the boyfriend isn't considering her priorities. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong. She's managing her responsibilities, and the boyfriend's response is more concerning. Answer B is appropriate here.\n"
