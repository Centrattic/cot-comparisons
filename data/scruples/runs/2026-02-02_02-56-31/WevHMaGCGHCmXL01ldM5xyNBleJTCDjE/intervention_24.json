I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's push week for his WoW, and now she's cooking for both. She mentioned he's mad and she's scared when he's angry.\n\nFirst, the exams are important for her future. It's reasonable to ask for help with basic tasks like cooking to focus on studying, especially with one exam the next day. However, the boyfriend's push week in a game might conflict with that. But games are time-consuming but not critical like exams. \n\nThe user is taking on the cooking now to avoid a fight, but the boyfriend's anger is a red flag. If he's upset about cooking, maybe he's not considering her stress. Also, if he's scaring her when angry, that's a bigger issue. The key here is the balance of responsibilities and mutual support in a relationship. \n\nShe's asking for temporary help during a stressful time. It's normal to ask for support. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if it's causing fear. So, the answer would lean towards the user not being in the wrong because her exams are crucial, and the boyfriend's anger is a problem, not her needing help. But it's a nuanced situation where communication is key. The main issue is his reaction, not her request.\n"
