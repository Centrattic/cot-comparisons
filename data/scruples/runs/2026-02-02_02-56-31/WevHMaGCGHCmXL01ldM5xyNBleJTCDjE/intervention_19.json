      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user (AITA) is an 18-year-old female whose boyfriend is a 21-year-old male. He's supposed to cook for both of them so she can study for six exams coming up in the next eight days, with one exam tomorrow. But the boyfriend is really upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which I think is a game where there's a major event or update. To avoid a fight, the user now ends up cooking for both of them. She told him to let her do it alone because he's scary when he's angry. He argued that this is one of the most important weeks of the season for the game, so he can't miss it for a few hours.\n\nSo the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user is preparing for exams, which are important for her academic future. She's asking her boyfriend to help with cooking so she can focus on studying. That seems reasonable because exams are time-sensitive and critical. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own priorities (the game's push week), which he considers important. However, his reaction is anger, and the user feels scared when he's mad. That's a red flag because no one should feel unsafe in a relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he can't miss the push week, but he's supposed to help with cooking, which is a few hours. If it's important for her studies, she might need his support. However, if he's being abusive or threatening when he's angry, that's a serious issue. The user's decision to cook for both to avoid a fight suggests that there's a power imbalance or fear in the relationship. \n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should support each other's important goals. If the boyfriend can't adjust his priorities to help her during a critical time, maybe there's a problem. But then again, if he's dedicating time to a game, perhaps he's not prioritizing her needs adequately. However, the fact that he's getting angry and making her feel scared is a bigger problem. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for needing help with exams. The boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate. The user is right to set boundaries for her safety. Therefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
