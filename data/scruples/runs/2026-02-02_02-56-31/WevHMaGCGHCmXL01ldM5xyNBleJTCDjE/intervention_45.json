I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a big week for his game, World of Warcraft. The user ended up cooking for both because they didn't want to fight, but the boyfriend is still mad. The user says he's scaring her when he's angry.\n\nHmm, first, the user has a lot of exams coming up, which is a major stressor. It's reasonable to ask for help, especially when time is limited. Cooking can be time-consuming, so delegating that task to study is understandable. The boyfriend is in a \"push week\" for the game, which he considers important. But can his gaming commitment take precedence over helping his partner study? That's the crux.\n\nThe user mentioned that when she asked him to cook, he got mad, and now she's doing it herself. She also says he's scaring her when angry. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear. If he's getting angry over cooking, maybe there's a communication issue or imbalance in responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that the user isn't sharing the cooking duties, especially since he's busy with the game. But if he's not willing to compromise, that's a problem. The user is trying to manage her time for exams, which are critical for her academic future. Priorities matter here. Exams can have long-term consequences, while a game push is temporary.\n\nThe fact that the user now has to cook for both because of his anger suggests that he's not being flexible. Healthy relationships require give and take. If he's unwilling to adjust his schedule even a bit to support her during exams, that could indicate a lack of support. Also, the emotional aspect\u2014her feeling scared\u2014is significant. Anger leading to fear is not acceptable behavior in a relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong for asking for help. The boyfriend's reaction and the resulting fear are problematic. The user is prioritizing her exams, which is reasonable, and the boyfriend's response is not supportive. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the user is not in the wrong).\n"
