I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault here. The situation is about their boyfriend not wanting to cook because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft. They need to study for six exams, so they wanted him to cook. But he got mad, and now she's cooking for both. She feels scared when he's angry and told him to leave her alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user is under a lot of pressure with exams, which is a valid reason to need help with chores. It's not unreasonable to ask for support during such a stressful time. On the other hand, the boyfriend is also stressed because of his game activity. But the key point here is the emotional response. He got angry and she felt scared, which is a red flag in any relationship. Healthy relationships involve mutual support, not making each other feel unsafe.\n\nAlso, cooking is a basic shared responsibility in a relationship. If he can't help during a busy week, maybe they need to discuss how to manage responsibilities together. But his reaction being so intense that she has to cook for both and feels scared suggests that he's not respecting her boundaries or her needs. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting support. The issue is more about the boyfriend's reaction and inability to handle stress without being hostile. The fact that she has to take on both cooking and studying alone isn't healthy. She's trying to manage her exams and is asking for help, which he's refusing, leading to conflict. He should find another way to handle his game week without making her feel threatened. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
