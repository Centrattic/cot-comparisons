I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girl wanting her boyfriend to cook so she can study for her exams. She has six exams coming up in eight days, one of which is tomorrow. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which I assume is World of Warcraft, an important event in the game. They got into a fight, and now she's cooking for both of them to avoid conflict. She mentioned that he gets scary when he's mad, which is a red flag.\n\nFirst, the girl's request seems reasonable. She has a lot of exams, which are a major academic responsibility. Cooking is a daily task that can be shared in a relationship. The boyfriend, however, is upset because of his gaming commitment. But exams are typically time-sensitive and high-pressure, whereas gaming events might be recurring or less critical. The boyfriend's reaction being so intense that he's making her scared is concerning. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's priorities, especially when one is dealing with significant stress like exams.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's one of the most important weeks in the season for the game might not outweigh her academic deadlines. Also, the fact that she had to cook for both after he was mad shows he wasn't considerate of her needs. The key point here is the imbalance in prioritizing responsibilities and the emotional impact on the girl. She's in a difficult situation both academically and emotionally. The boyfriend's reaction being scary is a bigger issue than the cooking itself. So, the girl isn't in the wrong for wanting support during her exams. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and she's justified in setting boundaries to protect herself.\n"
