I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which he considers really important. The author ends up cooking for both of them to avoid a fight, and the boyfriend is mad. The key points here are the balance of responsibilities and priorities in their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has six exams coming up, with one the next day. Studying is a significant responsibility, and they're asking the boyfriend to take over cooking. That's a reasonable request, especially under academic pressure. However, the boyfriend is prioritizing his gaming commitments over helping with cooking. There's an imbalance here if the author is expected to handle all domestic tasks while the boyfriend is focused on his game.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is important too. He's described as being \"super mad\" and the author feels scared when he's angry. This suggests that his reaction might be disproportionate or even emotionally abusive. The fact that the author had to take over cooking to avoid conflict indicates that their needs aren't being respected.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should support each other's major commitments. If the boyfriend is busy with his \"push week,\" maybe they should have discussed alternative arrangements earlier. But the author's need to study for exams is time-sensitive and critical for their academic success. The boyfriend's refusal to help in this situation could be seen as not supporting the author during a stressful time.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his own priorities are important. But if the author is handling all the cooking and cleaning, that's a lot on their plate. The key issue here is whether the author is asking for a reasonable amount of help, which they are, and whether the boyfriend is being unreasonable by not accommodating that. The fact that the author is scared of his anger is a red flag, suggesting that the boyfriend's behavior might be unhealthy, regardless of the situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong for seeking support during a critical exam period. The boyfriend's refusal and angry reaction are problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
