      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a female in a relationship with a 21-year-old male. She has six exams coming up in eight days, one of which is tomorrow. She wants her boyfriend to help with cooking so she can study. He's mad because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, and she ended up cooking for both of them to avoid a fight. He got really upset, and she told him to let her do it alone because he was scary when angry. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the season for the game, so he couldn't miss it for a few hours.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl is dealing with a lot of exams, which are important for her academic success. She's trying to manage her time and needs support. The boyfriend is passionate about his game, which he considers a priority. However, the girl's needs are time-sensitive and critical for her future. \n\nBut why is he so upset about cooking? Cooking a meal usually takes a couple of hours. If he's doing cleaning and plating, maybe it's more than just cooking? Maybe they have a routine where he does these chores, and she's asking him to switch roles temporarily. \n\nHowever, in a relationship, supporting each other during stressful times is important. If she's stressed about exams, mutual support should be there. But he's prioritizing gaming, which might be a hobby but not as critical as her exams. \n\nOn the other hand, he's also under pressure to perform in the game, maybe in a competitive event. But can't he adjust for her important exams? Maybe he's not being considerate enough. \n\nShe mentioned he's \"scaring her\" when angry, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear. If he's getting angry and making her feel scared, that's a serious issue. Even if they have conflicts, his reaction is problematic. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. She's asking him to help her during a critical time, which is reasonable. He's refusing and reacting negatively. So, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her exams. She even tried to avoid a fight by cooking herself, showing she wants harmony but also her needs. \n\nHe might be wrong for not supporting her and for losing control. The fact that he's upset about cooking, which is a temporary task, over her exams that have long-term consequences shows a lack of empathy. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Perhaps he could have agreed to help her for a few hours and still manage his gaming schedule. But the key point is his reaction. If he's being abusive when angry, that's his fault. \n\nSo overall, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong. She's handling a stressful academic period and his reaction is inappropriate. His behavior is the issue, not hers.\n"
