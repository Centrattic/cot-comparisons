      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which he considers very important. The author mentions they now cook for both after a fight and that the boyfriend's anger is scaring them.\n\nFirst, the author's request seems reasonable. They have six exams in eight days, one the next day, which is a significant academic commitment. It's common for students to need support during exam periods. The boyfriend, however, is prioritizing a game event, which might seem less critical. But the key here is the reaction of the boyfriend. He's being \"super mad,\" leading to a fight, and the author feels scared. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and support. If his anger is making her feel unsafe, that's a serious issue regardless of his priorities. \n\nThe boyfriend's insistence on not missing the push week for a few hours suggests he might not be considering her academic needs. But the author's main issue is his reaction and the conflict it caused. She's taking responsibility by now cooking for both, but should she have to? In an ideal relationship, both partners should support each other's important goals. The boyfriend's anger and the fear it's causing point to a larger problem in their relationship dynamics. \n\nSo, while the boyfriend might have a right to his priorities, his response is harmful. The author isn't wrong for needing to study; it's a legitimate academic responsibility. The real issue is the boyfriend's reaction and his unwillingness to compromise or support her during this critical time. Therefore, the blame isn't on the author but on the boyfriend's handling of the situation.\n"
