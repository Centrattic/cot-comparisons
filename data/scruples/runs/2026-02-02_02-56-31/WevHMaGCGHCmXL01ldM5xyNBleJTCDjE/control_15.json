I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a couple where the girl wants the guy to cook so she can study for exams. The guy is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which is important to him. They ended up in a fight, and now she's cooking for both to avoid conflict. She also mentions that he scares her when he's mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has exams coming up, one even tomorrow. Studying is a significant responsibility, and it's understandable she wants to focus. On the other hand, the guy is invested in his game's event, which he deems crucial. The key points here are about balancing responsibilities and mutual respect.\n\nThe girl is asking if she's in the wrong. The guy being upset and causing her to feel scared is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear or making someone feel unsafe. Even if there's a conflict in priorities, the guy's reaction seems excessive if it's making her scared. \n\nThe girl's decision to cook for both to avoid a fight shows she's trying to de-escalate, which is positive. However, the root issue is whether either party's needs are being unreasonable. While the guy's gaming commitment is important to him, it's not a matter of life or death like exams might be for her. But both have valid priorities. \n\nHowever, the main issue here is the guy's behavior when angry. If he's scaring her, that's a problem in the relationship, regardless of the situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking him to cook to study. She's managing her academic responsibilities, which are time-sensitive and critical. The guy's reaction and the emotional distress he causes are more concerning than the initial request. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support during a stressful academic period. The guy's response and the impact on her well-being are the key issues here.\n"
