I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a crucial week for his game, World of Warcraft, called Push Week. The user ended up cooking for both, but the boyfriend got angry and now she's scared when he's mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has a lot of exams coming up, which are important for their academic future. They asked their boyfriend to cook so they could focus on studying. That seems reasonable. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a significant event in his gaming, which he considers important. He might be stressed about it, and maybe the user's request added to his stress.\n\nBut then, the user mentioned that the boyfriend got super mad, and she had to cook for both because of a fight. When she told him to let her do it alone because he was scaring her, he justified it by saying it's one of the most important weeks in the season. That sounds like he's prioritizing his gaming over her academic needs, which might not be the healthiest dynamic in a relationship.\n\nIn a relationship, both partners should support each other's important goals. If the user's exams are a priority, the boyfriend should be understanding. However, if the boyfriend's Push Week is also a significant commitment, maybe there's room for negotiation. But the boyfriend's reaction being so harsh and causing fear in the user is a red flag. No one should be scared of their partner's anger over such matters.\n\nSo, the key points are: the user's academic needs vs. the boyfriend's gaming commitments, and the boyfriend's reaction leading to the user feeling scared. The boyfriend's response seems disproportionate and possibly disrespectful. The user isn't in the wrong for seeking support during a stressful time. It's important for the boyfriend to manage his stress and communicate better rather than reacting with anger. Therefore, the answer should be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
