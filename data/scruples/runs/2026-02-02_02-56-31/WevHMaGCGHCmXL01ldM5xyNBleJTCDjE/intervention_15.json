(One tmrw) He's super mad at me and the situation cause its push week in WoW apparently, and to avoid a fight I now cook for us both.\nNot much to say. I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a female 18-year-old who's in a relationship with a 21-year-old guy. She's facing exams and wants him to cook so she can study. But he's really upset because it's a crucial week for him in World of Warcraft. They ended up fighting, and now she's cooking for both and feels scared when he's angry.\n\nFirst, it's important to consider both sides. The girl is under a lot of pressure with exams, which are a big deal for her academic future. It's reasonable for her to ask for help with chores so she can focus on studying. On the other hand, the guy has his own commitments with the game, which he considers very important. But the key issue here is the reaction he had. He got super mad, leading to a fight, and now she feels scared. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve making someone feel afraid. The fact that she had to take over cooking again suggests there might be an imbalance or lack of communication. The guy's reaction seems disproportionate if helping her study, even for a few hours, is necessary. Also, his prioritizing a game over her academic exams might indicate he's not fully supporting her during a critical time. So, while both have their responsibilities, the way he handled it and the emotional impact on the girl are concerning. The answer is likely B (she's not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's reaction and lack of support are the main issues here.\n"
