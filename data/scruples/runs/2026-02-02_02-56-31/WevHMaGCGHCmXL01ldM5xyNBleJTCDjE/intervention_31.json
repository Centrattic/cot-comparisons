I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault here. The situation is that they want their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six upcoming exams in the next eight days, one of which is tomorrow. The boyfriend is really upset because it's push week in World of Warcraft, a big event for him. The user ended up cooking for both to avoid a fight, and the boyfriend didn't take their request seriously. The user also mentioned that the boyfriend's anger is scaring them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The user has a valid reason: important exams which are time-sensitive and crucial for their academic career. They're trying to manage their time effectively. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a significant event in his gaming community, which he considers important. However, he's not compromising, leading to conflict. \n\nThe user is asking if they're wrong for prioritizing their studies. Well, exams are a major life priority. If the boyfriend isn't willing to adjust for a few hours to support their academic needs, that shows a lack of consideration. The user's main issue is that their request is being ignored, leading to them feeling pressured to take on more responsibility. \n\nAlso, the user mentions feeling scared when the boyfriend is angry. That's a red flag for possible emotional issues in the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if he's refusing to help despite the user's valid reason. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should find a balance. But the exams are time-sensitive and critical, so the user's request isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend's refusal without compromise might be the bigger issue here. The user isn't at fault for needing support during a stressful time. The boyfriend's inability to prioritize the user's needs when necessary could be the problem. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The user is justified in their request, and the boyfriend's reaction is problematic.\n"
