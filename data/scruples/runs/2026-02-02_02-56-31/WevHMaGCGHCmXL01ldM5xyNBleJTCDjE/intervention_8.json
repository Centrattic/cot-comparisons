I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a female 18-year-old asking if they're at fault for wanting their 21-year-old boyfriend to cook so they can study for six upcoming exams in the next eight days. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, and now the user ends up cooking for both to avoid a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user is wrong. The key points here are the user needing to study, the boyfriend's commitment to a game event, and the conflict over cooking duties.\n\nThe user's main argument is that they need time to study for important exams, which is a significant responsibility. The boyfriend, on the other hand, prioritizes his gaming schedule, which he considers important. The user feels pressured and scared when he's angry, leading them to take over cooking to avoid conflict.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, balancing responsibilities is important. The user has exams, which are time-sensitive and crucial for their education. The boyfriend's push week in a game is a personal commitment but not as critical as academic deadlines. The user's request for help with cooking to study is reasonable, and expecting mutual support in a relationship is normal.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014being extremely angry and making the user feel scared\u2014indicates a possible issue in how he's handling the situation. Healthy relationships involve communication and compromise. If the boyfriend is unwilling to adjust for a short period to support his partner's studies, that might show a lack of support. The user taking over cooking to avoid conflict is understandable, but ideally, they should discuss and find a solution that respects both needs.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They're not; they have valid reasons to ask for help with studies. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning. The user isn't wrong for prioritizing their exams and needing support. The boyfriend's inability to adjust for a few hours during a critical study period might be the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
