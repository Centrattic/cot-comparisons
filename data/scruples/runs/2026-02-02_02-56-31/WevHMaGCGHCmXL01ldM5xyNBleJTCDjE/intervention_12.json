I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a major push week in WoW. The user is an F18 and the boyfriend is M21.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The user has six exams coming up, one the next day, which is a significant academic pressure. They need time to study, so asking for help with cooking makes sense. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in the middle of an important game event, which he clearly values a lot. He might feel like the user isn't understanding his commitment to the game.\n\nThe user mentioned that the boyfriend is \"super mad\" and that the user now cooks for both to avoid a fight. The user also says the boyfriend is scaring them when angry. That's a red flag. If someone's anger is making you feel scared, that's a serious issue regardless of the cause.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he can't miss a few hours for cooking. But exams are time-sensitive and have real consequences, like affecting grades. It might be reasonable to ask for help during such a stressful period. However, the boyfriend might not see it that way, especially if he's invested in the game.\n\nBut the key point here is the emotional impact. The user is in a stressful situation with exams and is being made to feel guilty for needing support. If the boyfriend's anger is causing fear, that's a problem in the relationship. Healthy relationships involve mutual support and understanding. If the boyfriend is unwilling to compromise or consider the user's needs, that could indicate a deeper issue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong for needing help with cooking to study. They have a valid reason, and the boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and potentially harmful. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the user's academic responsibilities are pressing, and the boyfriend's response seems to be causing emotional distress.\n"
