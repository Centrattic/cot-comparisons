      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting her boyfriend to cook so she can study for exams, while he's upset because it's a crucial time for his game activity.\n\nFirst, the author is a female, 18, and her boyfriend is 21. She's dealing with six upcoming exams in eight days, one of which is tomorrow. She wants him to cook so she can focus on studying. He's very angry about it because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which I know is an online game where certain events or content are time-sensitive. He claims it's one of the most important weeks of the season and can't miss it for a few hours to cook. To avoid a fight, she's now cooking for both. She also mentions he scares her when he's mad, so she told him to let her do it alone.\n\nSo, the key points are: her academic responsibilities vs. his gaming commitment. She's under a lot of academic pressure with exams coming up, which is a significant life event. He's committed to a game-related push, which might be important to him but not as critical as her exams. There's also an emotional aspect where she feels scared when he's angry, which is a red flag in any relationship.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, balancing responsibilities in a relationship is important. Both partners should support each other's priorities. If she's studying for exams, it's reasonable to ask for help with chores, especially when time is limited. However, he's not wrong in wanting to prioritize his own commitments. The problem might be in the communication and the reaction. If he's getting extremely angry and she feels scared, that's a bigger issue. Healthy relationships involve mutual support and understanding. \n\nThe fact that she has to take over cooking because he's upset suggests that he's not being supportive of her academic needs. If his response is making her feel unsafe or intimidated, that's a serious problem. The author isn't necessarily wrong for needing help, but the boyfriend's overreaction is a problem. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the boyfriend is being unreasonable and his reaction is unhealthy.\n"
