I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're at fault for telling their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a 19-year-old female with a 21-year-old boyfriend. She has six exams coming up in the next eight days, one of which is tomorrow. She wants him to handle cooking and cleaning so she can focus on studying. However, her boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft for him, which he considers very important. He's mad and now she's cooking for both of them to avoid a fight. She mentions he gets scary when he's angry, which is a red flag for potential abuse.\n\nSo, the main points here are: her exams are a significant academic commitment, his WoW push week, the conflict over responsibilities, and the emotional aspect where he's causing her fear when angry. The key question is whether her request to have him cook is reasonable and if she's in the wrong for making that request.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On her side, exams are crucial, and studying is time-sensitive. It's understandable she wants support. On his side, he's dealing with his own priorities (WoW push week), which he deems important enough to not want to sacrifice time. However, the fact that he's getting angry and she feels scared when he's mad is a major concern. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear or intimidation.\n\nAlso, the balance of responsibilities. She's asking for help during a stressful time, which is normal. If he's unwilling to compromise, maybe there's an issue with his priorities or communication. But his argument is about his own commitments. However, expecting her to cook instead, when she's already stressed about exams, might not be fair either.\n\nThe fact that she's taking exams and he's choosing to prioritize a game over supporting her in her academic goals could indicate a lack of support, which is important in a relationship. If he's unable to help during her critical time, that's a problem. But it's also about mutual respect and understanding each other's priorities.\n\nAnother angle: the user's request is reasonable, but the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and harmful. The fact that she now feels scared and backs down by cooking herself suggests that he's using emotional pressure or even something more serious. That's a key point. In a healthy relationship, communication should be respectful, not fear-based.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong for needing help during her exams. The boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate, especially if he's causing her to feel scared. The responsibility here isn't solely on the user. The answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's behavior is the issue, not her request for support.\n"
