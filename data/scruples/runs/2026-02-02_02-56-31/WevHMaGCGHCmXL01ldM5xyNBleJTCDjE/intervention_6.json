I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six upcoming exams in eight days. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft. The user mentioned that the boyfriend is super mad, and now she ends up cooking for both. She even said he's scaring her when he's angry. He can't miss a few hours because it's important for the game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has exams coming up, which are a significant academic responsibility. It's reasonable for someone to need focused time to study, especially with six exams in eight days. Cooking can be time-consuming, so asking for help is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is involved in a gaming activity that's important to him. However, when the user asked for help, he reacted angrily, which escalated the situation. The user now feels scared, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and understanding, and if one partner is making the other feel scared, that's a problem.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if he's prioritizing gaming over supporting his partner during a stressful academic period. While hobbies are important, they shouldn't come at the cost of a partner's well-being. The user is trying to manage their stress and responsibilities, which is a valid need. The boyfriend's refusal to help without considering her stress might be contributing to the conflict.\n\nAlso, the user ended up cooking for both of them, which suggests that communication didn't resolve the issue. The boyfriend's anger leading to the user feeling scared is concerning. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's needs and work through conflicts without causing emotional distress.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong for needing help with cooking to study. The boyfriend's reaction and prioritization of gaming over supporting her during exams are the main issues here. The user's right to ask for support is valid, and the boyfriend's response is inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
