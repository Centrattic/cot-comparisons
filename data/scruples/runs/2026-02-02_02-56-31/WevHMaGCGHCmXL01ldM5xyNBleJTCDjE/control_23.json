I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong when their boyfriend is upset because she wants him to cook while she studies for exams. The boyfriend is in his \"push week\" for World of Warcraft, which is a major event in the game. The author says she told him to let her cook alone because he's scary when mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has six exams coming up, one the next day. Studying is crucial for her, and she might need the time to focus. On the other hand, the boyfriend is stressed about his in-game push, which he considers important. He's upset because he feels his time is being taken up by cooking instead of gaming.\n\nBut wait, the author is the one who initially wanted him to cook so she can study. That seems reasonable, especially with exams coming. However, the boyfriend is upset that he's being asked to prioritize her studies over his own important gaming time. The situation escalated to the point where the author now cooks for both to avoid a fight, and she mentions he scares her when angry. That's a red flag. If someone is making their partner feel scared, that's a serious issue, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author has a valid reason to need time for exams. The boyfriend's reaction being so intense that it scares her is concerning. It's possible that he's overreacting, but the fact that he's upset about time allocation might be valid if he's also under pressure. However, if his anger is causing fear, that's a problem. The author isn't wrong for needing time to study, but the boyfriend's response is problematic. The author shouldn't have to cook for both just to avoid conflict. Healthy relationships should support each other's priorities. If he's so invested in his game, maybe he should manage his time better, but the fear aspect is a bigger issue. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to study, but the boyfriend's behavior is the issue here.\n"
