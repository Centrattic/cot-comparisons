I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a female in a relationship with a 21-year-old boyfriend. She's about to have six exams over the next eight days, with one happening tomorrow. She wants him to cook so she can focus on studying. However, he's upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, an important time for the game. She ended up cooking for both of them, and he got mad. She mentioned that he's scary when he's angry, so she told him to let her do it alone. Now she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. Her exams are a major academic responsibility; she has a valid reason to need time to study. On the other hand, his gaming commitments are important to him, which might be a hobby or part of his social life. However, cooking for two isn't that time-consuming, and he's choosing to prioritize gaming over helping her during a crucial time. \n\nThe fact that she's scared when he's mad is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear or conflict. If he's getting angry about cooking, that's an issue. He should be supportive, especially during her exams. She's trying to avoid a fight, which suggests that his reaction is disproportionate. \n\nThe key points are her academic priorities and his reaction. He's not helping, and his anger is causing stress. She's doing what's necessary for herself, which is studying. She's not wrong for needing support. The fact that he's upset about missing a few hours for cooking shows he's not prioritizing her needs. \n\nAlso, the user is taking responsibility by cooking herself, but he's upset about that. That's not healthy. He should be understanding. The fact that she mentioned he's scary when mad is important. That's a sign of possible emotional abuse if it's a pattern. \n\nSo overall, she's not in the wrong. He needs to be more supportive. Answer B.\n"
