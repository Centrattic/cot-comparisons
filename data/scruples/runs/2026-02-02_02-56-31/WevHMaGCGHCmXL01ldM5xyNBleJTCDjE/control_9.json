      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong (AITA) in their situation with their boyfriend.\n\nSo the situation is that the author is a female, 18, and her boyfriend is 21. She wants him to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams in the next eight days, one of which is the next day. He's really mad at her because it's \"push week in WoW,\" which I think refers to a major event in the game World of Warcraft where players do a lot of activities to get rewards. She ends up cooking for both of them to avoid a fight. She told him to let her handle it because he was scaring her when he's angry. He says it's one of the most important weeks of the season for the game, so he can't miss it for a few hours to help with cooking. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is stressed about exams, which is a significant academic responsibility. She's asking her boyfriend to help with cooking, which is a reasonable request, especially if they're a couple sharing responsibilities. On the other hand, the boyfriend is also dealing with an important event in his gaming schedule. However, the key factors here are the urgency of the exams and the fact that one exam is the next day. The boyfriend's anger and the author feeling scared when he's mad are red flags. It's concerning if his reaction is causing her emotional distress.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual support are important. The author is trying to balance her academic responsibilities, which should be a priority. If the boyfriend is unwilling to compromise or support her during this critical time, that could indicate a problem in the relationship. However, the fact that she ended up cooking for both of them to avoid conflict shows she's trying to be accommodating. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might be disproportionate if helping with cooking for a few hours would allow her to study effectively. The fact that he's mad and she feels scared suggests that his response is more about his own priorities than considering her needs. In a healthy relationship, partners should support each other's important goals, even if it means adjusting their own schedules. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend's gaming event is genuinely a major commitment that he's been looking forward to, it's a two-way street. However, given the immediacy of the exam and the author's emotional state, the balance might tip in her favor. The key point is whether the boyfriend is being unreasonable in his expectations during a time when the author needs support. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because she's trying to prioritize her exams, which are crucial for her future. The boyfriend's refusal to help and the aggressive reaction could be the issue here. However, it's also possible that the author could have communicated better about her needs earlier, but since the exam is the next day, time is limited. The fact that she's handling the cooking now shows she's making sacrifices, but if the boyfriend's response is causing her distress, that's a bigger problem. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's in a high-stress situation with exams and the boyfriend's reaction is causing her fear, which is not acceptable.\n"
