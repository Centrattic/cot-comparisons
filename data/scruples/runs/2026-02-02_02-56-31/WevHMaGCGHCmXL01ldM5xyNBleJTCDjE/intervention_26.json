(One tmrw) He's super mad at me and the situation cause its push week in WoW apparently, and to avoid a fight I now cook for us both.\nNot much to say. I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a crucial week for his game, World of Warcraft. They ended up cooking for both, which the girlfriend didn't want to do. The key points here are about mutual respect and communication.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has six exams coming up, one tomorrow. That's a lot of pressure, and needing time to study is understandable. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in \"push week\" for WoW, which he considers very important. He's angry because he can't help with cooking during this time. The girlfriend then cooks for both, which she didn't want to do, and he's scaring her when he's mad.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's need to focus on exams is valid. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since he's the one who can't help. The girlfriend standing up for herself by saying he's scaring her is a red flag about the relationship's health. Maybe they need to communicate better about priorities and support each other, even if there's a conflict. Since the boyfriend isn't helping and is causing stress, the girlfriend isn't wrong for needing his support. So the answer might be B.\n"
