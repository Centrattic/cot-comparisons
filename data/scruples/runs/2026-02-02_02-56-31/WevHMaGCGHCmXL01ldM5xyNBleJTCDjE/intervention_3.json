(One tmrw) He's super mad at me and the situation cause its push week in WoW apparently, and to avoid a fight I now cook for us both.\nNot much to say. I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six exams coming up in eight days. The boyfriend is really upset because it's a big push week in World of Warcraft. Now, the user is the one cooking for both, and the boyfriend is mad. She says he's scaring her when he's angry. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The user has a lot of exams and needs time to study. It's a valid reason to ask for help with cooking, especially when time is limited. On the other hand, the boyfriend is committed to his game's push week, which might be important for him. But how important is a game compared to someone's exams? Exams can have long-term effects on a person's academic and career path.\n\nThe user is trying to communicate their need for study time, which is crucial. However, the boyfriend is not willing to compromise, leading to conflict. The user now cooks for both, which might not be fair if the boyfriend can't help. The fact that the boyfriend is getting so angry that the user feels scared is a red flag. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and support. If the boyfriend can't support her during a stressful time, that's an issue. \n\nAlso, balancing responsibilities in a relationship is key. Both should contribute to household tasks. If the boyfriend refuses to help and gets angry, that's a problem. The user isn't wrong for needing to focus on exams. It's reasonable to ask for help. The boyfriend should understand and adjust, even if it's inconvenient for him. So, the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
