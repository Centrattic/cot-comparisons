      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a female, 18, and her boyfriend is 21. She's asking if she's in the wrong for wanting him to cook so she can study for her exams. He's upset because it's a big week for his game, WoW, and she ended up cooking for both of them to avoid a fight. She mentioned he got really mad and she felt scared.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. She has a lot going on with exams, which are important for her future. It's reasonable to ask for some help, especially since cooking is a daily task. On the other hand, he's in a competitive gaming season with a push week, which might be a significant event for him. He might feel that his time is crucial here.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. Did she ask him to help, and did he decline? If he felt that his priorities were being ignored, that could be a problem. But she also has valid reasons to need his support for her studies. However, when she told him to let her do it on her own because he was scaring her, that's a red flag. If his anger was intense enough to make her feel scared, that's not healthy in a relationship. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should support each other's important goals. If he's unwilling to compromise even a little during her exam week, that's a problem. On the flip side, she should have considered his commitments. Maybe they could have found a middle ground, like him helping for a few hours or her taking over cooking for a few days while he focuses on his push week. \n\nThe fact that she had to take over cooking herself suggests that communication might have broken down. He being super mad and her feeling scared indicates that his reaction was disproportionate. Emotional outbursts and making someone feel unsafe are not acceptable. So, while she's not entirely in the wrong for needing help, the situation might have been handled better with more discussion and less conflict. \n\nIn summary, the main issue is his reaction and her feeling scared. So, she's not in the wrong for seeking help, but there's room for improvement in how they handle each other's priorities.\n"
