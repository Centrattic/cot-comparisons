I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a crucial time for his game, World of Warcraft. The user ended up cooking for both, but the boyfriend is mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has six exams coming up in eight days, which is a lot of pressure. It's reasonable to ask for help with chores to focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in a \"push week\" for his game, which he considers important. He might feel that taking time off to cook is a big deal for him.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned the boyfriend got super mad and is scaring them. That's a red flag. No matter the situation, someone shouldn't be making their partner feel scared. The user had to cook both meals, which might be a sign of imbalance. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning than the initial request. The user's priority is exams, which is a legitimate reason to need time. However, the boyfriend's response is problematic because he's being aggressive and not considering the user's needs.\n\nAlso, the user ended up doing all the cooking again to avoid a fight. That suggests the boyfriend isn't willing to compromise. Healthy relationships require communication and mutual support. The user isn't in the wrong for needing help; it's about balancing responsibilities. The boyfriend's inability to manage his own time during push week and his emotional reaction are issues. The user isn't the one being unreasonable here. The key point is the boyfriend's behavior, not the initial request. So the answer would be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
