I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's push week in his game, WoW. The user ended up cooking for both, avoiding a fight, but now the boyfriend is mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has a lot of exams coming up, which is a significant academic responsibility. It's reasonable to ask for help with chores, especially when under stress. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in a critical week for his gaming, which he might see as equally important. \n\nThe user mentioned that the boyfriend got so mad that she felt scared. That's a red flag. Communication is key in a relationship, and if one partner is causing fear, that's a problem. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate a lack of consideration for her academic needs. However, the user also chose to cook for both to avoid conflict, which shows she's trying to be accommodating.\n\nThe balance here seems off. While both have their priorities, the boyfriend's reaction is more concerning. The user isn't wrong for needing support during a stressful time. Relationships should involve mutual support, and if one partner is consistently prioritizing their own needs over the other's without empathy, that's an issue. \n\nBut maybe there's more context. The boyfriend might be under a lot of pressure too. However, the fact that he got so angry that it scared the user is a bigger problem. The user isn't in the wrong for asking for help. It's reasonable to expect partners to support each other, especially during exams. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the user isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the boyfriend's reaction and lack of support, not the user's request.\n"
