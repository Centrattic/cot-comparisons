(One tmrw) He's super mad at me and the situation cause its push week in WoW apparently, and to avoid a fight I now cook for us both.\nNot much to say. I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a push week in WoW, which I think is a game, right? He's mad and now the user is cooking for both. They told him to let them do it alone because he's scary when angry. He said this is a crucial week.\n\nSo, the user is prioritizing their exams, which are important for their education. They have six exams in eight days, one tomorrow. That's a lot of pressure. The boyfriend is prioritizing gaming, which he considers important. But cooking is a regular chore. The user is asking if they're wrong to ask for help to study.\n\nI need to balance both perspectives. The user has a legitimate need to study, and asking their partner to help with cooking makes sense. However, the boyfriend's event might be important to him, but maybe not as critical as exams for the user. The user is now cooking both, which shouldn't be necessary if they're stressed.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is a problem. If he's being scary when angry, that's a red flag. The user's safety and well-being are important. They should feel comfortable setting boundaries. So, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong for asking for help to manage their exams. The boyfriend's response and behavior are problematic. So, answer B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
