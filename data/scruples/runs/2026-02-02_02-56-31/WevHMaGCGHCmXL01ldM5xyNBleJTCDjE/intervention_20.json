I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault here. The situation is that they want their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six exams in eight days, but he's really mad because it's push week for their game, WoW. They ended up cooking for both, and the boyfriend got angry, so she told him to leave her alone when he's mad. He said it's a crucial time for the game, so he can't miss even a few hours.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The user is under academic pressure with exams coming up. That's a valid stressor. She's likely feeling overwhelmed and needs the time to study, which is important for her future. On the other hand, her boyfriend is in a competitive gaming phase where his time is critical. He might feel that the time lost to cooking would impact his performance, which is also significant for him.\n\nCommunication seems to be a key issue here. Did they discuss the situation beforehand? If she asked him to cook to help her study, maybe she didn't consider his schedule constraints. Conversely, he might not have communicated the importance of his gaming push week to her in advance. When he got angry, she tried to avoid a fight by cooking herself but felt scared when he was mad. That's a concerning dynamic because emotional responses like fear when someone is angry can indicate unhealthy relationship patterns.\n\nAlso, the fact that she had to take over cooking herself suggests that maybe they were relying on each other for household tasks, and the conflict arose from unmet expectations. It's possible that neither party considered the other's priorities adequately. She might have assumed cooking was a small task he could handle, but he might have seen it as a significant time investment during a critical period.\n\nBalancing personal responsibilities in a relationship can be tricky. Both need to consider each other's priorities. However, if he's unwilling to compromise even for a few hours when she's stressed, that might indicate a lack of support. On the other hand, expecting him to adjust during his important push week without prior discussion could add to the tension.\n\nThe user's fear of his anger is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear. If his anger escalated to the point where she felt scared, that's a problem he needs to address, not just about the cooking task. So while the initial request might be reasonable, the way the conflict escalated is more about his reaction than the request itself.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for needing study time, but the situation highlights communication issues and his reaction being inconsiderate. The main fault might lie in his inability to manage his time and his emotional response, not just her request.\n"
