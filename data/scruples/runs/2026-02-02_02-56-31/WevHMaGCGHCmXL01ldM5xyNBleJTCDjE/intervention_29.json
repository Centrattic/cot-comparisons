I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a big week for his game, WoW. The user ended up cooking for both now, but the boyfriend is mad.\n\nHmm. So first, the user has six exams coming up in eight days, one tomorrow. That's a lot of pressure. It makes sense they'd want to focus on studying. Cooking can be time-consuming, so asking their partner to take over that task seems reasonable. But the boyfriend is pushing back because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which he considers really important. He's not willing to miss even a few hours for cooking and cleaning.\n\nThe user mentioned that the boyfriend is \"super mad\" and that he's scaring her when he's angry. That's a red flag. If someone is getting to the point where they're scaring their partner, that's not healthy. The user stood up for herself by saying he needs to let her do it alone. But now she's taking over both their cooking, which might not be the best solution either.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend's priorities might not align with hers right now. On the other hand, if he's not being considerate of her exams and is being unreasonable, that's a problem. The fact that he's getting angry and not willing to compromise could indicate that he's not supportive, which is a bigger issue. The user isn't in the wrong for needing to focus on exams. Sacrificing a few hours of gaming to help with meals is a small ask, especially when it's during a stressful time for her. His reaction seems disproportionate. So, likely, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
