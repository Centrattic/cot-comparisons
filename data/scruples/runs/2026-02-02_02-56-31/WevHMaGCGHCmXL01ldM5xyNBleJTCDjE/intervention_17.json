I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a crucial week for his gaming activity, and the user ended up cooking for both, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, the user's main concern is preparing for important exams, which is a significant academic responsibility. They\u2019re seeking support from their partner during a stressful time. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is in \"push week\" for WoW, which seems important to him, possibly a competitive or time-sensitive event. The conflict arises when the user asks for help with cooking, but the boyfriend can't commit due to his own priorities.\n\nThe user mentioned that the boyfriend got angry and now she's cooking for both, which she's not happy about. She also said he scares her when he's mad. That's a red flag. A healthy relationship shouldn't involve fear or anger, especially over everyday tasks like cooking. \n\nThe boyfriend's inability to compromise or communicate effectively is a problem. Prioritizing gaming over helping with exams might seem trivial, but it's about mutual support. However, the user's need to study is time-sensitive and critical. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from his own stress about the game, but reacting negatively is not okay, especially leading to fear in the user.\n\nThe user isn't wrong for needing help during exams. It's reasonable to ask for support. The boyfriend's response indicates a lack of understanding and empathy. The fact that she now cooks for both suggests he wasn't willing to compromise, which isn't healthy. The key issue here is the boyfriend's reaction and the lack of respect for her needs, not the user's initial request. So, the answer would be B (No), the user isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the main problem here, especially the fear she feels when he's angry.\n"
