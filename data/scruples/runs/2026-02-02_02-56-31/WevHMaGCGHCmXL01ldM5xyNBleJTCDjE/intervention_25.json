I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook while they study for six exams in two weeks. The boyfriend is upset because it's a big week for his game, WoW push week, and the user ended up cooking for both, which made the boyfriend angry. The user says the boyfriend gets scary when mad and they had to assert themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has a lot of exams coming up, which is a significant academic pressure. Asking for help with cooking to focus on studying might seem reasonable. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in the middle of an important gaming event, which he might consider important too. The key here is communication and mutual respect.\n\nThe user mentioned that the boyfriend didn't help and got mad, leading the user to take over cooking. The boyfriend's reaction might be problematic, but the user's request isn't unreasonable. However, the user didn't cook for both initially; they were in a situation where they had to take over. The boyfriend's anger and the user feeling scared adds another layer. It might be that the boyfriend isn't supportive of the user's academic needs, which is important. \n\nBut the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user is prioritizing their studies, which is a major life event. The boyfriend's gaming push is also important to him, but maybe not as critical as exams affecting their future. However, relationships require compromise. Maybe the user could have found a middle ground, like cooking together or setting specific times. But the user's main issue is that they needed to study, and the boyfriend's refusal to cooperate led to conflict. \n\nThe user's statement about the boyfriend scaring them when mad is a red flag. Emotional or physical intimidation is not acceptable. But the question is about AITA. If the user asked for help and the boyfriend refused without considering their needs, the user isn't in the wrong. However, if the user didn't consider the boyfriend's priorities, maybe there's a balance. But given the circumstances, the user has a valid reason to need help with cooking for exams. The boyfriend's reaction seems excessive, so the user isn't the one at fault.\n"
