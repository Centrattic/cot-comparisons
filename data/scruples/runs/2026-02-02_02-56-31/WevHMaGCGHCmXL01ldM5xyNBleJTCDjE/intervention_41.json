      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six exams in eight days. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is a female, 18, and her boyfriend is 21. They're in a situation where she needs to study intensively, and she asked him to cook. He's upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which is a game. She ended up cooking for both to avoid a fight. He got angry, and now she's scared when he's mad. He says the week is important, but she needs time to study.\n\nSo, the main points here are about balancing responsibilities and mutual support in a relationship. The user is prioritizing her exams, which are crucial for her academic future. She's asking for help with cooking to manage her time for studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is focused on his game progress, which he considers important. However, when the user asked for his help, he was upset, and the argument led to her cooking both meals to avoid conflict. She also mentions feeling scared when he's angry, which is a red flag for emotional distress.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to support each other's goals. If the boyfriend is unwilling to compromise, especially when the user has a critical period, that could be an issue. Prioritizing one's studies is a significant responsibility, and expecting mutual help in daily tasks like cooking is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction being angry and causing her fear suggests that he's not handling the situation well. Healthy relationships involve communication and flexibility. If he's unable to adjust his priorities to support her during this time, that might indicate a problem in the relationship. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking support; the issue lies in the boyfriend's response and inability to manage his priorities.\n"
