I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is about their F18 girlfriend and M21 boyfriend. The girlfriend wants him to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams in the next eight days, with one exam tomorrow. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which is important for him. Now the girl is cooking for both because she wants to avoid a fight. She mentioned that when he's mad, he scares her, and he said it's one of the most important weeks of the season.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has exams coming up, which are important for her academic success. She's trying to focus on studying, so she's asking for help with cooking. On the other hand, the boy is stressed about his game, which he considers important. However, the girl is now cooking for both, which might be adding to her stress instead of helping her prepare for exams.\n\nThe key points here are mutual support in a relationship and communication. In healthy relationships, partners should support each other's important goals. If the boy is unwilling to help when the girl needs support for exams, that could be an issue. His reaction being so intense that she feels scared is a red flag. Emotional distress and feeling unsafe are serious matters. The fact that she had to take over cooking because of his anger suggests he isn't being supportive. \n\nThe boy's argument about the game's importance might be valid, but if his needs are prioritized over her exams and it's causing conflict, then there's a problem. The girl's request is reasonable\u2014she needs time to study, and expecting some help with chores is typical in a partnership. His refusal and the resulting conflict indicate he might be in the wrong here. The girl isn't at fault for needing to study and asking for support; the issue is his reaction and unwillingness to compromise, especially when it's affecting her well-being and academic goals.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
