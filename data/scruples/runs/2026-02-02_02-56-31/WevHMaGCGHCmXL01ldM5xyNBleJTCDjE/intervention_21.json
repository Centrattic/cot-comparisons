I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a female in a relationship with a 21-year-old male. She's facing finals week with six exams in eight days, one of which is tomorrow. She asked her boyfriend to help with cooking so she could study. He got really mad because it's \"push week\" in WoW, a game. Now she's cooking for both, and he's upset. She told him to let her handle it because he scares her when mad. He insists it's a crucial time he can't miss.\n\nSo, the main issue is about balancing personal responsibilities (exams) versus shared responsibilities (cooking). The user is stressed about exams, which are time-sensitive and important for her academic future. The boyfriend is focused on his gaming schedule, which he considers important. The conflict arises from differing priorities.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual support are key. The user is seeking support to study, which is a major academic commitment. The boyfriend's response being angry and making her cook instead could be seen as not supporting her during a critical time. However, he also has his own commitments. But when someone is in a high-stress situation like exams, partners usually adjust to help. The fact that he got mad and refused might be seen as not being considerate of her needs. Also, the user mentioned he scares her when angry, which is a red flag regardless of the situation. Emotional safety is important in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's commitment to his gaming might be important to him. But exams are a temporary phase with long-term consequences. It's a balance of what's more critical. If the user is the one in a time-sensitive, high-stakes situation, the partner might need to be more flexible. The user isn't asking for a long time, just a few hours for cooking. Cooking is a shared responsibility, so expecting him to help isn't unreasonable. However, if he's unwilling, maybe the user should handle it herself. But the boyfriend's reaction being angry and making her feel scared is problematic.\n\nThe key points here are the user's academic pressure, the boyfriend's refusal to compromise, and the emotional impact. The boyfriend not being supportive during her critical exam period could be seen as wrong. However, the user isn't asking for anything unreasonable. The boyfriend's anger and the fear it causes are significant issues. So, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting support, and the boyfriend's reaction is the problem. Therefore, the answer would be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
