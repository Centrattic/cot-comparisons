I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams, but now they're cooking for both because he's mad about a game event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has six big exams coming up, one the next day. That's a lot of pressure. It's reasonable for them to need time to study. Cooking can take time, especially if they're doing it for both of them. If the boyfriend is willing to take over cooking, that could help the user focus on studying. However, the boyfriend is in a \"push week\" for his game, which he says is crucial. \n\nNow, the user mentioned that when they told the boyfriend to cook, he got angry, and now she's cooking for both. She also said he's scaring her when he's mad. That's a red flag. No one should make their partner feel scared. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and communication. If he's upset, he should express it without causing fear.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems out of proportion if he's so committed to his game. Prioritizing a game event over helping his partner study might not be fair. But exams are also time-sensitive and important for the user's future. \n\nThe user isn't wrong for needing support during a stressful time. However, the boyfriend's response is problematic. The key here is the emotional aspect\u2014the user feeling scared. That's not acceptable in a relationship. So, while the user's request is valid, the boyfriend's reaction is not. The user isn't in the wrong for wanting help; the issue lies in how the boyfriend responded. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
