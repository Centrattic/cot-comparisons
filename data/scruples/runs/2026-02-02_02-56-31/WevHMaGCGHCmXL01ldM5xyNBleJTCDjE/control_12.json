I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author, a female 18-year-old, wants her boyfriend, a male 21-year-old, to cook so she can study for six exams in the next eight days, with one exam tomorrow. The boyfriend is upset because it's a major event in World of Warcraft called \"push week.\" They ended up in a fight, and now the author is cooking for both to avoid conflict. He mentioned it's a crucial time for the game and couldn't miss a few hours. The author says he scares her when he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason\u2014preparing for exams is important for her future. It's a short period (8 days) with a big exam coming up, so needing help is understandable. On the other hand, the boyfriend's game event is important to him, but is that as critical as someone's exams? Also, his reaction being angry to the point of scaring her is concerning. Healthy relationships should consider each other's needs and communicate without aggression. \n\nThe boyfriend's insistence on prioritizing gaming over helping her study, especially when she's stressed, might be seen as selfish. But the exams are a temporary, high-stakes situation. The boyfriend's reaction being angry and causing fear is a red flag. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other through important life events. If he's unwilling to compromise and it's causing fear, that's a problem. The author standing up for herself by saying he scares her is appropriate. \n\nSo, the author's request is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here. He's prioritizing a game event over her academic needs and reacting aggressively, which is not acceptable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
