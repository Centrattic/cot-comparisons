I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the user's question. The main issue here is a conflict between the user (F18) and her boyfriend (M21) about cooking. The user wants her boyfriend to cook so she can study for exams, but he's upset because it's a crucial week for his game, WoW. They ended up in a fight, and now she's cooking for both, but she's scared when he's mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The user is facing a significant academic challenge with six exams in eight days, one the next day. Preparing for exams is a major stressor, and having support in daily tasks like cooking would be a reasonable request. On the other hand, her boyfriend is in \"push week\" for WoW, which he considers one of the most important weeks of the season. For gamers, these events can be time-sensitive and require dedicated hours, which might be comparable to a work deadline or a project for someone else.\n\nThe user mentioned that when she asked him to cook, he got very mad, and she felt scared. That's a red flag. If his reaction was escalating to the point where she felt scared, that's a serious issue regardless of the situation. Healthy relationships should not involve fear or intimidation.\n\nThe boyfriend's refusal to help for a few hours seems to be causing more harm. The user is now taking on both cooking duties, which could add to her stress during a critical time. It's possible he's not considering her academic pressure and the importance of her exams. However, it's also possible he values his gaming commitments highly and feels they shouldn't be compromised.\n\nBut the key point here is the emotional response. If he's getting so upset that it's making her scared, that's a problem. Even if his reasons are valid, the way he's reacting is not healthy. The user's safety and emotional well-being are paramount. She shouldn't have to sacrifice her studies or feel afraid in a relationship.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both have valid needs. The user needs support for her exams, and the boyfriend has his gaming commitments. However, the boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate. Healthy relationships involve compromise and understanding. If he can't adjust a few hours for her exams, especially when she's clearly stressed, that's a sign of imbalance. Also, the fact that she now has to cook for both after he refused shows that he's not contributing equally, which isn't fair either.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The user isn't in the wrong for asking for help during a stressful time. The boyfriend's refusal and the resulting fear are the issues. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
