He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and point of sale system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake, but the friend disappeared after the work was done, not paying and cutting off contact. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many jurisdictions is still valid but can be harder to enforce. The author did the work, and the friend hasn't paid. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, and some of their code is still in use. Legally, the friend might owe payment, but without a written contract, it's tricky. However, the author having access to the domain and code could give them leverage, but using that to disrupt the company could be illegal, like sabotage or threatening business operations.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement and ghosted the author. The author feels wronged and is considering revenge. But taking actions like removing the website or disabling the POS system could be seen as harmful and possibly illegal, regardless of the grievance. Even if the author has a case, taking matters into their own hands might cross the line into criminal behavior, such as causing damage to property (digital or otherwise).\n\nAnother angle: the author has the legal right to the domain and hosting because they're in their name. If they remove access, they might be within their rights to reclaim their assets, but doing so in a way that disrupts the business could be considered extortion or theft, depending on the circumstances. Also, the code's ownership is a factor. If the author retains the copyright, they could potentially demand payment or a license fee, but destroying the work might not be the right approach.\n\nThe author might have valid claims for unpaid work, but the method of seeking redress is questionable. The appropriate legal recourse would be to file a lawsuit for breach of contract or unpaid services. Taking direct action to disrupt the company could lead to criminal charges or civil liability for damages caused. The author's anger and desire for revenge might cloud their judgment, leading them to act in a way that's illegal, even if they feel justified.\n\nIn summary, while the friend is clearly in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the company could be illegal and ethically problematic. The right approach is to pursue legal means to recover what's owed, not to take retaliatory actions that could cause harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such actions, even if the friend is at fault.\n"
