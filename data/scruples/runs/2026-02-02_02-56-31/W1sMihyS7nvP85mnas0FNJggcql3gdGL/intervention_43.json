  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their \"friend's\" successful company because he didn't pay them. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nSix years ago, the friend started a company and asked the user to design the website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement: $2000 plus 5% stake. The user worked on it, took time off other projects, and the friend ghosted them after completion. Now the company is worth millions, and the user is considering taking action because they weren't paid.\n\nThe user mentions they still have access to the domain, hosting, and some code. They're thinking of messing with the systems because they feel wronged. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, they're enforceable but hard to prove. The user might not have a strong legal case, but morally, they might feel entitled. However, taking action like disrupting the company could be illegal, even if the friend didn't pay. Hacking or sabotaging systems is a crime, regardless of the reason.\n\nThe user's friend might have considered the work done under a different understanding, maybe thinking the payment was the initial $2000 and the stake was just a gesture. Or maybe the friend had valid reasons for not paying, like the work not meeting expectations. But since the user isn't getting any payment, their frustration is understandable.\n\nHowever, the user's threat to disrupt the company's operations could lead to legal consequences for them. Even if they have access, misusing that access is illegal. There's a difference between being wronged and committing a crime in response. The user might not be in the moral wrong for feeling betrayed, but acting on it by causing harm could make them legally liable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the user is in the wrong if they act on their threat, because their actions would be unlawful, regardless of the prior dispute. They should seek legal recourse instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n"
