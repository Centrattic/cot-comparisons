  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they helped a friend start a company by designing a website and a point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. But the friend never paid and now the company is successful. The person is considering disrupting the company to get what they think is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, contracts for services under a certain amount (like under $500 or $1000) might be enforceable verbally, but for larger stakes, especially equity, it's harder. The person might have a case for the $2000, but the 5% stake without a written agreement could be problematic. Courts usually require written contracts for equity stakes to avoid disputes. So legally, the friend might not be obligated to pay the 5%, and the $2000 could be an issue if there's no proof of agreement.\n\nThen there's the ethics. The friend didn't pay and ghosted, which is pretty bad. The person feels wronged. But taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" could lead to legal trouble. Even if the friend is in the wrong, sabotaging the company could be illegal. They might be committing a crime like disrupting business or damaging property, especially since the domain and hosting are in their name. They might have rights to those, but intentionally breaking the systems could be considered theft or sabotage.\n\nAnother angle: the person still has control over the domain and code. They could legally pursue this through a court, maybe suing for the $2000 and any possible equity. But without a written contract, it's uncertain. If they go ahead with disrupting the company, they risk losing any leverage they have. The friend could countersue for damages if the sabotage caused losses.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect. The person lost a friend and feels betrayed. But revenge isn't a legal solution. Even if the friend is a jerk, the person needs to handle it through proper channels. Disrupting the business could backfire and land them in legal trouble, which would be worse.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, the person might not have a strong case for the equity, but there might be a case for the $2000. Ethically, the friend wronged them, but taking revenge through sabotage is not the right approach. The correct path is to seek legal advice and pursue a lawsuit if possible. Therefore, the answer is that they are in the wrong if they proceed with sabotage because it's illegal and they should use legal means instead.\n"
