  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's successful company. The situation is that six years ago, the friend asked them to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement with $2000 and a 5% stake. The user worked on it, but after finishing, they were ghosted. Now the friend is a millionaire with a multi-million-dollar company, and the user is thinking of taking actions like pulling domain access or using the code to disrupt the business.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court, depending on jurisdiction. But the user still has control over the domain and hosting, and the code. If they built the code without a contract transferring ownership, then technically they might still own the code. So if they remove access, that's their legal right. But is it ethical?\n\nEthically, the friend broke the verbal agreement, which is a problem. The user was promised payment and a stake but got nothing. The friend ghosted them, which adds to the betrayal. However, the user is now considering actions that could harm someone else's business. Even if they have a legal right, is it morally okay to disrupt a company, especially for revenge?\n\nThen there's the friendship aspect. They mention they just wanted the friend back initially, but now it's about the money. The friend didn't keep the agreement, but the user's response could be seen as taking it too far. Even if they have a claim, destruction might not be the best approach. What about trying legal channels first, like sending a formal demand or consulting a lawyer?\n\nAlso, the user has access to the domain and hosting. Legally, if they registered it under their name, they can take it down. But doing so could be seen as using their position for leverage. If the code is still being used without payment, the user might have a case for compensation, but sabotage could be excessive.\n\nSo, balancing legal rights and ethical considerations. Legally, the user might have a case, but ethically, taking down a business could be seen as disproportionate, even if the friend didn't honor the agreement. The user might not be in the wrong legally, but morally, it's a gray area. The friend's actions were wrong, but the user's potential actions could also harm innocent employees and others involved in the business.\n\nAlso, the user's motivation matters. If it's revenge, that's different from seeking rightful compensation. The answer might hinge on whether the actions are legal and proportionate. So, while the friend is at fault, the user's actions could be seen as wrong if they go beyond seeking what's owed and instead cause unnecessary harm.\n"
