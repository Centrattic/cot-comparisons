He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author did some work for a friend's company six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on the backend, and a designer did the frontend for $2000. The friend then ghosted them, didn't pay, and now the company is successful.\n\nThe author is considering disrupting the friend's company now. They still have access to the domain, hosting, and some code. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they do this.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, contracts for services over a certain amount need to be in writing. Since this was a verbal agreement, the author might have a hard time proving the terms in court. Also, if the code wasn't transferred properly, the author might still hold the rights. But depending on the jurisdiction, the fact that the work was done for a company might mean it's considered a work made for hire, which could transfer ownership automatically. However, since there was no formal contract, this is unclear.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement and ghosted the author. The author feels wronged. But seeking revenge by disrupting the company could lead to legal trouble. Even if the author has rights to the code, intentionally causing damage could be seen as malicious. The friend might have a defense if he can show that the terms weren't properly agreed upon or that ownership was transferred through usage over time.\n\nAlso, the author's actions could be considered unethical. Instead of pursuing legal avenues, they're planning to sabotage. Even if they have a case, resorting to sabotage could make them look like the villain. The friend's actions were definitely inconsiderate and dishonest, but the author's response might escalate things in a way that's not helpful.\n\nPossible outcomes: If the author does disrupt the company, the friend could sue for damages. The author might also lose any potential claims to payment or equity if their actions are deemed retaliatory. Legally, it's a gray area, but ethically, the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" might not be justified, even if they feel wronged.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong legally if they have valid claims, but ethically, their planned actions could be seen as wrong because retaliation isn't the right approach. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong if they do this. Considering both legal and ethical angles, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the disruptive action is not the appropriate way to handle the situation, regardless of past wrongs.\n"
