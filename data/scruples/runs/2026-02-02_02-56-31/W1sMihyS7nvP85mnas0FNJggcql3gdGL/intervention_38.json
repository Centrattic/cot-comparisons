  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's successful company over an old unpaid agreement. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there's a verbal agreement from six years ago where the user was supposed to be paid $2000 plus a 5% stake for designing a website and POS system. The friend ghosted after the work was done, and now the company is worth millions. The user hasn't been paid, and the friend is now retired and wealthy. The user is thinking about taking action to disrupt the company, possibly by removing their access or using the code they still own.\n\nSo, the main legal question here is about the enforceability of the verbal agreement. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they can be harder to prove without written evidence. The user might have a case for breach of contract if they can prove the terms existed. However, the friend might counter that there was no formal agreement, or that the terms were different.\n\nEthically, the situation is more complex. The user did work under a verbal agreement, which the friend didn't honor. The friend also cut off communication, which adds to the frustration. However, the proposed action\u2014disrupting the company\u2014could be seen as taking matters into one's own hands, which might not be the best approach. Legal action would be the proper route, but without a written contract, it's uncertain.\n\nThe user also mentions that they still own the domain, hosting, and some code. Legally, if the user hasn't transferred ownership, they might have the right to reclaim those assets. But using that to disrupt the company could lead to legal repercussions, like claims of sabotage or theft. Even if they own parts of the code, using it to cause harm might not be justified legally or ethically.\n\nAnother angle: the friend's actions could be considered fraudulent if they intentionally avoided payment. The user might have grounds to sue for the unpaid amount and damages. However, without written proof, it's risky. The user's threat to disrupt the company could be seen as blackmail or extortion if done with the intent to extort money.\n\nThe emotional aspect is also there. The user lost a friend and feels betrayed. But taking revenge by harming the friend's business might escalate the conflict and lead to more problems. It's important to consider the consequences, like potential legal action from the friend or loss of any future settlement.\n\nIn summary, while the user might have a valid claim, the method of seeking recompense by disrupting the company is likely to be seen as wrong both legally and ethically. The proper course would be to pursue legal channels, but the user needs to weigh the risks of their actions versus the potential benefits.\n"
