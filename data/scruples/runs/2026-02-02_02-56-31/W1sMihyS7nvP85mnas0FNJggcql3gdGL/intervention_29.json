  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user's friend started a company six years ago and asked them to design the website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement: $2000 plus a 5% stake. The user worked on it, put other projects aside, and even hired a designer who was paid up front but didn't get a stake. Then the friend ghosted them, stopped communicating, and now the company is successful with multiple stores. The user hasn't been paid, and now they're considering disrupting the friend's company because of the unpaid $2000 and potential millions in options.\n\nSo the question is whether the user is in the wrong if they decide to \"fuck his shit over.\" The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me think about the legal and ethical aspects here. First, the verbal agreement. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they can be hard to enforce because there's no written proof. The problem here is that the user didn't get paid, so there's a breach of contract. However, without a written agreement, proving the terms might be difficult. The user might have a case, but it's not clear how enforceable it is.\n\nOn the other hand, the user still has control over the domain and hosting, and some of their code is still being used. That could imply that the original terms about the stake and payment weren't fully fulfilled, so the user might have the right to some compensation. However, using that to disrupt the company could be considered unethical or illegal, depending on the actions taken.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement, which is wrong. But retaliating by disrupting the company could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. The user might feel wronged, but using their access to sabotage the company could lead to legal consequences, even if the friend was in the wrong initially. \n\nAlso, the user mentions that maintaining access to the domain and code might be a leverage point. However, if the original agreement was supposed to transfer ownership upon payment, and payment wasn't made, then the user might have a right to that. But if they use that to disrupt operations, it could be considered theft or sabotage, which is illegal.\n\nAnother angle: the user's actions could harm innocent employees or customers if the company's operations are disrupted. Even if the friend is at fault, the consequences of the user's actions might affect others unrelated to the dispute.\n\nSo, legally, the user might have a claim for the unpaid services, but enforcing it would be difficult without a written contract. Ethically, retaliating could be seen as justified in a way, but it's still likely to be considered wrong because it's not resolving the issue through proper channels. Sabotaging someone's business is generally frowned upon regardless of the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the user is in the wrong (A) because, even if the friend is at fault, taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the company is not a legally or ethically acceptable way to handle the situation. The proper course would be to pursue legal action if possible, but direct sabotage is not justified.\n"
