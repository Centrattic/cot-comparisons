  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's successful company. They had a verbal agreement six years ago where the friend promised payment and a 5% stake in exchange for designing the website and POS system. The user worked on it, but after completion, the friend cut off contact. Now, the company is worth millions, and the user is thinking of taking action to get their money and stake, even if it means disrupting the business.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, certain contracts (like those involving real estate or employment) need to be in writing to be enforceable. However, for services rendered, verbal agreements can sometimes hold up, but it's harder to prove. The user might not have a strong legal case unless there's evidence like emails, messages, or witnesses. The fact that the friend ghosted them complicates things because there's no written record.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The user provided significant work and was promised payment and equity. The friend didn't honor the agreement and has since become successful. The user's anger and feeling of betrayal are understandable. However, taking direct action to disrupt the company, like removing code or domains, could be seen as unethical or even illegal. Even if the user owns the domain and code, using that to sabotage the company could lead to legal repercussions, like claims of theft or sabotage.\n\nAnother point is the friendship. The user mentions they were close friends for 15 years, but the relationship deteriorated. The friend's actions of ghosting and not maintaining contact might have damaged the friendship beyond repair. The user's desire for both financial compensation and emotional closure is valid, but their method of addressing it could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the user currently has access to the domain and hosting, and parts of their code are still in use. Legally, if the user owns the code, they might have a claim to the intellectual property. However, using that as leverage to disrupt the business could be a gray area. It's possible the friend believes they have rights to the code now, even if the agreement wasn't formalized.\n\nThe user's anger is justified given the situation, but the potential consequences of their actions need to be considered. Sabotaging the company could lead to legal action against them. They might be better off seeking legal advice to pursue a claim for the unpaid services and equity. Alternatively, they could try to negotiate a settlement, though the friend's lack of communication makes that difficult.\n\nIn summary, while the user might have a valid case for not being paid, taking extreme actions to disrupt the company could make them legally liable. The ethical stance is more nuanced\u2014depending on the circumstances, they might feel justified, but the method of enforcement could be problematic. The answer hinges on whether their actions are legally defensible and ethically justifiable given the circumstances.\n"
