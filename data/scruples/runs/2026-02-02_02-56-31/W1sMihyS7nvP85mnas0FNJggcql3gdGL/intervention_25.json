  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's successful business because they weren't paid for their initial work. \n\nFirst, there's the verbal agreement. They had a gentlemen's agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. But since it's verbal, enforcing that might be tricky. Legally, verbal contracts can be valid but hard to prove, especially without any written evidence. The user might not have a strong legal case here.\n\nThen, the friend ghosted them. The user tried to reach out but got no response. The friend now is successful, with multiple stores and houses. The user still has control over the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. The friend hired someone else for maintenance, but the original work wasn't properly transferred.\n\nThe user is considering disrupting the business. The question is whether that makes them the wrongdoer. Legally, if the user still owns the domain and hosting, they might have the technical ability to do so, but intentionally disrupting a business is likely illegal, regardless of the circumstances. Even if there's a grievance, actions like this could lead to legal consequences like lawsuits for damages.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The user did the work and wasn't paid, which is unfair. But taking revenge by disrupting the business could cause significant harm. The user might feel wronged, but responding with sabotage could escalate the situation and potentially lead to criminal charges or civil liability.\n\nThe user also mentions that the friend didn't inform them about the wedding, which adds to the emotional hurt. However, personal grievances don't justify illegal actions. The user might need to explore legal avenues, like small claims court, if possible, to seek the money owed. Since there's a verbal agreement, they might need to gather evidence like messages or witness testimonies to support their claim.\n\nIn summary, while the user might have a valid claim for payment, taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the business is likely to make them legally and ethically at fault. They should consider legal steps instead of personal retaliation.\n"
