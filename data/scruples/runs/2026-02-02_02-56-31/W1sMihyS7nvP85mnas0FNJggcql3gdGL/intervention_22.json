  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's successful company because they weren't paid for their work six years ago. \n\nFirst, there's a verbal agreement where the friend promised $2000 and 5% stake in the company. The user did the work, but after finishing, the friend stopped communicating. Now, the company is worth millions, and the user hasn't received payment. The friend is retired, owns houses, and the user hasn't been invited to major life events like the wedding.\n\nThe user has legal access to the domain and hosting, and some of their code is still in use. They're considering taking action to disrupt the company. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. Depending on the jurisdiction, some contracts need to be in writing to be enforceable, especially for stakes in a company. The friend might not have intended to honor the verbal agreement, or maybe it's too old to pursue now. The user's actions to disrupt the company could lead to legal issues, like theft of intellectual property or sabotage. \n\nEthically, the friend didn't honor the agreement, which is unfair. But taking revenge by disrupting the business might be seen as crossing a line. Even if the friend is at fault, the user's response could be harmful and possibly illegal. \n\nThe user might have valid claims, but the way they're considering resolving it could make them at fault. They should probably seek legal advice to explore proper channels, like small claims court, rather than taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, while the friend is likely in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, the user's potential actions (sabotage) would make them at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, they're in the wrong) because their actions would be illegal and unethical, regardless of the original situation.\n"
