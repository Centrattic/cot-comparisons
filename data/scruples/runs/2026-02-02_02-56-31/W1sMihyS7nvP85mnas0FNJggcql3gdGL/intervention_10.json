He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their former friend's successful company. The situation involves a verbal agreement six years ago where they were supposed to be paid $2,000 plus 5% equity for designing a website and POS system. The friend didn't pay and now the company is worth millions. The user hasn't been in contact and is considering taking action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, certain contracts like those involving real estate or over a certain amount require written form. But for other things, they can be enforceable if there's evidence of the agreement. However, proving a verbal agreement can be hard. The user might have a case, but it's not certain. The friend might argue there was no formal agreement.\n\nEthically, the user did the work under the understanding of payment and equity. The friend didn't follow through, which is unfair. But the user is considering retaliatory actions that could harm the friend's business. Even if the user has legal claims, taking revenge by \"fucking his shit over\" could lead to legal trouble. For example, if the user owns the domain and code, they could legally sell or transfer them, but doing so maliciously might not be advisable. There's also the question of whether the user's actions would be considered extortion or sabotage, which could have legal consequences.\n\nThe user mentions they still have access to the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. Legally, if they didn't transfer ownership, they might retain rights. But using that to harm the business could be a gray area. The user might have a valid claim to payment but taking destructive actions could make them complicit in damaging someone else's property, which is illegal.\n\nAdditionally, there's the aspect of friendship. The user wanted the friendship back, but it was cut off. The emotional aspect is valid, but revenge isn't a solution. The user might feel wronged, but the best course of action is probably legal recourse rather than sabotage.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking what they believe is owed, but the method of seeking it (sabotage) is problematic. They should pursue legal means to claim their payment and equity, if possible. Disrupting the company would likely be illegal regardless of the grievance.\n\nSo, the answer is B (not in the wrong for the grievance, but the method is wrong). However, the user's consideration of sabotage is what's ethically and legally wrong. The question is whether they are in the wrong for disrupting. Since the answer is A or B, based on the options given, the correct answer is B because the user isn't in the wrong for having the grievance, but the action they're considering is inappropriate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for disrupting. Since the action is wrong, but the grievance isn't, the answer is B (they are not in the wrong for wanting to act on the grievance, but the action itself is wrong). Wait, but the question is phrased as \"Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\" referring to the act of disrupting. So if the action is wrong, then the answer is A. But the user's intent is based on a grievance. However, the question is about the act of disrupting, not the grievance itself. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for considering disruptive action, so answer A. But maybe the answer is B because the user isn't in the wrong for the initial agreement being broken. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-express: The user's grievance is valid, but the act of disrupting is not. So, are they in the wrong for the act? Yes, because that's illegal/immoral. So answer A. But if the question is whether the user is in the wrong for having the grievance, the answer is no. The question is whether they're in the wrong for the act of disrupting. So answer A.\n"
