He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company six years ago and had a verbal agreement with the author for website and POS design. The agreement was a $2000 payment plus a 5% stake. The author did the work as a recent graduate, put other projects on hold, and then was ghosted. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting his business.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. While they are legally binding in many cases, proving the terms can be difficult. The author has no written contract, which might make it hard to enforce the payment or equity terms. However, the author still owns the domain and hosting, and the code is their property. If they created the work as an independent contractor, they might retain copyright unless there's a written assignment. So, the author could have legal rights to the code and domain, which they control.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The friend ghosted and didn't pay, which is clearly unethical. The author provided significant work and was left without compensation or communication. However, the proposed action is to \"fuck his shit over,\" which sounds like sabotage. Even if the author has legal rights, retaliating in a harmful way could be seen as morally wrong. The author might feel wronged, but taking actions to disrupt the company's operations could cross a line.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the author lost a friend and felt betrayed. But using their position to damage the company, even if justified in their mind, might not be the right approach. There could be legal repercussions if the sabotage is discovered, and it could create more conflict. Maybe the author should consider legal action instead of direct retaliation.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions were inconsiderate and possibly illegal if they breached the verbal contract. The author might have legitimate claims. But the method of seeking justice by disrupting the business is questionable. It's a grey area. Legally, the author might have standing, but ethically, taking destructive actions might not be the best course.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author might not be in the wrong legally if they have valid claims to the code and domain, but ethically, retaliating by disrupting the business could be problematic. The answer hinges on whether actions taken are proportionate and legal. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering the potential for legal action versus sabotage, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the friend's breach is clear, but the author's method of response is questionable. However, the author's actions to disrupt could be seen as justified if they're asserting their legal rights, but if it's malicious sabotage, then it's not. The scenario says \"completely fucked his shit over,\" which implies harmful actions, making the author in the wrong. But the initial contract breach is the friend's fault. Hmm. The answer might be B because the friend was at fault, but the author's actions might still be wrong. Alternatively, if the author is acting within their legal rights to reclaim assets, then maybe not in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. Given the options, the answer is likely B.\n"
