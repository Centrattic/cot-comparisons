He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted him, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, contracts for services over a certain amount need to be in writing to be enforceable. Since the author is talking about a 5% stake, which could be significant, a verbal agreement might not hold up in court. So legally, the author might not have a strong case. The friend could argue there was no formal agreement, and without evidence like emails or witnesses, it's hard to prove the terms.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author did the work expecting payment and equity, but the friend didn't follow through. The author feels wronged, which is understandable. However, taking revenge by disrupting the company (like taking down the website or POS system) is illegal and could lead to criminal charges. Even if the author owns the domain and hosting, using that to sabotage a business could be considered theft or sabotage. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is now retired and successful, so there's a sense of betrayal and anger. But the author's actions would be harmful and could lead to legal trouble. Instead of seeking revenge, the author should consider legal options like small claims court if there's any evidence of the agreement. But if there's no written proof, it's a tough case. \n\nThe fact that the author still has access to the domain and code might mean they have some leverage, but using that for revenge is not the right approach. It's about whether the ends justify the means. Even if the friend is at fault, sabotaging his business is not a justified response.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is wrong to consider disrupting the company. Legally, their case is weak without written proof, and ethically, taking such actions would be wrong. The correct path would be to seek legal advice and possibly pursue the debt through proper channels, but not to act out in revenge.\n"
