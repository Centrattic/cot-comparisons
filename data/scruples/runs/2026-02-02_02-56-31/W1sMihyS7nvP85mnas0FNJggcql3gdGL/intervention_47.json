  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's successful company. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, there was a verbal agreement six years ago. The user designed a website and POS system for their friend's startup. The agreement was $2000 plus 5% stake. But the friend ghosted after the work was done and never paid. Now, the company is worth millions, and the user is thinking about taking action to get what they believe is owed.\n\nSo, the key points here are: verbal agreement, no formal contract, work done but not paid, friend is now successful, user still has control over domain and code. The user is considering disrupting the company's systems to get their money and stake.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, verbal agreements can be enforceable, but it's harder to prove without evidence. The user might have a case, but if they take action like removing their code or taking down the website, that could be illegal. Even if they're owed money, taking matters into their own hands could lead to legal trouble for the user, like charges of sabotage or theft.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The friend broke the agreement, which is wrong. But taking revenge by disrupting the company might not be the best approach. It could be seen as justified in some ways because the friend didn't honor the deal, but it's still harmful and possibly illegal.\n\nThe user also mentions still having control over the domain and code. If they remove access or alter the systems, they could be committing a crime, regardless of the original agreement. The friend might have a legal case against them for damages if they disrupt the company.\n\nSo, the user is probably in the wrong if they go through with the plan. Even if the friend was dishonest, the user's actions would be illegal and unethical. The right approach would be to pursue legal channels, like small claims court, to seek the payment and stake they were promised. Taking direct action could backfire legally and morally.\n"
