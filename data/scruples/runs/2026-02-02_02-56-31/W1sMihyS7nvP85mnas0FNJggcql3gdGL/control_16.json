He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of this \"Would I Be Terrible For...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company, asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus 5% stake, but the author wasn't paid and now the friend is successful and ignoring them. The author is considering disrupting the friend's company because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects here. The main issue is the verbal agreement. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be legally binding, but they can be tough to enforce because there's no written evidence. The problem here is that the friend hasn't paid the agreed amount, and the author is holding onto the domain and code. \n\nThe author mentions that the domain and hosting are in their name, and some of their code is still in use. If the author were to take action, like shutting down the website or the POS system, that could be illegal. Even if there's a dispute over the code, intentionally disrupting someone else's business could lead to legal consequences like theft of service, sabotage, or other charges. \n\nEthically, the author is upset about being ghosted and not being paid. But taking revenge by disrupting the company might not be the right approach. There are legal avenues to pursue, like small claims court or sending a demand letter through a lawyer. However, the author's actions could be seen as retaliatory and malicious, which is ethically questionable regardless of the situation.\n\nAlso, the author might have some legal standing to claim payment, but using sabotage as a method is not appropriate. The friend's current business success might mean that the company has grown beyond the original work, but the author's contribution was part of that foundation. However, taking down the systems now could harm the stores and employees, which is another ethical concern.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in a tough spot where they have a potential legal claim but are considering illegal and unethical methods to enforce it. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company.\n"
