  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they would be in the wrong for disrupting their friend's successful company after a six-year-old verbal agreement was broken. The friend asked them to build a website and POS system in exchange for $2000 and 5% of the company. The work was done, but the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and now the company is doing well with multiple stores.\n\nFirst, the verbal agreement is a big point. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them can be difficult. The user has some evidence like the domain and hosting being in their name, and their code still in use. That might help if they wanted to pursue legal action.\n\nThe friend's actions\u2014ghosting, not communicating, and not paying\u2014definitely sound unethical and possibly illegal. The user put their other projects on hold, worked for eight weeks, and now hasn't been compensated. The friend also hired a designer who was paid upfront, which highlights the discrepancy in treatment.\n\nHowever, the user is considering taking retaliatory action by \"fucking his shit over.\" This could involve anything from destroying the website to sabotaging the POS system. Legally, tampering with someone else's property or business operations is a criminal offense, regardless of the prior issues. Even if the user has legal claims for unpaid services, taking matters into their own hands isn't the solution. \n\nEthically, while the friend's actions were wrong, the user's proposed retaliation would cause harm and could lead to legal trouble. The right approach would be to seek legal recourse through the proper channels, like suing for breach of contract or sending a cease-and-desist letter. \n\nThe user's frustration is understandable, but taking revenge could lead to more problems. They might have valid claims, but they need to handle it legally. Disrupting the company would be illegal, making them at fault, regardless of their grievances.\n"
