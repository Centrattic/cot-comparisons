  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they helped a friend start a company by designing a website and a point-of-sale system. They had a verbal agreement for payment and a 5% stake, but the friend never paid them and now the company is super successful. The person is considering disrupting the company to get their money and stake back.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, contracts for services can be verbal, but proving the terms might be hard. The person mentions they have access to the domain and hosting, and some of their code is still in use. If they take down the website or disrupt the POS system, that could be illegal. Even if they own the domain, shutting it down without notice might cause harm, which could lead to legal issues like sabotage or breach of contract.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The friend ghosted them and didn't follow through on the agreement. The person feels wronged and is upset about not being paid or acknowledged. But retaliating by disrupting the company could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. Ethically, is it right to harm someone's business even if they were wronged? Maybe there are better ways to handle it, like sending a demand letter or seeking legal action. \n\nAlso, the person mentions that the friend hired someone else to maintain the systems, and not much of the original work is left. So maybe the friend has already moved on, and the original code isn't as critical anymore. But if they do have access and take action, could they be held responsible for any damage? \n\nAnother angle: the person might have intellectual property rights over their code. If they didn't sign away those rights, they could potentially claim ownership and demand compensation through legal channels. However, using that as a leverage to disrupt the business could be crossing a line. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the person might have a case but taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the company could lead to legal trouble. Ethically, while the friend was wrong, retaliating might not be the best approach. The answer would likely be that they are in the wrong (A) because disrupting the company could be illegal and unethical, even if the original agreement wasn't honored.\n"
