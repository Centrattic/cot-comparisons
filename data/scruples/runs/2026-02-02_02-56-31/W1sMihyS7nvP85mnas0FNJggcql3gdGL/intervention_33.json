  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break down the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the user and their friend started a project six years ago. The friend asked the user to design a website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus a 5% stake in the company. The user worked on it for two weeks and then another six weeks for tweaks. The friend hired a designer who was paid $2000 upfront but didn't get a stake. \n\nThe user finished the work, but then their friend ghosted them. They didn't get payment or any communication beyond superficial social media interactions. Now, the friend is successful, owns two houses, has six stores, and is a millionaire. The user hasn't been paid, and they're considering disrupting the friend's business because of the unpaid $2000 and potential millions in options.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong if they disrupt the friend's company. Let's look at legal and ethical angles.\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts are enforceable, but proving the terms (like the 5% stake) might be difficult without written evidence. The user might not have a strong legal case if they can't prove the agreement. However, if the code is still in their name and they still own the domain and hosting, they might have some legal rights over those assets. Destroying or disabling them could lead to legal consequences, like being sued for damages. \n\nEthically, the user feels wronged because they believe they were promised payment and a stake. However, their plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is a form of revenge, which is ethically questionable. Even if they were wronged, taking retaliatory actions can cause more harm and might not be justified. \n\nAnother angle is the friend's actions. Ghosting and not communicating is poor behavior, but that doesn't necessarily give the user the right to retaliate in a harmful way. \n\nThe user might have options like sending a formal demand letter or seeking legal advice to reclaim what's owed. But taking direct action by disrupting the business could be illegal and might result in criminal charges if it involves hacking or sabotage.\n\nIn summary, while the user might have a case in terms of the original agreement, the method of seeking retribution could put them in legal trouble and make them ethically wrong for taking revenge instead of pursuing legal avenues.\n"
