He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for potentially disrupting their former friend's successful company. The situation started with a verbal agreement six years ago where they were supposed to be paid $2,000 plus 5% equity for designing a website and POS system. However, the friend ghosted them after the work was done and hasn't paid or acknowledged them since. Now, the company is worth millions, and the user is considering taking action to reclaim what they believe is theirs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. While they are legally binding in many jurisdictions, enforcing them can be difficult without evidence. The user mentions having access to the domain and hosting under their name, and parts of their code are still in use. This could be a point in their favor if they want to claim ownership or seek compensation. However, depending on the local laws, the passage of time might affect their case. There could be a statute of limitations on contract claims, which varies by location. If the user is thinking of taking legal action now, they need to check if they're still within that window.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The user worked on the project, put in significant time and effort, and was promised payment and equity. The friend didn't follow through, which is clearly a breach of the agreement. The user's frustration is understandable, especially after being ghosted and not receiving any communication. However, taking extreme actions like \"fucking his shit over\" could be seen as revenge rather than a legitimate claim. Even if the user has a legal case, resorting to sabotage might cross ethical lines and could have legal repercussions of their own, like intentional interference with business operations.\n\nAnother point to consider is the current state of the relationship. The friend has moved on, gotten married, and the user wasn't even invited, indicating a complete severance. The user might feel wronged, but seeking justice through legal means would be more appropriate than taking matters into their own hands. Disrupting the company could lead to criminal charges or civil liability, which would complicate things further.\n\nAlso, the user still has access to the domain and hosting. They could potentially negotiate or take legal steps to reclaim what's owed, perhaps through a lawsuit or mediation. However, they need to assess the feasibility of such actions. If the friend is now a millionaire, the user might have a stronger case, but they need to gather evidence of the verbal agreement, their work, and the terms agreed upon. Without written proof, it's going to be challenging, but not impossible. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the friend is in the wrong for not fulfilling the agreement, the user's response must be measured. Sabotage or disruption is unlikely to be justified, even if they feel wronged. The appropriate course of action would be to pursue legal remedies rather than taking revenge, which could harm their own reputation and lead to legal issues.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the user isn't in the wrong for feeling betrayed or for seeking compensation. However, the method they're considering\u2014disrupting the company\u2014is problematic. They should explore legal avenues instead. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong), but with the caveat that their approach needs to be legal and measured.\n"
