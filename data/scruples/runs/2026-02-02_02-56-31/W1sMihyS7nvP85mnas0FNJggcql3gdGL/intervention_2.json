  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their former friend's successful company. The situation started six years ago when the friend asked them to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The user worked hard, put other projects aside, and the friend ghosted them after the work was done. Now the friend is successful, and the user is thinking about taking action to get what they believe they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. A verbal agreement can be enforceable, but it's tough without evidence. The user mentioned it was a \"gentlemen's agreement\" known only to them. If there's no written proof, proving the terms in court would be challenging. The user might not have a strong legal claim, especially if they can't demonstrate the agreement's existence.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The friend didn't pay and cut off contact, which is really hurtful. The user feels wronged, and their actions (like taking down the website or POS) could be seen as revenge. But is that justified? Ethically, some might argue that the user has a right to seek compensation, but using disruptive methods could be seen as excessive, even if the friend was in the wrong.\n\nThe user still has control over the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. Legally, if the user holds intellectual property rights, they might have grounds to demand payment or a license fee. However, taking down the systems could disrupt the business and affect employees or customers, which complicates things.\n\nAlso, the user's emotional response is understandable. Being ghosted and not getting acknowledgment is painful. But acting out of anger might lead to legal consequences, like being sued for damages. The friend might retaliate, claiming the user breached confidentiality or caused harm intentionally.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, the user's response could be seen as harmful. Disrupting a business that's now successful might be considered disproportionate, especially if the user's goal is financial gain rather than just seeking justice for the original agreement.\n\nSo, putting it all together. Legally, the user's position is shaky without proof. Ethically, their anger is valid, but the method of response could be problematic. The answer would be that they are in the wrong (A) because their actions, while understandable, might be legally and morally questionable. However, if the question is about the friend being in the wrong, the answer is different. But the user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering the disruption. Given that, the answer is A.\n"
