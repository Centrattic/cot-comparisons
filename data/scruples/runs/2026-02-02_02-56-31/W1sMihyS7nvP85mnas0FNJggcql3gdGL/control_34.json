He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing the website and point of sale system six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% equity. The friend didn't pay, ghosted them, and now the company is super successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get their money and equity.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. A verbal agreement can be enforceable, but it's usually harder to prove. Since there's no written contract, the friend might not be legally obligated to pay. But the author did the work, and the friend is using their code and systems without compensation. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, which gives them some leverage.\n\nEthically, the friend betrayed trust by not paying and cutting off contact. The author feels wronged, which is understandable. But the proposed action\u2014disrupting the company\u2014is a big deal. Even if the author feels entitled, using sabotage could be illegal. Destroying someone's business property is likely a criminal act, regardless of the circumstances. \n\nAlso, the author has other options, like sending a demand letter, negotiating, or taking legal action. Sabotage is a drastic and unethical response. Even if the friend is in the wrong, the author's actions would be harmful and potentially illegal. So, while the friend's behavior is bad, the author's plan crosses into wrongdoing. The correct answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company.\n"
