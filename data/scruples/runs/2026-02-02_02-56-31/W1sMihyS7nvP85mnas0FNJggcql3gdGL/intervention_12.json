He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for potentially disrupting their friend's successful company. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, there was a verbal agreement six years ago where the friend asked the person to design a website and POS system. The agreement was supposed to be $2000 plus a 5% stake. The person worked on it, took time off other projects, and the work was done. Then the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and eventually became successful. Now the person is considering messing up the company's systems because they feel wronged.\n\nSo, the main points here are the verbal agreement's validity, the friend's actions, and the potential retaliation. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, they're legally binding but hard to enforce without proof. The friend didn't pay and cut off contact, which is definitely a breach. But the person is thinking about disrupting the company now, which could be illegal and unethical.\n\nThe person still has control over the domain and hosting, and parts of their code are still in use. They might have legal rights to that code since they weren't paid and didn't transfer ownership. But if they sabotage the systems, they could be committing a crime like sabotage or theft. Even if they have a valid grievance, taking matters into their own hands by disrupting a business is likely not the right approach.\n\nLegally, the friend likely owes them payment, but the person shouldn't retaliate illegally. They should pursue legal avenues, like small claims court if possible. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong, not just the legal aspect. Ethically, causing damage to the company for revenge, even if they were wronged, is probably not justified. It's better to seek legal recourse rather than taking destructive actions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person is not in the wrong for having a valid claim, but they would be in the wrong if they actually go through with disrupting the company. The answer depends on whether they act on their threat. But the question is whether they are in the wrong in the scenario presented, which includes the intention to disrupt. Therefore, the answer is B (No), because their friend breached the agreement, but they shouldn't take illegal actions. However, the act of planning to disrupt is wrong, so maybe it's A. Wait, the question is whether they're in the wrong if they disrupt the company. If they do, then yes, that's illegal and unethical. But if they're just considering it, the answer is about whether the action would make them wrong. The original question is phrased as \"Am I in the wrong if I disrupt...?\" So if they do it, they are in the wrong. But the user is asking if they are in the wrong in the scenario where they do it. So the answer would be A (Yes, they are in the wrong) because disrupting a company is wrong, regardless of the prior breach. Alternatively, if the question is whether they are justified, but the options are A for yes (they are in the wrong) and B for no. The correct answer would be A because even if the friend was in the wrong, the person disrupting the company would be committing a crime and thus in the wrong.\n"
