  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're wrong for considering disrupting their former friend's successful company because they weren't paid as agreed. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, there was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% in a company. The user did the work, but the friend ghosted them. Now the company is worth millions, and the user feels entitled to the payment. However, they're thinking about taking drastic actions to disrupt the company, which is illegal.\n\nSo, the key points here: verbal agreements can be legally binding but are hard to enforce. The user might have a case for the $2000, but the 5% stake could be more complicated without a written contract. Also, the user still controls the domain and hosting, which they might be using to threaten the company.\n\nThe question is about whether the user is in the wrong. Legally, taking revenge through sabotage is definitely wrong. Even if they have a claim, they should pursue legal avenues, not illegal ones. Also, the user's actions of disrupting the company would be criminal, regardless of the dispute. Additionally, the friend's actions of not paying could be considered breach of contract or fraud, but that's separate from the user's response.\n\nThe user might have valid grievances, but their proposed solution (disrupting the company) is unethical and illegal. The answer here is that they are in the wrong because they're considering illegal actions, even if the original situation was unfair. They should seek legal counsel to address the payment issues instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n"
