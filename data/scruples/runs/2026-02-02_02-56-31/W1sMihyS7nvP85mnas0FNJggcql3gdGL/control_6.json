He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author did the work, but then the friend ghosted them. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get what they think is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, for certain types of contracts, like those involving real estate or employment, a written contract is required. But for services, a verbal agreement might be legally binding, though hard to prove. The author has no written proof of the 5% stake or the $2000 payment. The friend might not even remember the agreement, or there could be a misunderstanding. Without evidence, it's hard to enforce such a claim.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author worked on the project, put in time and effort, and was promised payment and equity. The friend didn't follow through, which is unethical. However, the author's response of considering \"fucking his shit over\" (probably meaning sabotage) is also ethically questionable. Even if the friend wronged them, taking revenge through sabotage could cause harm beyond just getting payment, affecting employees, customers, etc.\n\nThe author still has access to the domain and code, which they might have a legal claim to since they weren't paid for exclusive rights. But using that access to disrupt the company could lead to legal trouble for the author. They might be seen as committing a crime like sabotage or theft, regardless of their original grievance.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is retired and owns two houses. Maybe the author wants financial compensation, but disrupting the company might not be the best way to get it. They might need to pursue legal action, like small claims court, if they can prove the agreement existed. But without documentation, that could be difficult.\n\nThe emotional aspect is there too. The author lost a friend and feels betrayed. But acting out of anger and hurt might lead to decisions that are impulsive and harmful. It's important to consider whether there's a better, more constructive way to resolve this.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were wrong, the author's plan to disrupt the company is not justified. They should seek legal advice to explore their options instead of taking matters into their own hands. Sabotage would likely make things worse legally and ethically.\n"
