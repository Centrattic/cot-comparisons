He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they helped a friend start a company by designing a website and POS system six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, contracts for stakes in a company might need to be in writing to be enforceable. So maybe the 5% stake isn't legally binding. The $2000 payment is a smaller amount, but again, a verbal agreement might not hold up in court. The author might not have a legal claim, which complicates things.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement. The author worked hard and then was ghosted. That's pretty unfair, and the friend is now successful without compensating them. But the author is thinking of \"disrupting\" the company, which could mean sabotaging it. That's a serious action with potential legal consequences. Even if the author feels wronged, sabotaging someone's business is illegal, regardless of the situation.\n\nAlso, the author still has control over the domain and hosting. Maybe they could legally take action like shutting down the site temporarily or demanding payment. But actively causing harm beyond that (like deleting data or making systems inoperable) would be illegal. So while the friend is in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, the author's plan crosses into illegal territory.\n\nAnother angle: the author hasn't pursued legal action yet. Maybe they should try sending a demand letter or going to small claims court if possible. Disruption through legal means would be better than taking matters into their own hands. The author's anger is understandable, but the proposed action is not the right way to handle it.\n\nIn summary, even though the friend is at fault for not paying, the author's plan to disrupt the company is illegal and unethical. The right approach would be to seek legal recourse if possible, but taking direct action to sabotage is wrong. So the answer is A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
