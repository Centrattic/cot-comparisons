  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the user to design their website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The user worked on it, but after finishing, the friend ghosted them. Now the company is successful, and the user is considering disrupting it to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, contracts for services can be verbal, but proving the terms might be hard. The user mentions a \"gentleman's agreement,\" but since there's no written contract, it's hard to enforce. The friend not paying could be a breach, but without evidence, it's tough. The user still has control over the domain and hosting, and some code is still in use. If they remove access or the code, that could be illegal, like sabotage or theft of intellectual property.\n\nEthically, disrupting a company, even if wronged, is usually seen as wrong. Retaliation can lead to legal consequences. The user might feel wronged, but taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" isn't the right approach. They should consider legal avenues, like small claims court if they can prove the agreement. However, since six years have passed, there might be a statute of limitations depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nAlso, the user's actions could backfire. If they remove access to critical systems, it could be considered a criminal act, leading to charges. The friend's success might make the user want justice, but legal action is the proper way. The user might not be in the wrong for the original agreement breach, but taking destructive actions now would make them wrong. They should consult a lawyer to explore options without resorting to sabotage.\n"
