  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the narrator to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% of the company. The friend ghosted after the work was done and now is successful. The narrator is considering disrupting the friend's company because they feel wronged.\n\nFirst, the key points here. There's a verbal agreement, which in legal terms might be tough to enforce because it's not written. The friend didn't pay anything and took away contact. The narrator still has control over the domain, hosting, and some code. The question is whether the narrator is in the wrong if they decide to disrupt the company.\n\nLegally, without a written contract, proving the agreement might be difficult. But ethically, the friend didn't honor the terms of the agreement. The narrator did the work, and the friend didn't pay or acknowledge the agreement. The narrator hasn't been paid and the code is still being used. However, taking action by \"fucking his shit over\" could be seen as revenge and potentially illegal, like hacking or sabotaging a business. Even if the narrator feels wronged, taking down the company could have legal consequences. So, while the friend might be in the wrong ethically, the narrator's actions might be illegal. The right approach would be to seek legal advice to pursue what's owed, rather than taking matters into their own hands. So, the answer would be that the narrator is in the wrong because they're considering illegal actions regardless of the friend's ethical faults.\n"
