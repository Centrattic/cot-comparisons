He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't pay, ghosted the author, and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky because they're hard to prove. The author mentions it's a gentleman's agreement, which isn't legally binding. So if there's no written contract, the friend might not be legally obligated to pay. But maybe there's some evidence, like emails or messages, that could help. Without that, the author might not have a strong case in court.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author worked a lot on the project, put other projects aside, and the friend didn't pay. It's frustrating, especially since the friend is now successful. But disrupting the company by taking down the site or messing with the POS system could be considered unethical or even illegal. The author has access to the domain and hosting because they're in their name, which could be a security risk. But even if they own the domain, the company might have legal claims against them if they tamper with it. Also, the POS system being used in stores could cause significant issues if the author does something to it, which might be seen as sabotage.\n\nAnother point is the friendship. The author wanted their friend back, but the friend cut off contact. The friend's actions were hurtful, but revenge through corporate disruption might not be the right approach. The author's anger is understandable, but taking actions like deleting data or causing system failures could lead to legal consequences, even if they were promised a stake. The friend's current use of the author's code without permission might be a separate issue, but the author's response could be over the line.\n\nAlso, the author could consider legal options first\u2014like sending a formal letter or going to small claims court if they can prove the agreement existed. However, given the time that's passed (six years), there might be a statute of limitations on the claim, depending on the jurisdiction. If the statute has expired, the author might not be able to recover the money through legal means.\n\nIn terms of morality, the friend's behavior was wrong, and the author has valid reasons to be upset. But the author's potential actions of disrupting the company could be seen as revenge rather than justice. Sabotage is generally not acceptable, even if one feels wronged. The author might have the right to be compensated, but taking matters into their own hands could make them legally liable for damages. It's important to consider that while the friend is in the wrong, the author's response could also be problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling wronged, but their proposed actions (disrupting the company) are likely illegal and unethical. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), because even if the friend broke the agreement, the author's response is not appropriate. Alternatively, if the author is just considering their rights and not taking action yet, but the question is about the wrongness of disrupting the company, then the answer is A. But the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The writer is considering taking destructive actions which are illegal, so they would be in the wrong. Hence, answer A.\n"
