He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after completion, the friend ghosted him. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting his business to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many places is still a valid contract, but proving it can be tough. The author did the work, but since there's no written contract, the friend might not be legally obligated to pay. However, the author still owns the domain and hosting because they're in his name. That's a point in the author's favor regarding property rights.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement and the trust. The author invested time and effort, expecting payment and a stake. The friend's ghosting and lack of communication are problematic. But the author is considering disrupting the friend's business, which is illegal. Even if the author feels wronged, sabotaging the business would be illegal and unethical, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is clearly illegal. Even if the friend is in the wrong, the author can't take matters into his own hands. The right approach would be to seek legal recourse, like small claims court, especially since there's evidence like the domain and hosting in the author's name. Disruption tactics like taking down the website or data would be criminal acts, such as hacking or sabotage.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because their planned action is illegal and unethical. Even though the friend broke the agreement, the author's response is not justified. The correct course is to pursue legal avenues, not retaliation.\n"
