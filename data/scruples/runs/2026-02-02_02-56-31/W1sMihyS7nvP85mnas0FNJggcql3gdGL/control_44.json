He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original question is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their former friend's company. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The friend started a company six years ago and had a verbal agreement with the author to design the website and POS system. The agreement was supposed to be $2000 plus 5% equity. The author worked on it, put other projects aside, and the friend then ghosted them, never paying and cutting off communication. The friend is now successful, with multiple stores and wealth, while the author hasn't been paid. The author still has control over the domain, hosting, and some code that's being used.\n\nNow, the author is considering \"fucking his shit over\" to get the money owed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, the issue is about enforceability of verbal agreements. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be valid, but proving terms (like the 5% stake) might be difficult without written evidence. The author might have a case for payment, but the lack of documentation could complicate things. \n\nEthically, the friend breached the agreement and ghosted, which is clearly wrong. However, the author's proposed response is to disrupt the company, which could involve illegal actions like shutting down systems or removing code. That's not justifiable, even if the friend was in the wrong. Retaliation through illegal means is still wrong. \n\nThe author might have legal remedies, like small claims court if they can prove the agreement existed. But taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the company could lead to legal trouble for the author. \n\nAlso, the author still has ownership of some assets (domain, hosting) and the code. They could legally negotiate to sell or transfer those assets for payment. But destroying or disabling the systems could be seen as sabotage, which is illegal regardless of the circumstances.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the friend is clearly in the wrong for breaking the agreement and not paying. However, the author's plan to disrupt the company is likely illegal and unethical, despite the friend's actions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such actions.\n"
