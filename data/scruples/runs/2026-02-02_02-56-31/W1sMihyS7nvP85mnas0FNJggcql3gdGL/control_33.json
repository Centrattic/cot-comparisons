He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would I Be Thinking About\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong after considering disrupting their former friend's successful company. \n\nFirst, the situation involves a verbal agreement where the friend promised $2000 and 5% equity for designing the website and POS system. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and went on to build a multi-million-dollar business. Now, the author is considering taking action to disrupt the company because they didn't get paid.\n\nSo, the main questions here are: Is the author legally entitled to the payment and equity? And even if they are, is it morally or ethically right to disrupt a company in retaliation?\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts are enforceable, but proving the terms\u2014like the 5% stake\u2014might be challenging without any written documentation. The author might have a case in terms of services rendered, but without a signed agreement, it's hard to say. The friend could dispute the terms or the amount owed. However, the author still holds the domain and hosting under their name, which might affect the company's operations if they were to remove access. \n\nEthically, the author's right to payment isn't in question if the friend indeed agreed to pay. But seeking revenge by disrupting the company's operations could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the friend wronged them, sabotaging a business could lead to legal consequences for the author, such as theft of property, breach of contract, or causing financial harm. Additionally, it might not be the best approach for resolving the dispute. The author could pursue legal action to claim what's owed instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nThe author mentions that the POS system and some code are still in use. If they remove access or tamper with the systems, they could be committing a crime. On the other hand, if they are the rightful owner of the domain and code, they might have legal grounds to reclaim them, but doing so in a way that causes harm could still be problematic. \n\nAnother angle is the friendship. The author felt betrayed and lost a friend, which adds emotional weight. But acting out of anger might not resolve the issue and could lead to further conflict. \n\nIn summary, while the author might have a legal claim for unpaid services, taking action to disrupt the company isn't advisable. They should consider legal avenues to recover what's owed. Therefore, the author is in the wrong if they proceed with sabotage, as it's not a lawful or constructive resolution.\n"
