  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for potentially disrupting their friend's multi-million-dollar company. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, there's a verbal agreement six years ago. The user was paid $2000 plus a 5% stake in the company for designing the website and POS system. The friend didn't pay the $2000 upfront to the designer, but the designer did get paid, while the user didn't. The friend then ghosted the user, cutting off communication except for occasional Facebook interactions. Now, the user has access to the domain and hosting, which are in their name, and their code is still in use.\n\nSo, legally, the verbal agreement might be tricky. Verbal contracts can be enforceable but proving them can be hard. The user hasn't received payment or equity, but they also haven't taken legal action. Now, considering that the friend has built a successful company using the user's work, the user is thinking about disrupting the company to get what's owed.\n\nEthically, the friend reneged on the agreement, which is unfair. However, taking revenge by sabotaging the company could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the user is in the right regarding the debt, retaliating with disruptive actions could harm innocent people, like employees or customers. The user might have legal recourse, such as suing for the unpaid amount and breach of contract, but taking matters into their own hands by disabling systems could lead to legal trouble for them as well.\n\nAlso, the user has access to assets (domain, hosting) that are legally in their name. If they set up the domain and hosting under their own accounts, they might have legal ownership, but using that to disrupt the company could still be problematic. It's a complex mix of legal and ethical issues. While the friend was wrong to not honor the agreement, the user's response could also be considered wrong if it causes harm beyond seeking their own compensation. There might be a more constructive way to resolve this, like legal action or mediation, without resorting to sabotage.\n"
