  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's successful company. The situation started with a verbal agreement for payment and a stake in the company for designing a website and POS system. The friend didn't follow through on payments, ghosted, and now the company is worth millions.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, contracts for services can be verbal, but proving the terms (like the 5% stake) might be tough without written evidence. The user might have a case for the $2000, but the equity part is harder unless there's proof. The domain and hosting being in the user's name could be a point in their favor regarding ownership of the code, but if the friend has been using the code without permission, that's a different issue.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement and ghosted, which is bad. But the user considering dismantling the friend's business now could be seen as revenge, which isn't morally justified. Even if the friend was wrong, taking actions that harm the company could be unethical and possibly illegal, like sabotage or intellectual property theft if the user doesn't actually own the code anymore.\n\nThe user mentions that the friend hired someone else to maintain the work, but some code is still theirs. If the user still holds the copyright, they might have legal rights to the code. However, using that to disrupt the company could lead to legal repercussions for both parties. The user could face charges for interfering with business operations or violating IP laws depending on the situation.\n\nEmotionally, the user is hurt and feels betrayed. But acting out of anger might not be the best approach. They might have legitimate grievances, but the method of seeking justice here is questionable. They could consider legal action to claim what's owed, but taking down the company is another level.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were wrong, the user's potential actions could also have legal and ethical consequences. So, even if the user isn't in the wrong for being upset, their plan to disrupt the company might be legally and ethically problematic.\n"
