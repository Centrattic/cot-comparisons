  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong if they disrupt their former friend's successful company. The key points here are the original agreement, the lack of formal contracts, and the passage of time.\n\nFirst, they had a verbal agreement six years ago. They designed a website and POS system for their friend's company, expecting $2000 and a 5% stake. But after delivering the work, the friend ghosted them. Now, the company has grown to be worth millions, and the friend hasn't paid or acknowledged them. The user still holds onto domain and hosting under their name and has access to the code, some of which is still in use.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user would be in the wrong if they disrupt the company. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. The user might not have a strong legal claim, especially after six years. Statutes of limitations vary by jurisdiction, but some claims might be time-barred.\n\nEthically, the user did the work and expected compensation. The friend breached the agreement and lost contact. The user's anger is justified, but taking retaliatory actions like disrupting the company could lead to legal repercussions. Even if they have access to the systems, intentionally causing harm could be considered sabotage or theft, which is illegal.\n\nAlso, the user mentions not caring about the money anymore but wanting the friend back. Now, with the friend's success, the user feels wronged. However, seeking revenge through destruction is unlikely to achieve the desired outcome and could result in criminal charges or civil liability.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were unethical, the user's retaliation would likely be illegal and ethically questionable. So, the user would be in the wrong to disrupt the company.\n"
