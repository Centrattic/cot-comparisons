He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for disrupting their friend's multi-million-dollar company. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author helped their friend start a company by designing the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement where the author was to be paid $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and ghosted them. Now, years later, the friend is successful and the author is considering messing up their company to get money and the stake.\n\nHmm, the main issue seems to be the enforcement of the verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be tricky. They might be legally binding, but proving them can be hard. The author did the work, but since the friend didn't follow through on payment, the author is upset. But does that justify disrupting the company? \n\nAlso, the author mentions they still have access to the domain and webhost, and their code is still in use. Maybe there's a legal claim here. If the author owns the code, then the friend might be using it without permission. But the author is thinking of \"fucking his shit over,\" which sounds like sabotage. That's illegal regardless of the situation. Even if there's a dispute, intentional damage to someone's property is a crime. \n\nAdditionally, the author's actions could be considered revenge, which might not be justified. Even if the friend breached the agreement, the proper way would be to seek legal recourse, not to take matters into one's own hands. The author might have a valid claim, but sabotaging the company is not the right approach. \n\nSo, even though the friend might be at fault for not paying, the author's plan to disrupt the company is likely illegal and unethical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such actions.\n"
