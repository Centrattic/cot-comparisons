He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible For...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% equity. The author worked on it, but then the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author is considering messing up the friend's work because they feel wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, contracts for services under a certain amount (like $2000) might not require a written agreement, but proving the terms, especially equity stakes, could be hard. The author might not have a legal claim because there's no written contract. So legally, the author might be in a tough spot.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement by not paying and cutting off contact. The author did the work and was left out of the friend's life. The friend is now successful without compensating the author. The author feels wronged, but revenge by disrupting the company could be seen as unethical. Even if the friend was in the wrong, retaliating by harming the company could be considered over the line. The author might have options like sending a demand letter or seeking legal advice, but taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" seems wrong.\n\nAlso, the author still has control over the domain and code. They could legally take steps to reclaim or demand payment, but actively sabotaging the company would be illegal and unethical. So while the friend might be in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, the author's potential retaliation could make them in the wrong as well. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company, even if the friend was unethical. The proper course of action would be to pursue legal remedies rather than personal vengeance.\n"
