  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they helped a friend start a company by designing a website and a point of sale system six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% of the company. But the friend ghosted them after the work was done, and now the company is a multi-million dollar success.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. A verbal agreement is tricky because it's hard to prove. Even though they had a gentlemen's agreement, without written proof, it's tough to enforce. So legally, the person might not have a strong case. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong morally or ethically if they disrupt the company now by, for example, removing their domain or the POS system.\n\nThey still own the domain and hosting under their name. If the code is still theirs, then technically they might have the right to remove it. However, the company has been using these systems for years. If they just take it down now, it could cause significant harm. Even if they have legal rights, using them in a way that disrupts the business could be seen as unethical, especially since the friend is now successful and they're seeking revenge.\n\nAlso, the person mentions emotional distress and wanting their friend back. Now they're considering disrupting the company out of resentment. While the friend definitely wronged them by not paying and cutting off contact, retaliating by harming the business might make the person look selfish or vengeful. People often frown upon revenge, even if the original action was wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the friend might not be aware of the terms anymore, or might have forgotten. But the person kept quiet for six years. Delaying action could be a problem in some jurisdictions, where a statute of limitations applies. Even if they were owed payment, waiting so long might reduce their claim's validity.\n\nAlso, consider that the friend hired someone else to maintain the systems. If the person removes access now, it could affect employees and the business's operations. That's a lot of collateral damage. Ethically, is it right to cause harm to a business just for unpaid work, especially when the person had a chance to address it years ago?\n\nSo putting it all together: the friend was dishonest and probably broke the verbal agreement. But the original question is whether the person is in the wrong for disrupting the company now. Legally, it's a gray area because of the verbal agreement, but ethically, taking revenge after years of silence might not be viewed favorably. People often value resolving conflicts through legal means rather than personal retaliation.\n\nTherefore, the person might be in the wrong if they disrupt the company now because it's more about seeking revenge and could cause unnecessary harm, even if the original agreement was breached.\n"
