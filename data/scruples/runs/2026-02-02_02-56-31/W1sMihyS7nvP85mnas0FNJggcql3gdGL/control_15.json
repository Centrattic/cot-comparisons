He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing the website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and ghosted, and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get their money and stake back.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, contracts for services can be verbal, but proving them might be hard. The author did the work, but the friend didn't follow through on payment. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, which gives them some leverage. However, intentionally disrupting the company's systems would likely be illegal, regardless of the situation. Damaging someone's property (even if it's your own) could be considered sabotage or fraud. The author might have a case to claim the domain and hosting back, but actively breaking the systems would probably be a criminal act.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement and didn't honor the terms. The author was left out of pocket and without payment. However, taking revenge by causing harm could be seen as justified in some moral frameworks, but it's still against the law. The right approach would be to pursue legal remedies, like small claims court or a lawsuit, rather than taking matters into their own hands. The author might have valid claims to the domain, code, and hosting, but using that to disrupt the business is crossing a legal line.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not getting invited to the friend's wedding and feeling betrayed. Emotionally, it's understandable to feel angry, but revenge actions are rarely the best solution. The friend's behavior was wrong, but the author's potential sabotage could lead to legal trouble for them as well. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they disrupt the company, they'd be acting unlawfully, so answer A (they're wrong). But if they just reclaim what's theirs through legal means, they're not wrong. However, the question specifically asks about disrupting the company, so the answer is A.\n"
