  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they helped a friend start a company by designing a website and point of sale system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. They worked on it for two weeks and then six more weeks of tweaks. The friend ghosted them after that, didn't pay, and now the company is multi-million dollar. The person is considering disrupting the friend's business because they feel wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court depending on the jurisdiction. But the person still has control over the domain, webhost, and some of the code. They might have legal rights to the intellectual property they created. If they remove or alter those, could that be legal? If they own the IP, maybe they have the right to do that. But it's a bit of a gray area because when you create something for someone else, even without a contract, there might be assumptions of ownership. However, since there's no written contract, it's hard to say. \n\nEthically, the person was promised payment and a stake. The friend didn't follow through, which is clearly wrong. But taking revenge by disrupting the business could be seen as unethical, even if the friend was in the wrong. The question is whether the person's actions would be justified. On one hand, they're trying to get what was owed to them. On the other hand, causing harm to the business might be considered over the top, especially now that years have passed. \n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the person lost a friend and felt betrayed. The friend's actions were hurtful, but retaliating in a way that could shut down the business might be seen as extreme. There's also the question of whether there's a better way to handle this, like legal action. However, given the time that's passed, statutes of limitations might be an issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, legally, the person might have a case regarding the IP and the unpaid work, but ethically, taking down the business could be seen as revenge rather than a legitimate claim. So, depending on the perspective, the answer might vary. If the person uses their legal rights to claim what's owed, that's one thing. But if they're actively disrupting the business beyond what's legally justified, that's another. \n\nSo, the answer could be either A or B. If the person is acting within their legal rights, then B. If they're crossing ethical lines by causing unnecessary disruption, then A. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, considering both legal and ethical angles, the answer might be A because even if there's a claim, the method of seeking justice is harmful and possibly illegal. But I'm not sure. Need to think again.\n\nThe person mentions that the code is still being used, and they have access. If they remove the domain or the POS system, the company would suffer. Legally, they might have the right to do that if they own the IP. But ethically, that's causing harm for revenge, which is morally wrong. So the answer might be A because the action is ethically wrong even if there's a legal basis. Alternatively, maybe B because the friend was in the wrong and the person is trying to get justice. It's tricky.\n\nAnother angle: the original agreement was verbal, and the person didn't enforce a written contract. By not doing so, they might have contributed to the problem. However, the friend was a \"friend,\" so maybe the expectation wasn't as strict. But in business, verbal agreements are risky. So in a way, the person might share some responsibility for not securing the terms in writing. But that doesn't mean the friend is right. \n\nIn conclusion, the person might not be in the wrong ethically if they're asserting their rights, but legally it's complicated. However, the disruptive action could be seen as revenge, making it ethically questionable. So the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) or B (they aren't). I'm leaning towards A because causing harm to disrupt a business, even if someone wronged you, is generally considered unethical and possibly illegal beyond the scope of rightful claims.\n"
