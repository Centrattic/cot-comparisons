  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their former friend's successful company. The situation started with a verbal agreement where they were to be paid $2000 and a 5% stake for designing a website and POS system. The friend didn't pay and ghosted them, leading to years of silence. Now, the user is thinking about taking action to \"fuck his shit over\" because they didn't get paid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, contracts for services can be verbal, but proving the terms might be difficult. The user has a claim based on a verbal agreement, but without written proof, it's hard to enforce. However, they still have control over the domain and hosting, and some of their code is in use. Legally, if they didn't transfer the intellectual property rights, they might have a case for ownership of the code. Disrupting the company by, say, taking down the website or removing access could be considered sabotage or theft, which is illegal regardless of the circumstances. Even if there's a dispute over payment, destroying someone else's business assets is not a legal remedy.\n\nEthically, the situation is more nuanced. The friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is unfair. The user invested time and effort and wasn't compensated. But seeking revenge by harming the company isn't ethical. It's understandable to feel wronged, but the appropriate response would be to pursue legal action, send a demand letter, or take the matter to court. Taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the business would make them an antagonist in the ethical sense, even if they feel wronged.\n\nAlso, consider the emotional aspect. The user mentions they wanted their friend back and felt ignored. Now, after years of silence, they're angry. But revenge rarely fixes the emotional hurt and could lead to further complications. The friend is now a millionaire, and the user's actions could result in legal consequences, like being sued for damages.\n\nIn summary, while the user has a legitimate grievance regarding the unpaid agreement, taking retaliatory actions against the company is both legally problematic and ethically wrong. The correct course would be to seek legal recourse rather than sabotage.\n"
