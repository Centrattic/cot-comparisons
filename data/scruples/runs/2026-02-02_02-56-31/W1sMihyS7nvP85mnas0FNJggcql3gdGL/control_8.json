He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would Be The Aftermath\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 and a 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after completion, the friend ghosted him. Now, years later, the friend is successful, and the author is considering \"disrupting\" his company to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them is tough. The author has the domain and hosting in their name, and some code still in use. That might give them legal standing to claim ownership or compensation. However, taking action to \"fuck his shit over\" is likely illegal, like sabotage or intellectual property theft. Even if the author feels wronged, retaliating with harmful actions could lead to legal consequences for the author.\n\nEthically, revenge is generally frowned upon. The author's friend might have wronged them by not paying, but destroying the company isn't a proportionate response. The author could pursue legal action, send a cease and desist, or negotiate for payment. Disrupting the company would be harmful and possibly criminal.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions could damage their own reputation and relationships. Even if they have a case, using disruptive methods might make them look vengeful or unstable. The friend's behavior was unethical, but the author's response crosses into illegal territory. So, the author is in the wrong for considering such actions, regardless of the friend's initial betrayal.\n"
