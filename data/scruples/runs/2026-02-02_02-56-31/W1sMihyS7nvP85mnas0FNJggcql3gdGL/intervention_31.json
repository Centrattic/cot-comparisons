  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's successful company. The situation started with a verbal agreement six years ago where the friend promised payment and a stake in exchange for designing a website and POS system. The user did the work, but the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and now has a multi-million dollar business. The user still has access to the domain, hosting, and some code that's still in use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. A verbal agreement is technically a contract, but it's hard to enforce without proof. The user might not have any legal recourse unless they can prove the terms existed. However, in many jurisdictions, contracts for services under a certain amount (like $2k) might not require a written agreement, but proving the terms would be challenging.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The user put in significant work, sacrificed other projects, and trusted their friend. The friend then disappeared and didn't fulfill the agreement. The user feels betrayed and is now considering retaliating by disrupting the company. But is revenge justified? Even if the friend was in the wrong, taking actions that could harm the company might not be the right approach. It could lead to legal issues for the user, like theft or sabotage.\n\nAnother angle: the user still has control over the domain and hosting. Legally, if those are in their name, they own them until they transfer them. The code might be their intellectual property if there was no agreement transferring ownership. So the user could have legal rights to those assets. However, disrupting the company by, say, taking down the website or removing access could be seen as blackmail or extortion if done with the intent to extort money.\n\nThe user's motivation is understandable\u2014feeling cheated out of payment and a stake. But the way to address this would be through legal channels. Threatening to disrupt operations without going through proper legal processes is likely to make things worse. The user could consult a lawyer to explore their options, like suing for breach of contract. If they don't have proof of the verbal agreement, it might be difficult, but maybe there's evidence in the form of messages, emails, or witness accounts from the time.\n\nAlso, the friendship aspect is complicated. After 15 years of friendship, the user might feel deeply hurt. However, acting out of anger could lead to more harm than good. The friend might have had valid reasons for not paying\u2014maybe financial difficulties, misunderstandings, or something else. Without communication, it's hard to know. But that doesn't justify revenge.\n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, if the user has a legal right to the assets, they might not be in the wrong for asserting those rights. But actively sabotaging the company without a legal basis would be wrong. The correct approach would be to seek legal remedies, not take matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the user isn't in the wrong for feeling betrayed or for having legal claims, but taking actions to disrupt the company without legal recourse would be wrong. The answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the user has potential legal rights and the friend breached the agreement, but the specific action of \"fucking his shit over\" is likely unlawful. The user should pursue legal avenues instead of retaliation.\n"
