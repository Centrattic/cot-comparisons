  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong if they disrupt their friend's company. The situation started six years ago when the friend asked them to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% equity. The user worked on it, but after completion, the friend ghosted them. Now the company is successful, and the user is considering taking action to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them can be difficult. Since there's no written contract, it's hard to enforce the payment or equity terms. The user might not have a strong legal claim here, especially if they haven't taken steps to document the agreement since.\n\nEmotionally, the user feels wronged. They invested time and work, expecting compensation, but were ignored. However, taking retaliatory actions like disrupting the company could lead to legal issues for the user. Even if the friend is in the wrong, the user could be seen as committing a crime if they sabotage the company.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The user's actions could be viewed as self-help, but they might also be considered vindictive. The friend's actions were unethical by not fulfilling the agreement, but the user's response could escalate the conflict negatively.\n\nPractically, the user has control over the domain and hosting. They could potentially shut down the website or remove their code, but that might harm their own position legally. If they do this, the friend could argue breach of contract or even theft of intellectual property if the user didn't transfer rights properly.\n\nThe user mentions they haven't been paid and the friend is now successful. The user might have a claim for unpaid work, but without a contract, it's hard to collect. They might need to consult a lawyer to explore options like a breach of contract claim, but that's different from taking direct action.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were wrong, the user's plan to disrupt the company could put them in legal trouble. The right approach would be to seek legal recourse rather than taking matters into their own hands. So, the answer is that the user is in the wrong if they proceed with disruptive actions.\n"
