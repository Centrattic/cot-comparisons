He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the verbal agreement, the lack of formal contract, and the author's potential actions. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they can be hard to enforce without evidence. The problem here is that there's no written contract. The author might have a claim if they can prove the agreement existed, but proving that could be difficult. However, taking matters into one's own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" sounds like an act of revenge rather than a legal remedy. \n\nEven if the author is owed money, disrupting a company through unethical or illegal means is not the right approach. The proper course would be to seek legal action, like small claims court, if possible. But if the author can't prove the agreement, they might not have a case. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions they still own the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. That could strengthen their position if they take legal steps. However, threatening or actually sabotaging the company could lead to legal consequences for the author, like defamation or hacking charges.\n\nSo, while the friend's actions (not paying) were wrong, the author's planned retaliation is not justified. The right approach is to pursue legal remedies, not take destructive actions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such actions.\n"
