He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the friend started a company six years ago. He asked the author to design his website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement: $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, put other projects aside, took two weeks to get it functional and another six weeks for tweaks. The friend also hired a designer who was paid $2000 upfront but didn't get a stake. \n\nAfter finishing the work, the author was ghosted. The friend didn't respond to messages, and their friendship faded. Now, the company is successful, with multiple stores and the friend is a millionaire. The author hasn't been paid, and now they're considering disrupting the friend's business by taking legal action or something else.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's think about the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many jurisdictions isn't invalid but can be hard to prove. The author might have a case for breach of contract if they can prove the agreement existed. However, since it's verbal and there's no written evidence, it's tricky. Also, the author still has control over the domain and hosting, and some of their code is still in use. That might mean they have some legal rights over the intellectual property.\n\nBut ethically, the friend didn't pay or acknowledge the agreement. The author worked hard, sacrificed other projects, and was left out of the loop. The friend is now successful without compensating them. However, the author is considering disrupting the business, which could be seen as revenge rather than seeking payment. \n\nLegally, the author might have grounds for a claim, but ethically, seeking revenge by messing up the business could be problematic. The author could pursue legal action through small claims court if possible, but threatening to disrupt the business might be seen as malicious. \n\nAlso, the author's actions of maintaining control over the domain and hosting could be seen as holding leverage, which might not be ethical if they're using it for revenge. The friend's actions were unethical by not honoring the agreement, but the author's response might cross a line into unethical behavior as well.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong legally if they can prove the agreement, but ethically, their plan to \"fuck his shit over\" could be seen as wrong because it's retaliatory and harmful beyond seeking compensation. The appropriate action would be to pursue legal channels for payment, not sabotage.\n"
