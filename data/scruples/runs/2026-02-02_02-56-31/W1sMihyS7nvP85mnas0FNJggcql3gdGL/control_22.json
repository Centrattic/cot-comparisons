He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for potentially disrupting their friend's successful company. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a verbal agreement where the author was supposed to be paid $2000 plus a 5% stake in the company. The friend asked the author to design the website and POS system. The author worked on it for eight weeks, put other projects aside, and then wasn't paid. The friend also ghosted them, cutting off communication except for occasional social media interactions. Now, the company is multi-million dollar, and the author is considering disrupting it to get what they believe they're owed.\n\nSo the main points here are: verbal contract, no payment, access to domain and code still in the author's name, and the friend's success using the author's work.\n\nLegally, verbal contracts can be enforceable, but they might be hard to prove without evidence. The author did the work, but the friend didn't pay. However, the author is now thinking of taking drastic actions, like \"fucking his shit over,\" which sounds illegal (like sabotaging the company's systems). Even if the author has legal rights to the domain and code, taking revenge through sabotage would likely be illegal, regardless of the original dispute.\n\nMorally, the friend broke the agreement and the trust. The author might feel wronged, but retaliating with harmful actions isn't the right approach. The friend's actions were unethical, but the author's potential actions (sabotage) are also unethical and illegal. The author could pursue legal avenues, like suing for the unpaid amount and breach of contract, but taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the company is not justified.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and code, which might mean they could legally claim compensation or demand payment. However, destroying or disrupting the company's operations would cross a line. The friend's failure to honor the agreement doesn't give the author the right to commit crimes in response.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral aspects, the author is in the wrong if they proceed to disrupt the company. Even though the friend wronged them, the author's actions would be illegal and unethical. The correct approach would be to seek legal remedies, not take revenge.\n"
