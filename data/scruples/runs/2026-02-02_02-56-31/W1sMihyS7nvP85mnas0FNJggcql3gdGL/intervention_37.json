  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this scenario. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their former friend's company. The situation starts with a verbal agreement six years ago where the user was paid $2000 plus a 5% stake in the company. They did the work, but the friend ghosted them, leading to years of no contact. Now, the company is worth millions, and the user wants to take action by messing up the website and POS system since they still hold the domain, hosting, and some code.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them can be tough. The user might have a case for breach of contract, but without written evidence, it's challenging. However, the user still maintains control over the domain and hosting, which they might not have a right to if the agreement implied transferring ownership once paid. If the friend never paid, the user might have rightful ownership of those assets until payment is received.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement by ghosting and not paying. The user's anger is understandable given the betrayal. However, taking revenge by disrupting the company could be seen as unethical, even if the friend was wrong. The user could pursue legal action instead, which is a more appropriate route than sabotage. \n\nAlso, the user's actions could lead to legal consequences for the user, like charges of sabotage or theft. Even if they have a valid claim, intentionally damaging property is still a crime. The user should consider legal options first, such as sending a demand letter or small claims court. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions were clearly wrong. They benefited from the user's work without compensation and cut off contact. The user's frustration is justified, but the method of addressing it is problematic. The answer probably leans towards the user not being in the wrong about the initial agreement but being in the wrong about the chosen method of resolution. However, the question is whether the user is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company. Since the user's action is illegal regardless of the situation, the answer would be that they are in the wrong, but the reasons are more about legal and ethical considerations.\n"
