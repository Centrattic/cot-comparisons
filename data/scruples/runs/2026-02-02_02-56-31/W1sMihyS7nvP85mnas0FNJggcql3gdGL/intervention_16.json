  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their former friend's successful company. The situation involves a verbal agreement from six years ago where the user was supposed to get $2000 and 5% of the company in exchange for designing a website and POS system. They worked on it, but then the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and the company became a multi-million dollar success.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. A verbal agreement can be legally binding, but it's often hard to enforce. Since there's no written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. The user might not have a strong legal claim here. But then, the user still has ownership of the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. Maybe there's something there in terms of intellectual property rights. If they didn't transfer the rights to the code, they could have a case for copyright infringement if the friend is using their work without permission.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is a breach of trust. The user was promised payment and a stake, which they didn't receive. The friend also cut off all communication, which is hurtful. But does that justify disrupting the friend's company? Even if the user has a right to be upset, taking action to disrupt the company could lead to legal issues for them. If the user takes down the website or disables the POS system, the friend could sue for damages, even if there was a breach of the original agreement.\n\nAnother angle: the user has access to the domain and hosting. Maybe they can use that as leverage to negotiate payment. But threatening to take down services could be seen as extortion. Alternatively, they might need to pursue legal action to claim what's owed, but again, without a written contract, it's tricky.\n\nAlso, consider the long-term consequences. Even if the user has a valid grievance, taking action might lead to a legal battle that's costly and time-consuming. The friend is now retired and successful, so he might have resources to defend against any claims.\n\nIn terms of morality, the user has been wronged. But their response could be seen as revenge rather than justice. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the friend is at fault, the user's actions could be harmful and potentially illegal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is likely in the wrong because their proposed action (disrupting the company) is not a legal or ethical solution to their grievance. They should explore legal avenues if possible, but direct sabotage would be unethical and possibly illegal.\n"
