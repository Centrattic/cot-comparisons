He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author did the work but wasn't paid, and now the friend is successful while the author is considering disrupting the company.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal and ethical aspects here. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, contracts for services can be verbal, but enforcing them might be difficult without proof. The author mentions a \"gentleman's agreement\" which isn't legally binding in itself. However, there's the question of whether there's any evidence of this agreement. The user says it was a verbal contract only they knew about. Without witnesses or written documentation, proving the agreement might be hard in court.\n\nThen, the author did the work, but the friend ghosted them. The author hasn't received payment or the stake. Now, the friend is successful and the author is considering taking action. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they disrupt the company.\n\nLegally, the author might have a case for breach of contract if they can prove the agreement existed. However, without written proof, this could be challenging. But since the author still owns the domain and hosting, and the code isn't released, there's a possible intellectual property angle. If the author hasn't transferred the rights, the company might be using the code without proper licensing. That could mean the friend is infringing on the author's IP rights.\n\nEthically, the friend breaking a verbal agreement and ghosting is clearly wrong. The author might feel justified in taking action, but the method matters. Disrupting the company could be seen as revenge, which might not be morally acceptable, even if the friend was unethical. However, the author could argue that they're seeking compensation for their work.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. If they do disrupt the company, they could face legal repercussions. Even if they have a claim, taking matters into their own hands by sabotaging the business could be illegal. The appropriate course would be to pursue legal action, not personal retaliation.\n\nSo, legally, the author might have a case but needs to take it to court. Ethically, the friend is wrong, but the author's retaliation could be seen as wrong because it's not through proper channels. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for considering sabotage instead of legal recourse. However, there's an argument that the author isn't in the wrong because the friend broke the agreement. But the act of disrupting the company could be illegal regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe answer likely leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the potential illegal actions, but there's nuance. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and if they disrupt the company, they could be committing a crime, regardless of the friendship's history. So, Answer A.\n"
