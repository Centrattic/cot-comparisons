He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nSo, the author's friend started a company six years ago and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, putting other projects aside, and the friend hired a designer who was paid $2000 upfront but didn't get a stake. After the work was done, the friend ghosted the author, leading to a loss of friendship. Now, the company is successful with multiple stores, and the author hasn't been paid. The friend has access to the domain and hosting under the author's name, and some of the author's code is still in use. The author is considering disrupting the friend's business to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, contracts for services over a certain amount need to be in writing to be enforceable. The 5% stake and $2000 payment are part of a verbal agreement. Without written proof, it might be hard to enforce legally. The author might not have a strong legal claim here.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is unfair. But the author is considering taking drastic actions like disrupting the business. Even if the friend is in the wrong, retaliating by sabotaging the business could be seen as equally wrong. Both parties might have moral faults, but the author's actions could cross a line.\n\nAdditionally, the author still has control over the domain and hosting. Legally, they might have the right to access those since they're in their name. But intentionally causing harm could lead to legal issues, even if the original agreement was breached. The author should consider legal avenues first, like sending a demand letter or pursuing small claims court if possible.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels wronged, which is understandable. But using sabotage as a response might not be the right approach. It could lead to further conflict and potential legal consequences. The friend's actions were unethical, but the author's retaliation could be seen as equally harmful, making them both at fault in terms of how they handle the situation.\n\nIn summary, while the friend clearly broke the verbal agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the business could be illegal and ethically questionable. The author should seek legal recourse rather than taking matters into their own hands. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for considering sabotage despite the friend's initial wrongdoing.\n"
