He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong if they disrupt their ex-friend's company. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, there's a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake in the company. The author did the backend work, took two weeks to build and six weeks for tweaks. The friend ghosted after that, didn't pay, and now has a multi-million-dollar business. The author still has the domain and hosting under their name, and their code is still in use. The friend hired someone else for maintenance, and the designer was paid but didn't get a stake.\n\nSo the author is considering messing up the company's systems. The question is whether they're in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, verbal agreements can be tricky, but if there's evidence, maybe the author has a case. However, the author is thinking of taking revenge by disrupting the company, which is probably illegal. Even if they have a valid grievance, taking matters into your own hands by damaging someone's business is generally not acceptable. \n\nEthically, while the friend broke the agreement, the author's response could be seen as taking justice into their own hands. It's possible the author has rights to the code, but using that to harm the company might not be justified. Legally, the friend might owe money and the stake, so the author should probably pursue legal action instead of sabotage. \n\nSo the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because disrupting someone's company is not the right way to handle a dispute. They should seek legal remedies instead of personal revenge.\n"
