  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their former friend's successful company. The situation started with a verbal agreement six years ago where they were supposed to get $2000 and 5% stake for building a website and POS system. But the friend ghosted them after the work was done and now the company is worth millions.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. They might be enforceable, but proving the terms could be tough without any written evidence. The user mentions a \"gentlemen's agreement,\" which is essentially a verbal contract. But in many jurisdictions, contracts for services over a certain amount need to be in writing to be valid. Since it's six years later, there might also be issues with the statute of limitations on claims, depending on the location.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreed payment and stake, which is a breach of trust. The user invested time and effort, and the friend disappeared, which is unfair. However, taking revenge by disrupting the company could lead to legal trouble. Even if the user still holds some intellectual property rights (like the domain and code), using that to sabotage the business might be illegal, regardless of the initial wrongdoing.\n\nThe user has access to the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. If they were never formally transferred those rights, they might have a legal claim to compensation or ownership. But deliberately damaging the company's operations could be considered malicious, leading to potential legal consequences like being sued for damages or even criminal charges if it's considered sabotage.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is there\u2014the user feels betrayed and wants retribution. But acting on that could escalate the situation. It's important to consider whether pursuing legal action through proper channels (like small claims court or a lawyer) would be a better approach than taking matters into one's own hands.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were wrong, the user's plan to disrupt the company could make them legally liable. The answer likely leans towards the user being in the wrong if they proceed with sabotage, as the appropriate course would be to seek legal remedies rather than take revenge.\n"
