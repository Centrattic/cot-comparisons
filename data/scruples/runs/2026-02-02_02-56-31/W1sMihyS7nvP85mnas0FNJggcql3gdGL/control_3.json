He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and had a verbal agreement with the author to design the website and POS system. The author says they agreed to $2000 plus 5% equity, but the friend never paid and ghosted them. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court, especially if there's no written proof. But the author had the domain and hosting in their name, and owns a lot of the code. That could be a legal basis to claim ownership of the work. So maybe they have rights to the code.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement. He benefited from the author's work without paying. But the author is thinking of retaliating by disrupting the company. Even if they have a claim, taking actions like removing their code or taking down websites could be considered sabotage, which is unethical and possibly illegal. Even if the author feels wronged, destroying someone else's property or business is not justified, regardless of the situation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they've stewed in emotions and gave up until recently. Now they want revenge. But revenge is not a valid legal or ethical response. They might need to pursue legal action instead, like suing for the owed money and equity. However, since it's a verbal agreement, proving it could be hard. They might need to consult a lawyer.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. Legally, they might have some standing regarding the code ownership, but the equity part is hard to enforce without a contract. Ethically, their plan to disrupt the company is wrong because it's an act of revenge and could cause more harm than good. They should seek legal remedies instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n"
