He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would Brian Do\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their former friend's successful company. The situation involves a verbal agreement for payment and equity in exchange for designing a website and POS system, which was never fulfilled. The friend later became successful, and the author is now contemplating taking action to sabotage the company due to unpaid compensation and lost friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many jurisdictions can still be legally binding, but proving it might be difficult. The author has some control over the domain and hosting, and parts of the code are still in use. However, the friend has been using the services for years, and the author hasn't taken any legal action yet. There's also the question of whether the author has the right to access or control the systems now that the company has grown.\n\nEthically, the friend's behavior of ghosting and not providing any compensation is clearly wrong. The author's desire for payment and recognition is understandable, but the proposed action of \"fucking his shit over\" is extreme. Sabotaging someone's business, even if they've wronged you, is generally considered unethical and illegal. It could lead to legal consequences for both parties.\n\nThe author's emotional response after years of resentment might justify their feelings, but acting on them through destructive means isn't the right approach. There are other avenues to pursue, like legal action or seeking mediation. The fact that the author hasn't taken these steps yet suggests they might be looking for validation for a more aggressive response, which isn't advisable.\n\nAdditionally, the author still has access to certain assets, which could be used to negotiate or seek payment. Removing access might be a leverage point, but again, it's a form of coercion and could lead to legal trouble. The key point is whether the author's actions are proportionate and justifiable. Since the friend's actions were unethical, the author's retaliation crosses into unethical and potentially illegal territory.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend is clearly in the wrong, the author's proposed action is not justified. The appropriate response would be to seek legal recourse rather than sabotage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such drastic measures.\n"
