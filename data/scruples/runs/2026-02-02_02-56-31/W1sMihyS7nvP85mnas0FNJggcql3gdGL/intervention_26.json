  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether they would be in the wrong if they disrupted their friend's company. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the friend started a company six years ago and asked the user to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement: $2000 plus 5% stake. The user worked on it, took time off other projects, and finished. But then the friend ghosted them, no payment, no communication. The friend is now successful, owns houses, has multiple stores. The user mentions that the domain and hosting are in their name, and their code is still in use. They're considering taking action to disrupt the company because of the unpaid $2000 and potential millions in options.\n\nSo, the user is wondering if they'd be in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult, but in some jurisdictions, verbal agreements are enforceable. However, the user might not have a strong legal case without evidence. Also, the domain and hosting being in their name might mean they technically own those assets, but if they were supposed to transfer them as part of the agreement, that's another issue.\n\nEthically, the user is considering damaging the company to get what they believe is owed. Even if they have a claim, taking revenge by disrupting the company could be seen as unethical. It could also lead to legal consequences if they misuse their access. The friend might have had reasons for not paying, maybe financial difficulties, but that's not clear. The user's actions could escalate the conflict and harm their reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions were definitely wrong\u2014ghosting, not paying, using the work without compensation. But the user's response of disrupting the company might be considered over the top. There are other avenues, like legal action or mediation, which might be more appropriate.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the user's actions could be seen as wrong because they're taking illegal or unethical steps for revenge, even if the original agreement was breached. The answer is likely A (they're in the wrong), but I need to make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, if the user actually owns the domain and code, maybe they have a right to it. But disrupting the company would still be harmful and possibly illegal. So the answer is A.\n"
