He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it for eight weeks, then was ghosted. Now, the friend is successful and the author is considering disrupting his business to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might be tricky. In many places, contracts for services can be verbal, but proving the terms might be hard without written evidence. The author might not have a solid legal claim if they can't prove the 5% stake agreement existed. Also, the author still has control over the domain and hosting, which they mention. If they remove access, that could be considered sabotage, which is illegal regardless of the circumstances.\n\nEthically, the author feels wronged. They put in a lot of work and were promised payment and equity, which the friend didn't deliver. But retaliating by disrupting the business could be seen as harmful and potentially illegal. Even if the author believes they're owed money, using sabotage isn't a legal or ethical way to seek justice. They should probably go through legal channels instead.\n\nAlso, the friend's actions\u2014ghosting and not communicating\u2014were definitely wrong. But the author's response might cross a line. While the friend is at fault for breaking the agreement, the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" could lead to criminal charges or civil liability if they interfere with the business operations. It's not about who is more right, but about the legality and ethics of the author's actions.\n\nSo, even though the author might have a valid grievance, their plan to disrupt the business is not justified. They should seek legal recourse instead of taking matters into their own hands. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to sabotage their friend's company.\n"
