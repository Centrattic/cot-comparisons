  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's company. The situation is complex with a verbal agreement, no payment, and the friend's success now.\n\nFirst, the original agreement: a verbal contract for $2000 and 5% stake. But there's no written proof. The user did the backend work, which is still in use. The friend didn't pay and now is successful. The user hasn't been paid and is thinking of taking action to disrupt the company.\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be enforceable, but it's hard to prove without evidence. The user might have a case for payment, but without a contract, it's tricky. However, ethically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is unfair. But the user's plan to disrupt the company could cause harm beyond just seeking payment. It might be illegal if they take actions like deleting data or causing damage. Also, destroying someone's business could have legal consequences, like defamation or sabotage charges.\n\nEmotionally, the user feels wronged, but retaliation might not be the best approach. They could try legal means, like sending a demand letter or pursuing small claims court, but without a contract, it's uncertain. Alternatively, maybe they should just let it go. However, the fact that the code is still under their name gives them some leverage. They might be able to negotiate a payment now, but threatening to disrupt the company is crossing a line. It's possible they're not in the wrong for seeking payment, but the method they're considering (disrupting the company) is likely wrong and unethical. So the answer would be A (they are in the wrong for planning to disrupt) but maybe not for the initial agreement. Wait, the question is whether they're in the wrong for disrupting. So if the answer is about the action, then even if the friend is at fault, the disruption is wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
