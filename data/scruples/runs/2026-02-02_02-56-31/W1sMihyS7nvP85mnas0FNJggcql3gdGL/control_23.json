He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author did some work for a friend's company six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake. The friend didn't pay, ghosted them, and now the company is super successful. The author is considering messing up the friend's systems because they didn't get paid.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, they are legally binding, but proving them can be hard. The author might have a case for breach of contract if they can prove the agreement existed. But since it's verbal and there's no evidence, it's tough. Also, the author still has control over the domain and hosting. If they built the website and POS system, they might hold the intellectual property rights unless they transferred them. So maybe they have a right to the code, but using that to disrupt the company could be illegal.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The friend didn't pay and cut off contact, which is bad. The author is upset and wants retribution. But taking actions like deleting data or disrupting systems could be considered sabotage, which is a crime. Even if the author feels wronged, retaliating in this way is likely illegal and unethical. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they have access and could \"f**k his shit over.\" That sounds like a threat to destroy or damage property, which is definitely not okay. Even if they have a legal claim, intentional destruction of assets is criminal. They could face legal consequences for that.\n\nThe friend's side: he might argue that the verbal agreement isn't valid or that the author didn't deliver as promised. But the author did the work, and the friend used their work without paying. However, the friend might not even be aware of the author's access anymore. The author's actions could cause harm to the company and its employees, which adds another layer of ethical issues.\n\nIn summary, while the friend was wrong not to pay, the author's plan to disrupt the company is illegal and unethical. They should pursue legal avenues like small claims court to recover the debt instead of taking matters into their own hands. So the answer is A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
