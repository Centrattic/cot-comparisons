He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after finishing, the friend ghosted him. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the friend's business to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, they are legally binding, but proving the terms might be hard. The author has no written contract, which is a problem. The friend might argue that the verbal agreement never existed or was different. The author's actions, like withholding code or disrupting the system, could be seen as illegal if they cause damage or interfere with the business operations. Trespassing into digital systems without permission could lead to charges like computer fraud or sabotage.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Even if legally ambiguous, the author's threat of retaliation might be seen as unethical. The friend might have had reasons for not paying, maybe financial issues or a change in plans. The author's response of \"fucking his shit over\" is extreme. Taking down the website or POS system would harm customers and employees, which is morally questionable.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and hosting because they were set up under their name. Legally, the friend might need to transfer those properly. If the author removes access, it's a breach of property rights, but the friend might have already breached the original agreement. However, using that as leverage through sabotage is not a legal remedy. The proper course would be to pursue legal action, like small claims court, but threatening to destroy the business is not a valid legal action.\n\nThe emotional aspect is there too. The author feels wronged and wants closure. But acting out of anger can lead to worse consequences. The friend might have valid reasons for not following through, but that doesn't justify the author's plan. There's also the question of whether the author's actions would be considered a crime, which could lead to legal trouble for them.\n\nIn summary, while the friend might be at fault for not honoring the verbal agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the business is likely illegal and unethical. The correct approach would be to seek legal recourse rather than taking matters into their own hands. So, the author is in the wrong for planning to sabotage the business.\n"
