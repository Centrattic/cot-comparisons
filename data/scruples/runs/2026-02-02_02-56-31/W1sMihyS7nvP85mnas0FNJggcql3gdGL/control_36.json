He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. The situation involves a verbal agreement where the friend promised payment and a stake for designing his website and POS system. But now, years later, the friend hasn't paid and the author is thinking of taking action.\n\nFirst, the verbal agreement. In many places, verbal contracts can be legally binding, but proving them is tough. The author might have a case if they can document the agreement, but since it's just a verbal \"gentleman's agreement,\" it's hard. The friend not paying could be a breach of contract, but the author's response might not be legal.\n\nThen, the author mentions having control over the domain and hosting because they're in the author's name. If the code is still being used, maybe there's a copyright issue. Copyright usually belongs to the creator unless transferred. If the author didn't transfer the rights, the friend might be infringing on the author's copyright by using the code without permission. In that case, the author could have legal grounds to take action, like demanding payment or stopping use.\n\nBut the author is thinking of \"completely fucking his shit over,\" which sounds like sabotage. Even if the author has a legal claim, taking retaliatory actions like destroying the website or POS system could be illegal. Sabotage could lead to criminal charges or civil liability. So while the friend might be in the wrong for not paying, the author's response could also be wrong.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the author felt betrayed and lost a friend. But using legal rights as a weapon through sabotage might cross a line. The ethical question is whether revenge is justified, even if there's a legal claim. The author might have valid grievances but need to pursue legal avenues instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nIn summary, the friend likely breached the agreement and possibly infringed on the author's copyright. However, the author's plan to disrupt the company could be illegal and unethical, even if the friend is at fault. So the author might not be entirely in the wrong in terms of the initial agreement, but their proposed actions are problematic.\n"
