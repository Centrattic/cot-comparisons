  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for potentially disrupting their friend's company. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a verbal agreement six years ago where the friend asked them to design a website and POS system. The agreement was $2000 plus 5% stake. But there's no written contract. The person worked on it, put other projects on hold, and the friend later ghosted them. Now the company is successful, and the friend hasn't paid anything. The person still has access to the domain, hosting, and some code, and the friend is using their POS system.\n\nSo the main question is whether it's wrong to disrupt the company to get their money and stake. Let's think about legal and ethical sides. Legally, verbal agreements can be enforceable, but it's harder without evidence. The person might have a case, but proving the terms could be tough. Ethically, the friend broke the agreement and ghosted, which is bad. But retaliating by disrupting the company could be seen as harmful, even if the friend was wrong.\n\nAlso, the person mentions they have access to the domain and code. If they take those down, it could hurt the company. But is that justified? Maybe they should try legal means first, like sending a demand letter or going to court. Taking matters into their own hands might lead to legal trouble for the person too, like sabotage or theft of property. Even if the friend didn't pay, destroying the company's assets isn't a legal solution. So legally, the person might be in the wrong if they disrupt the company without going through proper channels. Ethically, it's a gray area\u2014the friend was unfair, but revenge isn't the answer. The right approach would be to seek legal recourse rather than take direct action.\n"
