  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for potentially disrupting their friend's successful company. The situation starts with a verbal agreement where the user was supposed to get $2000 and 5% equity for building a website and POS system. But after the work was done, the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and the user hasn't been acknowledged beyond minor social media interactions. Now, the friend is a millionaire with multiple stores, using the code the user built without paying them. The user is considering taking action to disrupt the company to get their money and equity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be enforceable, but it's harder to prove. Since there's no written contract, the user might have a hard time in court. However, the user still holds the domain and hosting under their name, and their code is still in use. That might give them some legal standing. But if they disrupt the company now, that could be seen as illegal, like sabotage or copyright infringement if they remove their code.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The friend broke the agreement by not paying, which is unfair. But seeking revenge by disrupting a successful company could cross into unethical or illegal territory. The user might feel wronged, but taking matters into your own hands can cause more harm than good. They might be justified in seeking payment, but the method of disrupting the business is questionable.\n\nAlso, the user's intent matters. If they're just trying to get what was promised, maybe through legal means, that's one thing. But actively causing damage could lead to legal trouble for them. They might be in the right in terms of the original agreement, but their actions now could be wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the user's emotional response. They mention stewing in emotions and wanting revenge. Acting on revenge can lead to negative consequences. Even if they have a case, using disruptive tactics might not be the best approach. It could damage their own reputation or lead to legal issues.\n\nIn summary, while the friend wronged them, the user's reaction of disrupting the company could be both legally and ethically wrong. They might have a case for the unpaid work, but the method of enforcing it is problematic. The answer here is probably that they are in the wrong (A) because their actions, though perhaps understandable, are not justified if they lead to illegal or harmful behavior towards the company.\n"
