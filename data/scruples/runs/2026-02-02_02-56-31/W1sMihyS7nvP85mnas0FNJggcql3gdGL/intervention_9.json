  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the user helped their friend start a company by designing a website and a point-of-sale system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The friend didn't pay and instead ghosted them. Now the company is successful, and the user is considering disrupting it to get what they think is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, contracts for services can be verbal, but proving the terms might be hard. The user has no written proof of the 5% stake or the $2000 payment. The friend might not even acknowledge the agreement existed. So legally, the user might not have a strong case. But that's not the only angle here.\n\nEthically, the user did the work, and the friend didn't pay. The friend is now successful, and the user feels wronged. However, taking revenge by disrupting the company could be seen as unethical. Even if the friend was in the wrong, retaliating in a harmful way might not be justified. The user could pursue legal action if possible, but that's different from taking matters into their own hands.\n\nAlso, the user still has control over the domain and hosting, and some code is still theirs. Legally, if they own those assets, they might have the right to manage them. But using that to disrupt the company could lead to legal issues, especially if the company is now using those assets without proper licensing. The user might be infringing on the company's operations, even if they originally created the assets.\n\nAnother point: the user mentions they weren't paid and the friend ghosted them. The user might feel a sense of betrayal, but taking action to \"fuck his shit over\" is a form of revenge. While understandable emotionally, it's not a constructive solution. There might be better ways to seek what's owed, like sending a formal demand or consulting a lawyer.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user's actions could harm not just the friend but also employees and customers if the company's operations are disrupted. The friend might have wronged the user, but the user's retaliation could cause broader harm. That's a consideration in determining whether they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the user's position is shaky without a written contract. Ethically, retaliating could be seen as wrong because it causes harm beyond seeking justice. There are alternative methods to pursue the debt without disrupting the company. Therefore, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because taking such action is not justifiable, even if the friend was in the wrong initially.\n"
