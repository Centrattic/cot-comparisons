  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong if they disrupt their friend's successful company. The background is a verbal agreement from six years ago where they were supposed to get $2000 and 5% equity for building a website and POS system. The friend ghosted them after the work was done and is now a millionaire with multiple stores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. While some contracts are enforceable verbally, others require written form, especially for equity stakes. The user hasn't received payment or equity, which could be a breach of contract. However, without a written agreement, proving the terms might be tough in court. The user still owns the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. That could be a point in their favor regarding intellectual property rights.\n\nBut here's the catch: the friend has been using their work for years without payment. The user hasn't taken legal action yet. If they decide to disrupt the company now, it's a form of retaliation. Legally, even if they have valid claims, taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the business could lead to legal repercussions for the user, like charges of sabotage or theft. The friend might also have defenses, such as arguing that the verbal agreement isn't enforceable or that the statute of limitations has passed for certain claims.\n\nEthically, there's a gray area. The user was wronged by not getting paid and being ghosted. But taking revenge by harming the company could be seen as crossing a line. The friend's actions were unethical, but the user's response could also be considered unethical or even illegal. The user might feel justified, but the method they're considering is extreme.\n\nAnother angle: the user has leverage because they own the domain and code. Legally, they could potentially demand payment or compensation through proper channels, like sending a cease and desist or going to small claims court. However, if they instead choose to disrupt operations, it's not just a matter of being right or wrong; it's about the legality of their actions versus the legitimacy of their claim.\n\nIn summary, the user might have a valid claim, but their method of enforcing it could be both legally problematic and ethically questionable. They might not be in the wrong morally if their claim is valid, but acting out in this way could make them legally liable. So, while the friend wronged them, the user's retaliation could also be wrong depending on how it's executed.\n"
