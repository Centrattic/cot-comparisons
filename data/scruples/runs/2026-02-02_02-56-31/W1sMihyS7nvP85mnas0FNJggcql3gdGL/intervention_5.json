  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for disrupting my \"friend\"'s multi-million-dollar company?\nSix years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person in question helped a friend start a company by designing a website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement involving $2000 and a 5% stake. However, after the work was done, the friend ghosted them, leading to no payment or acknowledgment. Now, the friend is successful, and the person is considering disrupting the company.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. A verbal agreement can be legally binding, but it's often hard to enforce without evidence. Since there's no written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. The person might not have a legal claim for the 5% stake or the $2000 because there's no written proof, especially if they didn't take steps to document the agreement.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't honor the agreement, which is unfair. The person worked hard, put other projects aside, and contributed significantly to the company's success. The friend's actions of ghosting and not acknowledging the work are inconsiderate and possibly unethical. However, seeking revenge by disrupting the company could lead to legal trouble. Even if the person still owns the domain and code, using that to sabotage could be illegal, regardless of the past injustice.\n\nThe person's anger and feeling of betrayal are valid. But taking destructive actions might not be the right approach. Instead, they might need to pursue legal avenues if possible, like small claims court for the $2000 if they can prove the verbal agreement. Disrupting the company could result in charges like sabotage or breach of contract, even if the original terms were verbal.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is important. The person felt their friendship was broken, and they weren't invited to a major life event. This adds to their hurt. However, revenge might not be the healthiest response. They might need to accept that they can't get their friend back and focus on moving forward, perhaps seeking what they're owed through proper channels if possible.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's actions were wrong, the person considering sabotage would likely be in the wrong legally and ethically. They need to explore legal options for what's owed to them rather than resorting to revenge, which could have serious consequences.\n"
