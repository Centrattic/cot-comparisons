He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they disrupt their friend's company. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, there was a verbal agreement six years ago. The friend wanted a website and POS system. The author, a recent CS grad, worked on it for two weeks, then six more weeks for tweaks. They had a verbal deal for $2000 plus 5% stake. The friend also hired a designer who got $2000 upfront but no stake. After the work was done, the friend ghosted the author, cutting off communication. Now the company is successful, the friend is a millionaire, and the author hasn't been paid. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, and some of their code is still in use. They're considering disrupting the company to get what they believe is owed.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, verbal agreements can be hard to enforce, especially without evidence. The author might not have a strong case in court. However, ethically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is unfair. The author's actions, like disrupting the company, could be seen as revenge, which might not be justified even if the friend was in the wrong. But the friend's behavior of ghosting and not paying is also unethical.\n\nThe author has a valid grievance, but taking retaliatory actions could be illegal, like sabotage. Even if the author owns the domain and hosting, there might be terms of service violations if they take it down. Also, the friend's use of the code without payment is a breach, but the author's response could cross legal lines.\n\nSo, while the friend was clearly wrong, the author's potential actions could be illegal and unethical. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for considering sabotage despite the friend's breach of trust.\n"
