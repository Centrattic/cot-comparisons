  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" They explain that their parents divorced, then their mom remarried two years ago. The stepdad is okay but hasn't connected with them, there are arguments between the mom and stepdad, and when the mom called him \"your father,\" the user said \"he's not my dad.\" The mom got angry, said they were ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around family terms. In many cases, people might expect a child to adopt terms for stepparents, but it's not a universal rule. The user's issue is that the stepdad hasn't made an effort to connect, and their relationship is strained. The user's response was factual and calm, but the mom took offense. \n\nIs the user wrong for holding boundaries? If the stepdad isn't fulfilling the role of a father, it's reasonable for the user to not use the term \"Dad.\" The mom might feel rejected, but that's a different issue. The user's stance isn't malicious; it's about authenticity. The mom's reaction is intense, but that doesn't mean the user is in the wrong. They have a right to feel how they do about the relationship. So, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
