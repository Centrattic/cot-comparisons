  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: parents divorced, mom remarried. The stepfather isn't close with the user, they argue a lot, and there's tension. The mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" and the user responded that he's not their dad. Mom got angry, said they're ungrateful, and hasn't spoken since.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around family terms. In many cases, people use terms like \"Dad\" for biological fathers, and stepfathers might be called by their name or another title. However, some families choose to use \"Dad\" for stepfathers, which can depend on how close the relationship is.\n\nThe user's stepfather isn't close, there's been arguments, and the user feels he hasn't tried to get to know them. So the user's reluctance to call him \"Dad\" might be because they don't see him as a father figure. The mom's reaction could stem from wanting to legitimize the stepfather in the family dynamic, expecting the user to accept him as a father.\n\nBut is the user wrong for not using the term? It's about respect and family dynamics. The user isn't being disrespectful, just stating a fact. The mom might feel hurt or rejected, but the user's stance is rooted in their actual relationship with the stepfather. \n\nCulturally, it's not necessarily wrong to avoid using a title that doesn't feel genuine. However, the impact on family relationships is important. The user might need to communicate their feelings to the mom to understand each other's perspectives. But in terms of right or wrong, it's more about the mom's expectations clashing with the user's reality. The user isn't in the wrong for not using the term if the relationship doesn't support it.\n"
