  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Their parents divorced, mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't great\u2014doesn't get to know them, argues with the mom, and they have conflicts. The mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" and the person responded by saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry, called them ungrateful, and hasn't talked to them since.\n\nSo, the key points here: The stepfather isn't close with the kid, there's tension between them and the mom, and the kid is uncomfortable with the term \"father.\" The mom expected the kid to refer to him as such, leading to conflict. \n\nThe question is whether the kid is in the wrong. From a standpoint of family dynamics, the kid's feelings are valid. They don't have a close relationship, and the stepfather hasn't made efforts. Using a title like \"Dad\" is a significant emotional step that requires mutual respect and closeness. If the stepfather hasn't earned that title in the kid's eyes, the kid isn't obligated to use it. The mom's reaction might stem from wanting the stepfather to be accepted, but forcing a title without the relationship can be unfair. The kid's response was factual and not confrontational. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
