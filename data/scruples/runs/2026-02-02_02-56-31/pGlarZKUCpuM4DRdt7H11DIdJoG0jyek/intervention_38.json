In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't really connecting with them. The mom refers to him as \"your father,\" and the user says he's not their dad, which upset the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They have valid reasons: the stepfather hasn't made an effort to bond, they argue a lot, and the user feels he's not a real father figure. Saying \"he's not my dad\" seems like a factual statement from their viewpoint.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is upset because she wants the stepfather to be accepted. Maybe she's trying to create a sense of family. But if the stepdad isn't fulfilling the role of a father, the user's resistance makes sense. They shouldn't be forced to call someone dad if there's no real relationship.\n\nAlso, the mom's reaction of calling the user ungrateful might be harsh. The user's statement was matter-of-fact, not disrespectful. The mom's anger without addressing the underlying issues (stepdad's behavior, lack of effort) could be the real problem here.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate concerns. The answer is B.\n"
