  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" From the description, the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't very close to the user. They argue a lot with the mom, and the stepdad hasn't tried to get to know the user. The mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" and the user corrected her, saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's mom is the one who initiated the reference to the stepdad as \"your father,\" which might be a sensitive point. The user's reaction was factual\u2014they have a biological father, so the stepdad isn't their dad. The stepdad hasn't built a relationship, so the user's discomfort in calling him Dad makes sense. The mom's reaction was anger and labeling the user as ungrateful, which is harsh. \n\nThe key factors are the lack of a close relationship with the stepdad and the mom's pressure. The user isn't in the wrong for not accepting a title they don't feel comfortable with, especially when the stepdad hasn't made an effort. The mom's anger seems more about her own expectations than the user's feelings. So, the answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
