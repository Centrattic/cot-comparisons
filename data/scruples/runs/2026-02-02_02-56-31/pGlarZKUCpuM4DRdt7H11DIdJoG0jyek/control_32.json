  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that after their parents' divorce and their mom's remarriage, the stepfather hasn't really connected with them. They argue a lot, and the stepfather isn't nice. When the mom calls him \"your father,\" the author says he's not their dad, which leads to the mom being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author isn't obligated to use a title they're uncomfortable with. Family titles often come with emotional connotations. If the stepfather hasn't built a relationship, it's natural for the author to feel that \"Dad\" isn't appropriate. The mom might want the stepfather to be seen as a father figure, but the author's feelings are valid if the relationship isn't there.\n\nBut the mom's reaction is also a factor. She called the author ungrateful and hasn't spoken to them since. That's a strong reaction. The author's response was factual, not aggressive. The mom's anger might stem from her desire to integrate the stepfather into the family, but the author's refusal to use the title could be seen as resistance to that integration. However, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their discomfort. They have a right to set boundaries, especially if the stepfather isn't fulfilling a fatherly role.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that the author is being disrespectful by not using the title. But the title \"Dad\" implies a relationship that isn't present. So, the author isn't wrong for not wanting to use it. The mom's anger might be misplaced if she's expecting a title without the underlying relationship. The stepfather's behavior (arguing with the mom, not getting to know the author) also plays a role here. The author's resistance could be a way of expressing that the stepfather isn't a positive influence.\n\nIn summary, the author's refusal to call the stepfather \"Dad\" is a valid expression of their feelings, especially given the stepfather's behavior. The mom's reaction is harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for stating their truth. They are not obligated to use a title that doesn't feel right to them.\n"
