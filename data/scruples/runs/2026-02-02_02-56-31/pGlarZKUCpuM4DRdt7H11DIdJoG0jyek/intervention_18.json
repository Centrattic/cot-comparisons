  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" So their parents got divorced, their mom remarried, and they don't really get along with the stepdad. The mom calls him \"your father,\" and the user says he's not their dad, which upset the mom. The user is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather is not a biological parent, so the user not calling him \"Dad\" might be a boundary they're setting. The stepdad hasn't tried to build a relationship and they argue a lot. The mom is upset because the user hasn't accepted him. \n\nFrom the user's perspective, it's understandable they feel uncomfortable. They might not have a bond, and the stepdad hasn't made an effort. Using a title like \"Dad\" feels forced if there's no real relationship. The user's statement was factual, not aggressive, so maybe they're just being honest.\n\nThe mom's reaction could be coming from feeling that the user isn't respecting the new family structure. She might want the user to accept the stepdad to maintain family harmony. But if the stepdad hasn't tried to connect, forcing the user to call him \"Dad\" might be unfair. The user isn't obligated to use a title they feel doesn't apply. \n\nAlso, the stepdad's behavior\u2014arguing with the mom and not getting to know the user\u2014might contribute to the user's reluctance. The user isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use a term that doesn't feel right. The mom's anger might stem from frustration, but the user's right to set boundaries is valid. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
