In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Their parents divorced, mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't really trying to connect with them. They argue a lot, and the mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" which led to conflict.\n\nHmm. First, family dynamics can be tricky. The stepdad hasn't tried to get to know the user and they've had arguments. The user isn't comfortable with calling him dad. The mom got angry when the user said he's not their dad. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, the user's feelings are valid. They have a right to feel how they do about their relationships. The stepdad isn't fulfilling the role of a father figure, so expecting the user to call him \"Dad\" might be unreasonable. The mom might be projecting her own expectations onto the user. \n\nBut maybe the user could have handled the situation more tactfully. Instead of saying \"he's not my dad,\" maybe explaining their feelings. But the user's response was a matter of fact, not angry. The mom's reaction seems harsh. \n\nSo, considering the stepdad's behavior and the lack of effort from him, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
