In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't really close with them. They had some arguments, and when the mom referred to him as \"your father,\" the user objected. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is living with their mom and stepdad. The stepdad hasn't tried to get to know them, and their interactions are strained. The user's mom is pushing for the stepdad to be called \"Dad,\" which the user resists. The mom's anger at the user's refusal might stem from feeling that the user is rejecting the new marriage.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? Well, the user has valid reasons for not feeling comfortable with the title. If the stepdad hasn't built a relationship or has been argumentative, it's natural to not see him as a father figure. The mom's reaction might be out of proportion, especially if the user's statement was a factual correction rather than an insult. It's also important that a child should feel comfortable in their own family dynamics. There's no obligation to adopt a title if it doesn't feel right, especially if the relationship isn't there. The mom might need to understand the user's perspective instead of getting angry. So, probably the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
