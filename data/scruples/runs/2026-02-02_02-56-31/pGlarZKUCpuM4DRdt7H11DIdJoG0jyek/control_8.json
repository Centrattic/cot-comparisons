In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a divorce, remarriage, and tension between the stepfather and the author. \n\nFirst, the author's mom remarried two years ago. The stepfather hasn't really tried to connect with the author, and they often argue. The mom calls him \"your father,\" which the author corrects by saying he's not their dad. The mom then gets angry, calls the author ungrateful, and stops talking to them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not using the term \"Dad\" for someone who isn't their biological father. The author's reasoning is that their mom and stepfather argue a lot, and the stepfather hasn't made an effort to bond. The mom's reaction is anger and feeling ungrateful.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around family terms. In many cases, people do refer to step-parents as \"Mom\" or \"Dad,\" especially if they've been raised together. However, if the relationship is strained or the step-parent isn't involved, it's common for children to resist that term. The author's mom might expect them to use it for integration into the new family, but the author feels it's inauthentic given the circumstances.\n\nThe key points here are the stepfather's lack of engagement and the mom's insistence on the title. The author's response was factual but might have come off as dismissive. However, the mother's reaction seems harsh. It's a matter of perspective\u2014whether the title is important for the family dynamic or if the author's feelings are valid given the interpersonal issues.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's no absolute answer, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a valid reason for not using the term, especially if it feels forced. The mother's reaction might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author wrong for expressing their genuine feelings. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
