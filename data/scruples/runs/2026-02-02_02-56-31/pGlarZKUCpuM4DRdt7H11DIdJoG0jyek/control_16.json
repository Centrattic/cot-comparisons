  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's parents divorced, and the mom remarried. The stepfather hasn't really tried to connect with the author, they argue a lot, and the author isn't close to him. When the mom calls the stepfather \"your father,\" the author corrects her, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the stepfather isn't a father figure because they don't have a good relationship. The mom is upset because she wants the author to accept him as a parent. \n\nI need to consider if the author was wrong. The key points are the stepfather's lack of effort to build a relationship, their arguments, and the mom's insistence on the title. The author's refusal seems based on reality\u2014they don't share a father-son/daughter bond. Titles like \"Dad\" are personal and depend on the relationship. If the stepfather isn't acting like a father, it's reasonable for the author not to use that term. The mom's anger might stem from her own expectations, but the author isn't obligated to use a title they're uncomfortable with. So the answer is likely B (author not in the wrong).\n"
