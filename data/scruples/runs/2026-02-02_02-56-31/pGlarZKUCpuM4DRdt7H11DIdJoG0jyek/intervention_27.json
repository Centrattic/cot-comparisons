  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" Here's the situation: the parents got divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't really trying to connect. The user and stepdad argue a lot, and the mom and stepdad also argue. When the mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" the user said he's not their dad. The mom got angry, called them ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They live with their mom and stepdad, but the stepdad hasn't made an effort to build a relationship. The user feels the stepdad isn't their father, which is a personal and emotional stance. They might feel that the title \"Dad\" implies a closer relationship that doesn't exist. The user's response was a factual statement, not angry, but it upset the mom. \n\nThen there's the mom's reaction. She might feel that the user isn't respecting their new family structure or showing gratitude for the stepdad's presence. She could see the user's refusal as rejection, which is why she's angry. However, the user's stance is about their own feelings and experiences, not just defiance. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, family dynamics can be complex, especially after divorce. The user might be struggling with loyalty to their biological father, or feeling pressured to accept a new parent. The stepdad's lack of effort might make the title feel insincere. \n\nLegally, the stepdad's status as a parent can vary by jurisdiction, but emotionally, the user has the right to define their relationship. The mom's anger might stem from feeling that her new marriage isn't being respected, but she should also consider her child's feelings and the stepdad's shortcomings.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user isn't being disrespectful by not using the title if they don't feel comfortable. The mom's reaction might be more about her own feelings of rejection or pressure to integrate the stepdad. However, the user could have approached the situation differently to explain their feelings instead of a blunt statement. But the core issue is the stepdad's lack of engagement and the user's right to define their relationship. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards the user not being in the wrong because they're expressing their genuine feelings and the stepdad hasn't built a fatherly relationship. The mom's reaction is valid in some contexts, but the user's stance is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
