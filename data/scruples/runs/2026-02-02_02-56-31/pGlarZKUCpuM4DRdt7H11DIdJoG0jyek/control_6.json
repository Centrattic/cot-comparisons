In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\"\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The parents are divorced, the mom remarried someone the author isn't close to. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to get to know the author, there's conflict between the mom and stepdad, and the author's mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" which led to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings and the stepfather's behavior. The author clearly states they don't have a good relationship with their stepdad. They mention he's not been nice, they argue, and he hasn't tried to get to know them. The mom expects the author to refer to him as \"Dad,\" which the author refuses, leading to the mom being upset.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The mother might feel hurt because she wants the stepfather to be accepted as part of the family. But the author's refusal is based on their negative experiences and lack of a bond. It's important to note that the author isn't forcing the relationship; they're expressing their feelings honestly. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to build the relationship either. \n\nIn such cases, it's common for children to struggle with accepting a stepparent, especially if the stepparent hasn't established a positive relationship. The author's response was factual and not confrontational. The mother's anger might stem from her own expectations versus the reality of the situation. The author's responsibility isn't to force a title or a relationship if it doesn't feel authentic. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their feelings. The issue might be more about the mother's expectations and the stepfather's lack of effort. The author's right to feel and express their discomfort is valid here.\n"
