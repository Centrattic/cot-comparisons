In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" They mention that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't very nice to them. The mom got angry when the user said he's not their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and familial expectations. In some families, step-parents are expected to be addressed as mom or dad, but that's not universal. The user's stepdad hasn't tried to bond with them and there's been a lot of arguing. So maybe the user isn't wrong in feeling that it's not appropriate to call him Dad. \n\nBut then, the mom's reaction is part of the issue. She might feel that the stepfather should be respected as their father now. However, the user's right to not have to call someone \"Dad\" if they feel uncomfortable is also valid. The stepdad not being nice and not making an effort could support the user's stance. \n\nAlso, the user's statement was matter of fact, not angry. The mom's anger might be more about her own feelings than the user being an asshole. \n\nSo, in terms of justification, the user's resistance isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's about personal feelings and the stepdad's behavior. The answer probably leans towards B, No, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
