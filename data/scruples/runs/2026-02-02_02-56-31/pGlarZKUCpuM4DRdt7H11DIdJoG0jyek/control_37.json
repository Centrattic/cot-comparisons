In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The key points here are the strained relationship between the stepfather and the author, the mother's insistence on using the term \"father,\" and the resulting conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The parents are divorced, the mother remarried, and the stepfather hasn't really tried to connect with the author. They argue a lot, and the author feels that the stepfather isn't nice. The author's honest reaction when the mother called the stepfather \"your father\" was to say he's not their dad. The mother was upset, calling the author ungrateful.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, a person is not obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel a fatherly bond. The stepfather's behavior\u2014arguing with the mother and not making an effort to get to know the child\u2014doesn't foster that relationship. The author's response was factual and not confrontational. The mother's anger might stem from feeling that the child isn't accepting her new partner, but the author's stance is about personal feelings and reality. \n\nSociety often pressures children to accept step-parents, but that doesn't mean it's fair if there's no genuine relationship. The stepfather isn't a biological father, and if he hasn't acted like one, the author's refusal to use the term isn't wrong. The mother's reaction seems harsh given the circumstances. The author isn't in the wrong here; they're expressing their true feelings. So the answer is B.\n"
