In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that their parents divorced, mom remarried. The stepdad isn't great\u2014they argue a lot, and he hasn't really tried to get to know them. The user and stepdad have had arguments too. The mom called him \"your father,\" the user said he's not their dad, mom got angry and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nHmm. First, the user's feelings here are valid. They have a strained relationship with their stepfather. If someone isn't acting like a father figure and the relationship is rocky, it's natural to feel uncomfortable using the term \"Dad.\" Using family titles is personal and depends on the relationship. The mom might want them to use the title to feel closer, but if the stepdad hasn't earned that role, the user isn't wrong to resist. \n\nAlso, the stepdad's behavior is mentioned as being not nice and not trying to connect. That adds to the user's justification. The mom getting angry and calling the user ungrateful seems harsh. It's possible the mom is feeling defensive or wants to enforce a new family dynamic, but that doesn't make the user wrong for expressing their feelings. \n\nHowever, maybe the mom feels the user is rejecting her choice in a partner or the new family structure. But the user's right to feel how they do isn't negated by that. The key here is that using a title like \"Dad\" is a personal choice and shouldn't be forced if the relationship isn't there. So the answer is probably B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
