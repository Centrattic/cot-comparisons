  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves their parents' divorce, remarriage, and the stepfather not being very involved or kind. The mother called the stepfather \"your father,\" and the user reacted by saying \"he's not my dad,\" leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user lives with their mom and the stepdad, but their relationship with him is strained. The stepdad hasn't tried to connect much, and there are frequent arguments. The user's refusal to use \"Dad\" is likely due to not feeling a fatherly bond. The mom's reaction is anger, calling the user ungrateful. \n\nLegally, the stepfather isn't a biological parent, so there's no legal obligation to refer to him as \"Dad.\" Emotionally, the user's stance makes sense if the relationship isn't paternal. The mother might feel that the user isn't accepting the new family structure, but that doesn't necessarily make the user wrong. The stepdad's lack of effort to build a relationship could be a key point here. The user isn't at fault for not feeling a connection. The mother's anger might be more about her own feelings of rejection or pressure to make the marriage work. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
