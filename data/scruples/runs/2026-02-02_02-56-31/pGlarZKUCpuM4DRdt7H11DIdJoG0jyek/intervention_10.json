In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" They explain that their mom remarried after a divorce, and the stepfather isn't close to them. They argue a lot, and the stepdad hasn't tried to get to know the user. The mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" and the user disagreed, saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry, called them ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since. The user wants to know if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user lives with their mom and stepfather, but the stepfather hasn't made an effort to build a relationship. The user's resistance to calling him \"Dad\" seems based on their lack of connection and the stepfather's behavior. The mom's reaction is to label the user as ungrateful and not accepting, which could be a defense mechanism or a way to enforce a family norm.\n\nIs the user wrong for not wanting to use a title that doesn't feel right to them? Well, family dynamics are complex. The stepfather isn't a biological parent, and if he hasn't established a fatherly role, the user isn't obligated to use that title. Respecting someone's relationship with their partner doesn't mean you have to adopt the same titles if it feels forced. The user's mom might be struggling with the idea that her child isn't accepting her new husband, but the user's feelings are valid if there's no genuine relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's response was direct, which might have been hurtful. Maybe there's a way to express their feelings without being confrontational. But the core issue is whether the user is wrong for not calling him \"Dad.\" Since the stepfather hasn't earned that title through effort or connection, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The mom's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the user the asshole. The stepfather's lack of effort is also a factor here. The user's right to set boundaries in their relationship with him is important. So the answer is B.\n"
