  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" They explained that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't very close with them. The mom referred to the stepdad as \"your father,\" and the user objected. The mom got angry, calling them ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The user's mom wants them to call the stepdad \"Dad,\" but the user feels that's not appropriate given the strained relationship. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to connect and they argue often.\n\nFrom a familial perspective, some might argue that respecting the stepfather as a parent figure is important, especially if the mom expects it. But on the other hand, the user has reasons not to feel comfortable using that term. The stepdad's behavior and the mom's remarriage after divorce don't automatically make him a father figure in the eyes of the child.\n\nThe user's response was factual, not angry, which might mean they're just stating a truth about their relationship. The mom's anger could stem from feeling that the user isn't respecting her new marriage or the stepdad's position. But the user's right to feel that way is valid because the term \"Dad\" implies a level of relationship and acceptance that isn't there.\n\nI should consider cultural norms here. Some cultures strongly emphasize family roles, while others are more flexible. However, the user's justification for not using the term is based on the stepdad's lack of effort and their own negative interactions. That's a legitimate reason for the user's stance.\n\nThe mom's reaction might be harsh, expecting the user to accept a role without reciprocal effort from the stepdad. The user isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if the relationship isn't authentic. So, the user isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings. The problem might be more about the mom's expectations versus the user's actual experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their stance, and the mom's anger might be misplaced. The key is the mutual respect and the stepdad's role in the family. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
