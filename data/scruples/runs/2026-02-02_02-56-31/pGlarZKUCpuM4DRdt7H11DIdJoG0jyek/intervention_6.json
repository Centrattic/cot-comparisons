In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a divorce, remarriage, and some tension with the stepdad. The mom got upset when the user said he's not their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The user lives with their mom and stepdad, but the stepdad hasn't really connected with them. They argue a lot, so the user probably doesn't feel a close bond. The mom is upset because the user isn't accepting her husband as a father figure. But is that the user's responsibility?\n\nLegally, the stepdad isn't a parent, so there's no obligation to call them dad. Emotionally, though, the mom might feel rejected. But the user has valid reasons: the stepdad hasn't tried to connect, and the relationship is strained. The user's response was factual, not hostile. The mom's anger seems more about her feelings than the user's actual behavior.\n\nIn many cultures, calling someone \"Dad\" is a choice, not a requirement. If the user isn't comfortable, it's their right. The mother might need to work on her expectations. So, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
