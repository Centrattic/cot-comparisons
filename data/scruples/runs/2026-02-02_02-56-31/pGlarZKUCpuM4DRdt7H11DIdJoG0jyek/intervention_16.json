  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really tried to get close. The user and stepdad have had arguments, and the mom called him \"your father,\" prompting the user to say he's not their dad. The mom got angry, called them ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is probably in a tough spot. After a divorce and remarriage, family roles can be complicated. The user hasn't had a good relationship with the stepfather, so calling him \"Dad\" might feel forced or inauthentic. On the other hand, the mom might feel that the user is rejecting the new family structure or being disrespectful by not using the term she expects.\n\nIt's important to note that the user didn't say it angrily but as a factual statement. The mom's reaction could stem from feeling that the user is being ungrateful for the effort she's made to remarry and create a new family. However, the user's right to feel how they do should also be considered. If the stepfather hasn't built a relationship and there's tension, the user's discomfort is valid. The mom's anger might be overreacting to a legitimate boundary set by the user.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. In family matters like this, it's often not a simple right or wrong. However, the user isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel comfortable, especially if the relationship isn't there. The key points are the user's feelings being genuine and the mom's reaction being excessive. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
