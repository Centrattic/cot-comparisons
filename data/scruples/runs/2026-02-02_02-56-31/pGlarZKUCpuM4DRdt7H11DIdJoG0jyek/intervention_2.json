  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't very close with them. The mom calls the stepdad \"your father,\" and the user reacts by saying he's not their dad, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The user lives with their mom and stepdad, but the stepdad hasn't made an effort to connect. There are frequent arguments between the parents. The user's response was factual but maybe not diplomatic. The mom got upset, feeling ungrateful.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, family terms can be personal. If the stepfather isn't acting like a father figure, insisting on the term \"Dad\" might be unreasonable. The user's perspective is valid because titles carry emotional weight. However, the mom might feel that using \"Dad\" is about acceptance and respect for her new relationship. But if the stepdad isn't fulfilling the role, the user's resistance is understandable. The mom's anger could be more about her own expectations than the user's actual wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, the stepdad's behavior (not trying to get to know them, arguing) affects this. The user isn't obligated to accept a title they don't feel comfortable with. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). They have a right to how they refer to people, especially if the relationship isn't there.\n"
