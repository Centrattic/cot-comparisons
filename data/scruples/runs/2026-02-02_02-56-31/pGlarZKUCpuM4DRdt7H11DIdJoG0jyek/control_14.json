In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The user's parents are divorced, and their mom has remarried. The stepfather, who they live with now, isn't great\u2014doesn't really try to get to know them, argues a lot with the mom, and their interactions are tense. The mom refers to him as \"your father,\" and the user says he's not their dad. The mom then gets angry, calls them ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the user's perspective. They don't have a good relationship with their stepfather. He hasn't made an effort to connect, and there are frequent arguments. The user feels that calling him \"Dad\" is inappropriate because of their strained relationship. They made a factual statement that he's not their father, which the mom took as disrespectful. The user didn't say it angrily, just matter-of-factly.\n\nFrom the mom's side, she might feel that the user isn't respecting the new family structure. Remarrying and expecting the stepchild to accept the stepfather as a father figure could be important to her, especially if she wants to present a united front. The user's refusal might hurt her feelings because she's trying to integrate the new spouse into the family.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The user's feelings are valid. If the stepfather isn't acting like a father figure, it's reasonable for them not to call him by that title. The term \"father\" usually implies a certain level of relationship and authority, which might not exist here. However, the user's response might come off as dismissive or disrespectful, depending on the context. But the user didn't use an angry tone, just stated a fact.\n\nThe mom's reaction is also a factor. If she's pushing for the user to accept the stepfather despite his behavior, there might be issues in her approach. The stepfather's behavior (not getting to know the child, arguments) is problematic, and the user isn't obligated to call him \"Dad\" if there's no genuine father-son relationship.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user isn't wrong for standing by their feelings. The problem might lie in communication. The user could have explained their feelings more clearly instead of just stating the fact. However, the stepfather's actions also play a role here. If he's not making an effort, it's unreasonable to expect the user to address him as such.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The situation is complex, but their perspective is valid given the circumstances. The mom's anger might stem from her own expectations not being met, but the user's stance is justified based on their experiences.\n"
