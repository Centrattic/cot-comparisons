  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a recent divorce, remarriage, and tension in the household. The mother refers to the stepfather as \"your father,\" which the child objects to, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the user's perspective: They don't feel a connection to their stepfather. He hasn't made an effort to get to know them, there are frequent arguments, and the relationship is strained. The user sees the stepfather as not their real father, so using \"Dad\" feels inauthentic. Their response was factual, not angry, but the mother took offense, calling them ungrateful and not accepting the stepfather.\n\nNow, considering the mother's reaction: She might be feeling hurt because the child isn't accepting her new husband. She might see it as rejecting her choice or not respecting the new family structure. Her anger could stem from a desire for the child to integrate the stepfather into their life, especially since they live together.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? It's about personal feelings and boundaries. The user isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if there's no genuine relationship. The stepfather's lack of effort and the existing tension might justify the user's stance. The mother's expectation might not be realistic given the circumstances. The user's response was honest, not malicious, so it's not necessarily wrong. The mother's reaction is harsh, possibly overreacting. So the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
