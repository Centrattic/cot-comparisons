  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" They explain that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and they don't have a good relationship with their stepdad. He's okay but distant, they argue a lot, and he hasn't tried to get close. The stepdad and mom argue a lot too. The user called him out when their mom referred to him as \"father,\" and the mom got angry, saying they're ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The user's mom is upset because they're not accepting the stepfather, which might be important to her. But the user has reasons: the stepfather hasn't made an effort, they argue, and the marriage seems unstable. The user's feelings are valid if they don't feel a paternal bond. It's about respect and their comfort. \n\nIs the user wrong for standing by their feelings? Probably not. They're not required to call someone a parent if they don't see them that way. The mom's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the user isn't obligated to comply if it's not genuine. The key is mutual respect. The user isn't being disrespectful; they're stating a fact. The mom's reaction could be harsh, but the user isn't in the wrong for expressing their true feelings. So answer B, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
