In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" So, the situation is that their parents got divorced, their mom remarried, and they don't get along well with the stepdad. The mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" and the user said he's not their dad. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user lives with their mom, who is remarried. The stepdad isn't close to them, argues with the mom, and their interactions are tense. The user's mom is upset because the user isn't accepting their stepdad as a father figure. The user's response was \"he's not my dad,\" which the mom took as being ungrateful.\n\nI should think about the user's perspective. They might feel that the stepdad hasn't earned the title of \"Dad\" through his actions. If the stepdad hasn't made an effort to connect, it's reasonable for the user to feel that calling him \"Dad\" is inappropriate. However, the mom's reaction is also valid because she might want the user to respect their new husband and integrate into the family.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? Well, the key here is consent and the emotional impact. The user isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel comfortable. They expressed their feelings matter-of-factly, which might have been a better approach than anger, but the mom's reaction is about feeling unappreciated. \n\nHowever, the user's stance isn't necessarily wrong. They have the right to their feelings and the right to not use a title that doesn't feel right to them. The mom's anger might stem from her desire for the family to be cohesive, but that doesn't mean the user is wrong for expressing their discomfort. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The user isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't share a fatherly bond with them.\n"
