  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" So, the situation is that their parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't really close with the kid. They have arguments, the stepdad doesn't seem to try to connect, and the mom is upset when the kid refuses to call him \"Dad.\" The mom is angry and hasn't spoken to the kid since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kid is upset about the stepdad's behavior and the arguments between the stepdad and mom. The mom is pushing for the kid to accept the stepdad as \"father,\" but the kid feels it's not appropriate given the circumstances. The key points here are the stepdad's lack of effort, the negative interactions, and the mom's reaction.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's often pressure to use certain terms for family roles, especially when parents are involved. However, personal feelings and relationships also matter. If the stepdad isn't fulfilling a fatherly role, the kid might feel it's disingenuous to call him \"Dad.\" The mom's anger could stem from feeling that the kid isn't respecting the new family structure, but the kid's resistance might be about genuine feelings and experiences.\n\nI need to check if the user's actions were justified. The kid isn't angry when stating the fact; it's more of a factual statement. The mom's anger might be a reaction to feeling rejected, but the kid's stance is based on their actual relationship. There's no clear right or wrong here, but more about personal feelings versus family expectations.\n\nAlso, considering that the stepdad and mom argue a lot and the stepdad doesn't try to get close, the kid's resistance seems reasonable. The mom's reaction might be harsh, expecting the kid to accept someone who hasn't earned that role. So, the kid isn't in the wrong here. They have valid reasons for their feelings, and the mom's reaction might be unwarranted.\n"
