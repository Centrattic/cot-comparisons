  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents got divorced, and the mom remarried. The stepfather isn't a big part of the user's life\u2014interactions are minimal and sometimes argue. The user's mom referred to the stepdad as \"your father,\" which upset the user. The user said, \"he's not my dad,\" which led to the mom getting angry and cutting off communication.\n\nI need to consider the user's perspective. They might feel that the stepfather hasn't made an effort to build a relationship, and the mom is pressuring them to accept someone who isn't a real father figure. The user's response was factual, not aggressive. The mom's reaction is emotional, possibly feeling rejected or feeling that the user is ungrateful.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might be trying to legitimize the stepfather's role in their life, which could be important for her new marriage. However, if the stepfather isn't providing a fatherly role, expecting the child to address him as \"Dad\" might be unreasonable.\n\nThe key points here are the stepfather's lack of involvement and the user's right to define familial relationships. In many cases, children are not obligated to call a step-parent by a title that doesn't feel genuine. The mom's anger might stem from feeling that the user isn't respecting her new partner, but the user's stance is based on their actual experiences.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not wanting to use \"Dad\" for someone who hasn't acted like a father. The mom's reaction might be excessive given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
