In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves their parents' divorce, a remarriage, and tension between the mother and stepfather. The user's mom got angry when they said the stepfather isn't their dad. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to build a relationship, they argue a lot, and the user clearly doesn't feel comfortable. The mom is upset because the user didn't accept the stepfather, leading to a fallout.\n\nIn many cases, family roles are fluid, especially in blended families. Using a term like \"Dad\" is a personal choice and can depend on the relationship's quality. If the stepfather hasn't tried to connect, it's reasonable for the user to not feel obligated to use that title. The mom's reaction seems harsh, especially since the user didn't express anger but just stated a fact. \n\nThe key points here are the stepfather's lack of engagement, the existing conflict, and the mom's reaction being out of proportion. The user isn't wrong for not wanting to call someone a parent if the relationship isn't there. So the answer leans towards B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
