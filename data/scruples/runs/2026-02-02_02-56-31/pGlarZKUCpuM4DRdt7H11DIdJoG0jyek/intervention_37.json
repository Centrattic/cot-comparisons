In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents are divorced. The mom remarried, so the stepdad is now part of the family. The user lives with their mom and the stepdad. They don't get along well with him\u2014there's arguing, he doesn't make an effort to know them, and the interactions are tense. The mom calls him \"your father,\" and the user objects, leading to a conflict where the mom is upset and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nI need to determine if the user is wrong for not calling him \"Dad.\" Let's consider the dynamics. The user's right to feel uncomfortable is important. Just because someone is married to a parent doesn't automatically make them a father figure. The stepdad hasn't built a relationship, so the user's resistance is understandable. However, the mom's perspective is that she wants the user to accept him as part of the new family structure.\n\nIs the user being ungrateful? Well, if the stepdad hasn't tried to connect or be a supportive father figure, the user's refusal might not be ungrateful but rather a reflection of the actual relationship. The mom's anger could stem from her desire for the user to accept him, but forcing a title when the relationship isn't there might not be fair.\n\nAlso, the stepdad's behavior\u2014arguing with the mom and not engaging with the child\u2014plays a role. The user isn't at fault for not wanting to use a title that doesn't feel earned. The mom might need to respect the user's feelings instead of pushing for a title that's causing tension. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. They have valid reasons for their stance. Answer B (not the asshole) makes sense.\n"
