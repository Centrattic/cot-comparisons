  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents divorced, mom remarried two years ago. The stepfather isn't close with the kid, they argue a lot, and the kid doesn't really have a good relationship with him. The mom starts calling him \"your father,\" and the kid responds that he's not their dad. The mom gets angry, says the kid is ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Well, the kid's feelings here are important. They have a strained relationship with their stepfather. The mom expects them to call him \"Dad\" after only two years of remarriage. The kid isn't comfortable with that. The mom is upset and labels the kid as ungrateful. \n\nI think the kid isn't in the wrong here. The stepfather hasn't tried to build a relationship, and the kid's feelings are valid. The mom's reaction seems harsh. The kid is just stating their feelings. So the answer is probably B. But let me check again. The mom might feel that the kid should respect her marriage, but if the stepfather isn't a good fit, the kid's resistance makes sense. The key factors are the stepfather's lack of effort and the kid's genuine discomfort. So the author isn't wrong.\n"
