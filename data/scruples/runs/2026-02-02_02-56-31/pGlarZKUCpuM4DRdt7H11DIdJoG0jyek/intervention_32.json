  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Their mom got remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really tried to connect with them. They argue a lot, and the user is uncomfortable referring to him as father. The mom got upset when the user said he's not their dad.\n\nHmm. Well, the user's perspective is that the stepdad isn't their actual biological father, and they have a strained relationship. The mom is pushing for the user to accept the stepdad as a father figure. But if the stepdad hasn't made an effort to build a relationship, maybe the user isn't wrong to resist calling him \"Dad.\" It's their choice how to refer to people, especially if the relationship isn't there. The mom getting angry for not accepting him might be because she wants the family to feel united, but the user's feelings are valid too. The key points are the lack of effort from the stepdad and the user's discomfort. So probably, the user isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
