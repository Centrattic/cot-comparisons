In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a recent divorce and remarriage. The stepfather hasn't really tried to build a relationship, there's a lot of arguing between him and the mom, and the user feels he's not nice. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the user says \"he's not my dad,\" which upsets her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's mom is likely trying to integrate the stepfather into their lives, maybe expecting the child to accept him as a father figure. But the user's experience with the stepfather has been negative\u2014arguments, lack of effort to get to know the user, and the stepfather being unkind. The user's refusal to call him \"Dad\" seems to stem from genuine discomfort and a lack of a positive relationship.\n\nIs the user wrong for not calling him Dad? Well, family roles can be complicated. If the stepfather hasn't earned that title through actions or if the user feels it's forced, then the user isn't necessarily at fault. The mom might be projecting her expectations onto the user, not considering the user's feelings or the stepfather's behavior. The user's response was factual and not confrontational, just stating a truth from their perspective.\n\nThe mom's reaction\u2014getting angry and calling the user ungrateful\u2014might indicate she's not acknowledging the user's valid feelings. The user's stance is about authentic relationships, not just labels. So, in this context, the user isn't in the wrong. Hence, the answer would be B.\n"
