In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't really close with the author. The mom started calling him \"your father,\" and the author objected, saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather and the author have a strained relationship. The stepfather hasn't tried to get to know the author and they argue. The mom is pushing the author to refer to him as \"father,\" but the author feels it's not right given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of rights, a child isn't obligated to use a parental title if they feel uncomfortable. The mom's reaction might be hurt because she wants her new spouse to be accepted. But the author's feelings are valid too, especially if the stepfather hasn't built a relationship. The mom's anger seems harsh, demanding acceptance without addressing the underlying issues. The stepfather's lack of effort could contribute to the author's resistance. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings. The key points are the strained relationship and the mother's reaction being disproportionate. The answer should be B.\n"
