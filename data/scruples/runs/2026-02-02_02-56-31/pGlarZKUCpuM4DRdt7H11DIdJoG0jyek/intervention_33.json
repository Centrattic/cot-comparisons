In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" They've been living with their mom and her new husband for two years. The stepdad isn't close to the user, there are arguments between him and the mom, and the user feels uncomfortable with the idea of calling him dad. The mom got upset when the user said he's not their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother wants the stepfather to be accepted as a father figure, but if the stepfather hasn't made efforts to build a relationship and there's existing tension, the user's reluctance might be justified. The user isn't wrong to feel that they don't have a father-son relationship. The mom's reaction could stem from her own expectations or feelings of rejection. But the user's stance isn't necessarily inconsiderate if they've tried to interact and it hasn't worked out. The key points are the lack of effort from the stepfather and the user's right to express their feelings. So, the answer would lean towards the user not being in the wrong.\n"
