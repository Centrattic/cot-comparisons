In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" Their mom got remarried, and the stepdad isn't close with them. They argue a lot, and the user feels uncomfortable. When the mom called him \"your father,\" the user said he's not their dad, which upset her. The question is whether the user is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The user lives with their mom and stepdad, but the stepdad hasn't made an effort to bond. It's been two years, and there's conflict. The user's mom is upset because she wants the user to accept her husband. But acceptance shouldn't be forced if the relationship isn't there. The user's response was factual\u2014they don't see him as their dad, so saying he's not their dad isn't necessarily wrong. It's about their feelings and the lack of connection. The mom's anger might be because she's disappointed, but the user's right to feel that way is valid. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no cultural expectation or something else. In many cases, calling a stepdad \"Dad\" is a personal choice. Forcing it can be alienating. If the stepdad hasn't earned that title, the user isn't wrong for not using it. So B makes sense.\n"
