In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't very involved or nice. The mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" and the user responded that he's not their dad. The mom got angry, said they were ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to get to know the user, there are arguments between the parents, and the user feels uncomfortable with the title. The user's response was factual but maybe not the best approach. But is it wrong to not want to use that title? It's a personal choice. The mom might be expecting the user to respect the stepdad, but if the stepdad hasn't earned that title, maybe it's justified. The user's feelings are valid if they haven't bonded with the stepdad. However, the user's reaction could have been more tactful. Instead of saying \"he's not my dad,\" maybe explaining their feelings would be better. But the mom's anger seems excessive. She's pushing for a relationship that the user isn't comfortable with. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
