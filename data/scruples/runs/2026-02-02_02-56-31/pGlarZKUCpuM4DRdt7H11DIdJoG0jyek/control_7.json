In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the writer refuses to call their stepfather \"Dad\" and had an argument with their mom about it. Their mom is upset and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents got divorced, mom remarried. The stepfather hasn't tried to get to know the kid, they argue a lot, and the mom and stepdad have issues. The kid says \"he's not my dad\" when the mom refers to him as \"your father.\" The mom got angry and now is not speaking to the kid.\n\nSo the question is whether the kid is in the wrong for not calling the stepfather \"Dad.\" Let's break it down. The kid has valid reasons: the stepfather hasn't made an effort to connect, they argue, and the stepfather isn't being nice. The kid is not forcing the relationship and is being honest about their feelings. On the other hand, the mom is upset because she wants the kid to accept her new husband. But is it reasonable to force a child to call someone \"Dad\"?\n\nIn many cases, the child has the right to feel uncomfortable with such a title if the stepfather isn't fulfilling the role. The mom's reaction might be overly harsh. The kid isn't being disrespectful just by stating a fact. The mom might be projecting her own expectations onto the child, not considering the child's feelings. So, the kid isn't in the wrong here. They're being honest about their relationship with the stepfather. The answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
