  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" Their mom got remarried two years ago, but there's tension. The stepdad isn't close with them and they've had arguments. The mom called him \"your father,\" and the user corrected her, saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry, called them ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, the user's feelings: They're not comfortable with the stepfather, who they describe as not making an effort to get to know them. There's conflict between him and the mom. The user's response was factual, not aggressive. They didn't lash out, just stated their position. The mom's reaction seems strong, maybe because she wants the user to accept the stepfather as a father figure.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, family dynamics can be complex, especially post-divorce and remarriage. The user's resistance might stem from genuine discomfort or unresolved issues with the stepfather. It's not uncommon for stepchildren to struggle with accepting a new parent, especially if the relationship isn't warm. The mom might feel hurt or rejected, seeing the user's refusal as a rejection of her choice.\n\nLegally, the stepfather isn't the user's biological father, so the term \"father\" might not be appropriate unless there's a legal adoption. But culturally, families often use terms like \"Dad\" for step-parents to create a sense of unity. However, that's a choice and can depend on the child's comfort level.\n\nIn this case, the user isn't being disrespectful\u2014they\u2019re just stating a fact based on their relationship. The mom's anger might be more about her feelings of being unappreciated or her desire for the user to fully accept the stepfather. The user's right to set boundaries in their relationship with the stepfather is valid. They don't owe him a title if they don't feel it's appropriate. The stepfather's lack of effort to connect could justify the user's stance.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the user isn't wrong. They have the right to define their relationship on their terms. The mom's reaction might be harsh, but the user's position is justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
