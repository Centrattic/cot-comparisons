  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that their parents got divorced, mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't great. The user says the stepdad hasn't tried to get to know them, they argue a lot, and there's tension. The user's mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" leading the user to say he's not their dad. Mom got angry, called them ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is not required to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel comfortable. Family relationships can be complex, especially after a divorce and remarriage. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to bond, and the user's interactions with him are strained. The user's response was factual, not angry, but the mom took it as ungratefulness. \n\nIs the user wrong? Well, forcing someone to use a title that doesn't feel right can be hurtful. The user's right to set boundaries in their relationship with the stepdad. The mom might be projecting her own expectations or wanting the user to accept the stepdad as a parent figure, but the user's feelings are valid. The stepdad's lack of effort and the couple's arguments don't help either. \n\nThe user didn't lash out; they stated a fact. The mother's reaction seems harsh. It's possible the mom is prioritizing her own needs over the user's feelings. So, the user isn't in the wrong. They have the right to how they refer to their stepfather. Therefore, answer B.\n"
