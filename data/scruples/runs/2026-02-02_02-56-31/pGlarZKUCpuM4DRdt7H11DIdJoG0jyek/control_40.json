  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents divorced, the mom remarried two years ago. The stepfather isn't great\u2014doesn't try to get to know the kid, they argue a lot, and the kid has had arguments with him. The mom calls him \"your father,\" and the kid says he's not their dad, which made the mom angry, calling the kid ungrateful and not accepting him.\n\nSo, is the kid in the wrong? Well, family dynamics can be complicated. The stepfather isn't the biological father, so the child not feeling a familial bond isn't unreasonable. The stepfather's behavior (arguing, not trying to connect) probably contributed to the child's reluctance. The mom's reaction seems harsh. She might want the child to accept the stepfather, but forcing a title when there's no genuine relationship might be too much. The child's statement was factual and not angry. The mom's anger and cutting off communication could be overreacting. On the other hand, maybe the mom wants unity in the new family. But the stepfather's own issues (like arguing with the mom) might make the child's stance valid. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong)."
