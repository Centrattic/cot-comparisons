  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" So, the situation is their parents got divorced, their mom remarried, and now they're living with her and her new husband. The stepdad isn't really close with the kid, they argue a lot, and the mom and stepdad also argue. The mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" and the user said he's not their dad. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider family dynamics. The user is 14 or 15 maybe? Or maybe a bit older. Not specified, but teens often go through identity issues. The user's mom wants them to accept the stepdad, but the user isn't comfortable with that. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to connect, and their interactions are strained. \n\nThe mom's reaction seems harsh. She's upset because the user isn't calling him \"father,\" which she might see as a lack of acceptance or respect. But if the stepdad isn't acting like a father figure, is the user obligated to call him that? It's about respect versus reality. The user isn't being disrespectful, just stating a fact based on their relationship. \n\nThe mom might be projecting her desires onto the situation. She wants the family to be whole again, but if the stepdad isn't fulfilling that role, the user's resistance is valid. The user isn't in the wrong for not accepting a title that doesn't fit their relationship. The mom's anger is misplaced because the user is being honest about their feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the user isn't in the wrong). They have valid reasons for not calling the stepdad \"Dad,\" especially if there's no real father-son relationship. The mom needs to respect the user's feelings and work on building that connection rather than forcing the title.\n"
