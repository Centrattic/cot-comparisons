  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a divorce and remarriage. The key points here are the user's feelings towards their stepfather and the mother's reaction.\n\nFirst, the user lives with their mom and her new husband. The stepfather isn't close with the user; they argue a lot and don't get along. The mom refers to him as \"your father,\" which the user objects to. The user says \"he's not my dad,\" which leads to the mom being angry and calling them ungrateful. The user is now wondering if they're wrong for not accepting the title.\n\nI need to consider family dynamics and emotional aspects. Legally, since the stepfather isn't a biological parent, he isn't the user's father. Emotionally, the user has had a strained relationship. The mother might feel that the user should respect the stepfather by using the title, but the user isn't comfortable. It's important to note that the user's resistance isn't out of spite but because of their actual relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about the user's feelings versus the mother's expectations. The user isn't obligated to use a title they're uncomfortable with. However, the mother's reaction might stem from wanting her new husband to be accepted. But the user isn't the asshole here because they have valid reasons for not calling the stepfather \"Dad.\" The mother's anger might be unwarranted, especially if the stepfather hasn't made an effort to connect. So, the answer is B.\n"
