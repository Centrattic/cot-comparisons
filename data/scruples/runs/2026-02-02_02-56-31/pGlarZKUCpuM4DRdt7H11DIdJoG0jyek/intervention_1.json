  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a complicated family dynamic after their parents' divorce and remarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They live with their mom, who is now remarried. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to bond, there are frequent arguments between him and the mom, and when the user says he's not their dad, the mom gets angry, calling them ungrateful. The user is just stating a fact based on their experiences, not in anger. The mom's reaction seems harsh given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel hurt because she's trying to present a united front and wants her child to accept the new spouse. However, the user has valid reasons for their stance. The stepfather isn't acting in a way that would make someone feel like a father figure, and the user's response is a reaction to real issues. It's important to recognize that family dynamics vary, and forcing a title without mutual respect might be unrealistic.\n\nThe user isn't being disrespectful; they're expressing their genuine feelings. The mom's anger might stem from frustration with the situation as well. But the user isn't in the wrong for not calling someone \"Dad\" if that person hasn't earned the role. So, the answer leans towards B.\n"
