In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The parents are divorced, the mother remarried two years ago. The stepfather (stepdad) isn't close to the author, they argue a lot, and the stepdad hasn't made an effort to get to know the author. The mother recently referred to the stepdad as \"your father,\" which upset the author. They responded by saying, \"he's not my dad,\" which caused the mother to get angry and stop speaking to them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nNow, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's position is that the stepdad isn't their father because of the lack of relationship and the stepdad's behavior. The mother is upset because she wants the author to accept her new husband as the father figure. The key points here are about family dynamics, expectations, and the emotional impact on all parties involved.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, calling someone \"Dad\" implies a certain level of closeness and respect that hasn't been established. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to build that relationship, and their interactions have been strained. The author is asserting their right to not recognize someone as a father if that role isn't fulfilled. That seems reasonable because titles like \"Dad\" are often about the actual relationship, not just a legal or marital status.\n\nOn the mother's side, she might feel that the author is being disrespectful or ungrateful, especially since she's moved on with her life and expects her child to do the same. However, the mother's anger might also stem from her own desire to present a united front or her sensitivity about the remarriage. But the author's refusal isn't out of malice; it's based on the reality of their relationship. \n\nConsidering the stepdad's behavior\u2014arguing with the mother and not trying to connect with the author\u2014it's clear he hasn't acted like a father figure. The author's statement, \"he's not my dad,\" is a factual assessment based on their experiences. The mother's reaction being anger and cutting off communication seems excessive, especially if the author isn't in the wrong for stating their genuine feelings.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's common for step-parents to take on parental roles, it's not mandatory. The author isn't obligated to use a title that feels inauthentic. The mother's insistence might be projecting her own needs onto her child, expecting more acceptance than the situation warrants.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't being an asshole here. They're standing by their feelings in a situation where the stepdad hasn't earned the title. The mother's reaction, while hurtful, doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
