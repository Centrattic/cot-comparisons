  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Their parents are divorced, and their mom is remarried. The stepfather hasn't really tried to connect, they argue a lot, and the user feels uncomfortable with the dynamic. The mom called them ungrateful after the user said, \"he's not my dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They have a valid reason to feel that the stepfather isn't a father figure. The stepdad's behavior (not getting to know them, arguing with the mom) and the user's own negative interactions support their stance. It's natural to have boundaries, especially when the relationship isn't healthy.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel hurt because she's trying to integrate the stepfather into their lives. She might see the user's refusal as resistance to the new family structure. However, the user isn't wrong to express their feelings honestly. Forcing someone to call someone else \"Dad\" can be disrespectful if there's no genuine relationship. The mom's reaction seems harsh, especially since the user didn't say it angrily but matter-of-factly.\n\nLegally and socially, titles like \"Dad\" are subjective. The user has the right to choose how they refer to people, especially if the relationship isn't positive. The stepfather isn't a biological parent, so the expectation to call him \"Dad\" is not absolute. The mom's anger might stem from her own expectations not being met, but that doesn't justify her being upset with the user for being honest.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not calling the stepfather \"Dad,\" and the mom's reaction seems unfair. The key points are the stepfather's lack of effort, the negative interactions, and the user's right to set boundaries. So, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
