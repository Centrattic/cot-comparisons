In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" Their parents are divorced, and their mom remarried. The stepdad hasn't really tried to connect with them, and there's a lot of arguing between them and the mom. When the mom referred to the stepdad as \"your father,\" the user said he's not their dad, which made the mom angry.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is living with their mom and stepdad. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to get to know them, and their interactions have been strained. The user's mom is now pushing for the user to call him \"Dad,\" which the user is uncomfortable with.\n\nI think the user has a valid reason not to call him \"Dad\" given the lack of a meaningful relationship and the negative interactions. The mom's reaction might be from a place of wanting the user to accept her new husband, but it's important to respect the user's feelings. Insisting that someone call another \"Dad\" when they don't feel that connection could be seen as dismissive of the user's genuine emotions. The stepdad's behavior also plays a role here\u2014since he hasn't tried to build a relationship, the user isn't obligated to take on that title. The mom's anger over being called \"ungrateful\" might not be justified if she hasn't addressed the stepdad's behavior or supported the user's need for a better relationship. So, the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
