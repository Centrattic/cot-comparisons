In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the author's parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't great. The author and stepdad don't get along, there are arguments between them, and the stepdad hasn't tried to get to know the author. The mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" and the author responded that he's not their dad, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's feelings about the stepfather are important. If the stepfather isn't acting like a father and hasn't made an effort, the author's reluctance to use the term \"Dad\" might be understandable. On the other hand, the mom is trying to integrate the stepfather into their family, and she's upset that the author isn't accepting him. \n\nBut the key points are: the stepfather's behavior (not trying to connect, arguments), the author's genuine feelings, and the mom's reaction. The author's response was factual and not angry, but the mom took it as ungrateful. \n\nLegally or socially, there's no requirement to call someone \"Dad.\" The term is more about relationship and respect. If the stepfather hasn't earned that title through actions, the author isn't wrong for not using it. The mom's expectation might be based on her desire for the family unit to be cohesive, but forcing a title without the underlying relationship can be unrealistic. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
