In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The key points here are the dynamics between the family members after the divorce and remarriage.\n\nFirst, the stepfather isn't getting along well with the author. They mention that the stepdad never tried to get to know them, they argue a lot, and he's not nice. The mom refers to him as \"your father,\" which makes the author uncomfortable, leading to a conflict. The mother got angry, called the author ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not calling the stepfather \"Dad.\" From what I know, family titles can be a sensitive topic. The author's feelings are valid if there's a lack of a positive relationship. The mother might expect the title for reasons of integration or respect, but if the stepfather isn't fulfilling the role of a father, the author has a right to feel that the title isn't appropriate. The mother's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nThe stepfather's behavior (not trying to connect, arguments, being unkind) suggests he hasn't earned the title in the author's eyes. The author's response was factual, not hostile. The mother's reaction could be harsh, but the core issue is about mutual respect and the actual relationship dynamics. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
