In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't very nice or involved. The user doesn't want to call him Dad, and their mom got upset when they said he's not their dad.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user lives with their mom, who's remarried. The stepdad isn't making an effort to get to know them and they argue a lot. The user's reaction was factual, not angry, but the mom took it as ungrateful. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong here. They have valid reasons for not wanting to call the stepdad Dad. If the stepdad isn't fulfilling a fatherly role, the resistance makes sense. The mom's reaction seems harsh because she might expect the user to accept the relationship despite the stepdad's shortcomings. However, the user isn't obligated to use a title that doesn't feel right, especially if the relationship isn't there. \n\nThe key points are the lack of effort from the stepdad and the user's justified discomfort. The mom's anger might stem from her desire for the family to present unity, but the user's feelings are valid. So the answer should be B, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
