In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and they don't really get along with the stepdad. The mother got angry when the user said he's not their dad, even though it was a matter-of-fact statement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional context. The user might feel that since the stepfather is not their biological father and the relationship is strained, using the term \"Dad\" is inappropriate. On the other hand, the mother might expect the user to use the term as a sign of respect and integration into the new family dynamic.\n\nBut the stepfather hasn't made an effort to connect, and there's a lot of arguing. The user's response was factual and not aggressive, so maybe it's reasonable for them to not use the term. However, family dynamics can be complex. The mother might feel hurt because she's trying to merge the family, and the user's refusal could be seen as rejecting her new spouse, which might affect their relationship with the mother.\n\nI should also think about cultural norms. In some cultures, addressing step-parents by their title is expected, while others are more flexible. The user's stance might be justified if the stepfather isn't fulfilling a parental role or if the user hasn't chosen to adopt the relationship. The key points are the lack of effort from the stepfather and the user's discomfort. So, no, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The mother's reaction seems harsh given the circumstances. The answer is B.\n"
