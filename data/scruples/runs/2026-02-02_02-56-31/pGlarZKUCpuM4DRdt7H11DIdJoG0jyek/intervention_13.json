In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user's parents divorced, their mom remarried two years ago. The stepfather isn't close with the user, they argue a lot, and the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" which the user objects to. The mom got upset and hasn't spoken to the user since.\n\nThe user says the stepdad isn't trying to get to know them and they have arguments. The mom is pushing for the user to accept him as \"father,\" but the user feels they don't want to because of the negative interactions. The user's response was factual but made the mom angry. Now, the user is wondering if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nI need to decide if the user is wrong. The key points here are about family dynamics, personal boundaries, and expectations. The user isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel connected. The mom pushing for it might be trying to create a family bond, but if the stepfather isn't making an effort, the user's resistance is understandable. The mom's reaction could be harsh, expecting acceptance without mutual effort from the stepdad. The user isn't in the wrong for stating their feelings honestly. So, the answer should be B.\n"
