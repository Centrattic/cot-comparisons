In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" They live with their mom and stepdad, but their parents are divorced. The stepdad didn't try to get to know them, they argue a lot, and the user doesn't feel comfortable calling him Dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They have reasons not to call him \"Dad\"\u2014their stepfather isn't close to them, there are arguments, and the user feels it's not right. The mom called them ungrateful for not accepting the stepdad. But is the user in the wrong?\n\nThe stepdad hasn't built a relationship with them. The user's mom might want them to call him \"Dad\" to show acceptance, but if the stepdad hasn't earned that title through actions, maybe the user isn't wrong. The user's feelings are valid. The mom's anger might stem from her own expectations, but the user isn't obligated to use a title if they don't feel it's appropriate. So, probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
