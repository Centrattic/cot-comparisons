In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't great\u2014doesn't connect with them, argues with the mom, and they've had arguments. When the mom referred to the stepdad as \"your father,\" the user said, \"he's not my dad,\" which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's mom wants them to call the stepdad by a term that implies a father-son/daughter relationship. The user feels that the stepdad hasn't earned that title due to the negative interactions and lack of connection. The mom is upset, calling the user ungrateful and not accepting, leading to a rift.\n\nLegally, step-parents don't automatically become legal parents unless they adopt, but that's not the main issue here. Emotionally, the user might feel that the title \"Dad\" is reserved for their biological father. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to build a relationship, so the user's resistance is understandable. The mom's reaction might be because she wants the family to be cohesive, but if the stepdad isn't engaging positively, the user's pushback is justified.\n\nThe key points are consent and effort. Did the stepdad try to connect? The user says he hasn't. The user's response was factual, not hostile. The mom's anger stems from the user not complying with her wish for him to be seen as a father figure, but if the stepdad hasn't earned that role, the user isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
