In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The story is that the parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't great. He doesn't get along with the kid, they argue, and the mom calls him \"your father,\" which the kid objects to. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to the kid since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kid is living with the mom and stepdad, but their relationship is strained. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to bond, and they have arguments. The mom is pushing the kid to accept the stepdad as a father figure, but the kid resists. The key issue is whether the kid is wrong for not wanting to call him \"Dad.\"\n\nFrom the kid's perspective, they might feel that the stepdad isn't fulfilling a fatherly role. The stepdad hasn't tried to get close, there's conflict, and the kid doesn't see him as a father. It's natural for the kid to resist a title that doesn't feel earned. The mom, on the other hand, might feel that the kid is ungrateful, especially if she wants the stepdad to be a part of their lives.\n\nBut is the kid wrong? Well, the stepdad isn't their biological father, and if the relationship is adversarial, the kid has a right to not use the title \"Dad\" if it's uncomfortable. The mom might be trying to enforce a familial role that the kid isn't ready to accept. The kid's response was factual and not angry, so it's a matter of opinion. Some might say the kid should make an effort for the mom's sake, but others would agree that the kid isn't obligated to use a title they don't feel is appropriate.\n\nThe stepdad's behavior is a factor too. If he hasn't made an effort to build a relationship, the kid isn't wrong to not recognize him as a father. The mom's anger might stem from frustration that the kid isn't accepting her new husband as part of their family, but the kid's feelings are valid given the circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not calling the stepdad \"Dad,\" especially considering the strained relationship and lack of effort from the stepdad.\n"
