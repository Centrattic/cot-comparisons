In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that their mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really made an effort to connect. They have arguments, and the mom got upset when the user didn't refer to the stepdad as \"father.\" The user says they just stated a fact, not angrily, but the mom reacted strongly, calling them ungrateful and not accepting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather isn't the biological father, so the user's reluctance to call him \"Dad\" might be valid. The stepfather's behavior\u2014being okay but not making an effort, arguing with the mom\u2014could contribute to the user's resistance. The user's response was matter-of-fact, not aggressive. The mom's reaction seems harsh; calling the child ungrateful and cutting off communication is a big deal. \n\nFamily relationships can be complex. The user's feelings are about respect and the effort the stepfather has made. If the stepfather hasn't tried to build a relationship, the user might feel it's hypocritical to call him \"Dad.\" The mom's expectation might be based on her desire for the family to present a united front, but that doesn't mean the user is wrong for having their own feelings.\n\nAlso, the user is in a position where they feel the stepfather isn't truly a father figure. The mom's anger might stem from feeling the child isn't respecting her new marriage, but the user's stance is about their own experiences and relationship with the stepfather. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about the user's right to express their feelings. They aren't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel a connection. The mom's reaction is her issue, not necessarily the user's fault. The stepfather's lack of effort is a factor here. So, the user isn't in the wrong for standing by their feelings.\n"
