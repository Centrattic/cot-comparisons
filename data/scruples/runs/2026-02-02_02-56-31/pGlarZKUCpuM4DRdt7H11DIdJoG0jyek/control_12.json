In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation revolves around family dynamics after the parents' divorce and remarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They live with their mom, who is now remarried. The stepfather isn't close to them, there's been conflict, and the author doesn't feel a bond. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author reacts by saying he's not their dad. The mom gets angry, saying they're ungrateful and haven't accepted him.\n\nNow, looking at the stepfather's role: he's not the biological father, hasn't tried to connect, and there are ongoing arguments between the mom and stepdad. The author's reaction is a matter of fact, not anger. The mom's anger comes from feeling rejected, perhaps because she wants the stepfather to be accepted in a parental role.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The stepfather isn't the biological parent, so the author might not feel comfortable using a title that implies a closer relationship. However, the mom's feelings are hurt because she might expect the author to at least respect her new spouse. But if the stepfather isn't fulfilling the role of a father, is it wrong for the author to not call him that?\n\nAlso, the mom's remarriage happened two years ago, and the author didn't have a strong relationship to begin with. The author's reaction seems to be about not wanting to be part of a family dynamic that isn't working. The mom's anger might stem from feeling that her new marriage is being undermined.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid reason not to call someone \"Dad\" if that person hasn't earned that title through a positive relationship. The mom's expectations might be unrealistic if the stepfather hasn't engaged with the child. The author isn't being disrespectful by stating a fact but rather expressing their genuine feelings. The mom's reaction is more about her own feelings of rejection than the author's actions being objectively wrong.\n"
