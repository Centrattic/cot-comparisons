My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation they described.\n\nFirst, the author is a father with two kids, living with his girlfriend. There was a previous issue where he asked the girlfriend to take care of the kids a few days a week after she lost her job, and she was upset about that. Now, he decided to talk to his oldest son (14 years old) about how he feels about the living arrangement, the ex-wife, and the girlfriend. The author did this because he was concerned about the kids' well-being, inspired by comments from Reddit that suggested the kids might be picking up on tension. \n\nAfter talking to his son, the girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house and is reconsidering the relationship. The author is questioning if he did something wrong by having that conversation with his son without discussing it with her first.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father's intent was to check on his child's emotional state, which is a parental responsibility. However, the way he approached it may have been a communication issue. The girlfriend felt that by discussing her with the son without her consent, he didn't trust her. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids without needing her permission, and the conversation wasn't just about her but also about the mother's absence.\n\nFrom a typical perspective, parents should be able to discuss their children's well-being with them. However, involving a partner in such discussions, especially a co-parent, might require some level of communication. But in this case, the author wasn't consulting the girlfriend about the children's daily care but rather checking in on their emotional state. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, possibly because she felt disrespected or that her role in the family was being questioned. However, the father's action was to ensure his son's well-being, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe question is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with the son. Since it's a 14-year-old, the son can have such conversations, and the father is fulfilling his role as a parent. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her position in the family is under scrutiny. But the father isn't in the wrong for wanting to ensure his child is okay. The main issue is the lack of communication between the couple about the father's intent. However, the father isn't wrong for talking to his child; he's wrong only if he should have discussed it with the girlfriend first. But as a parent, he has the right to discuss family matters with his children. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
