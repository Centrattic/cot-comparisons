My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a father living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got angry and called him an asshole. Then, after some feedback from Reddit, the author decided to talk to his oldest son about how he perceives the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was upset, feeling undermined, leading her to leave the house and question the relationship. The author is now asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. As a parent, the author's responsibility is to the well-being of his children. He's trying to ensure that his children are okay with the living situation, especially since his ex-wife isn't around and the new girlfriend is now a part of their lives. The author is concerned about how his kids perceive the girlfriend, which seems like a valid concern. Parents often check in with their kids to see how they're adjusting to new family dynamics.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She feels that talking to the son about her undermines her and shows a lack of confidence in her. That's a big deal because it affects their relationship. The key point here is whether the parent had the right to talk to his son about the girlfriend without the girlfriend's consent. \n\nOn one hand, the parent has a right to discuss family matters with his children. It's part of parenting. The conversation was also about the mother being away, so it's part of a larger discussion about the family situation. The parent might not have intended to undermine the girlfriend, but the way it came across was hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her role in the family is being questioned or evaluated without her input. In a relationship, especially with someone who is a step-parent figure, there's often a desire for validation and respect. If the parent discusses the girlfriend's role with the child without considering her feelings, it could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of support. \n\nBut the parent's main goal here is to ensure the child's well-being and to understand if the child is comfortable with the new family structure. That's a responsible action. However, maybe the parent should have been more careful in how he approached the conversation. Perhaps he could have included the girlfriend in the conversation or assured her that the goal was to support the children, not to criticize her.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but her feelings are valid. If a partner feels that you're discussing them in a way that could be critical, especially with their stepchildren, it can lead to insecurity. The parent might need to have a conversation with the girlfriend to explain his intentions and reassure her that it's about the kids' well-being, not a lack of confidence in her.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He's acting in the children's best interest, which is a parent's duty. However, he didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings in this situation. While it's not his fault that the conversation caused issues, he might have a responsibility to communicate better with his partner about such discussions. The line between parenting and respecting a partner's feelings can be thin here.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's fulfilling his parental role. But he could have handled the situation more sensitively. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also valid because feeling undermined is a real issue. But since the primary duty is to the children, the author's action was necessary. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I didn't miss anything. The key is whether talking to the child about the girlfriend was necessary and appropriate. Since it's part of checking on the child's well-being, it's justified. So, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
