My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 44-year-old man with two sons, ages 8 and 14. He's in a relationship with a girlfriend who recently lost her job, and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict. The previous post indicated that people were concerned about the kids sensing the girlfriend's reluctance. The author then decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about how he feels regarding the girlfriend and the situation with his mother. The girlfriend found out and was upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house to stay with a friend and is reconsidering the relationship.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether talking to his son about the girlfriend was wrong. The author argues that he needed to talk to his children without needing permission from the girlfriend. The girlfriend felt that this conversation was a betrayal and a lack of confidence in her.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a legitimate concern about his children's well-being, especially since previous feedback suggested the kids might be picking up on the tension. Talking to them to assess their feelings makes sense as a parent. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in that context without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her, especially in a co-parenting situation if the ex-mother is involved. But the author mentions that the conversation was also about his ex's trip, not just the girlfriend.\n\nBut then, the key point is whether the author had the right to talk to his son about the girlfriend. As a parent, he should have the right to discuss family matters with his children, including their perceptions of the people in their lives. The girlfriend might feel hurt, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. However, the way the conversation was approached could matter. If he was critical of the girlfriend or made the son choose sides, that could be problematic. The author says he didn't do that, but the girlfriend's reaction is strong.\n\nAlso, considering past behavior where the girlfriend was reluctant to take on responsibilities, maybe the author was checking in on the kids to ensure they weren't being negatively affected. But the girlfriend's reaction could be due to feeling not trusted or respected. The question is whether the author overstepped by discussing the girlfriend's role in front of the child without consulting her first.\n\nIn family dynamics, open communication is important. If the author didn't consult his girlfriend before talking to the son about her, that might be seen as a breach of trust. However, as a parent, he might also have a responsibility to his children's emotional well-being. The balance here is tricky. If the conversation was purely about the child's feelings and not to criticize the girlfriend, it might be justified. But if it came across as a critique or undermining, then it's more of an issue.\n\nThe author states he didn't go into the conversation to undermine her and that it was about his ex's trip too. So maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. On the other hand, if the son was discussing his perceptions of the girlfriend, that could make the girlfriend feel like the conversation was a setup or that the father is not supportive of her. The girlfriend's reaction might be an overreaction, but the author could have handled it more sensitively, perhaps by discussing his concerns with his ex-wife or a mediator first. However, as a parent, he's entitled to talk to his children about their feelings without involving his girlfriend unless there's a co-parenting agreement in place. But since the girlfriend is not the mother, maybe it's different. Wait, the original post says the kids' mother is away, so the girlfriend is the stepmother. The author might be in a blended family situation, which adds complexity.\n\nIn blended families, step-parents often feel the need to build a relationship with their spouse's children. If the author is the father, he has a responsibility to his children's well-being, but the stepmother might feel that discussing her role without her input could be hurtful. The author's action could be seen as necessary for his children's emotional health, but it's possible he should have communicated his intentions to his girlfriend first to avoid misunderstandings. However, he might not be obligated to clear every conversation with her about the kids' feelings.\n\nThe key factors are: the parent's responsibility to the children, the girlfriend's feelings about being discussed without her knowledge, and whether the conversation was in good faith. The author's intent seems to be checking in on his children's perceptions, which is a valid parental concern. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but that doesn't automatically make the author wrong. It's more about whether the method was appropriate. Since he didn't have prior communication with the girlfriend and she felt betrayed, there's a conflict here between parental duty and partner trust.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a valid reason to talk to his son, the girlfriend's feelings of being undermined are real, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for acting in his children's best interest. The answer might depend on the cultural context and family norms. However, the author isn't in the wrong if the conversation was conducted in a respectful and necessary way, even if it upset the girlfriend. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
