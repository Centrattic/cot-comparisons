My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and she's been upset because he discussed this with his oldest son.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a conversation with his son about the girlfriend, which the girlfriend found offensive. She felt undermined and it led to her leaving. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being, especially since she had recently lost her job and he was supporting her. The previous Reddit post mentioned that people were concerned the kids could sense her not wanting to be there.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's a parent trying to ensure his children's well-being. It's a valid concern for a parent to check in with their kids about how they're adjusting, especially when there are significant changes like a new living situation or a parent's job loss. The author didn't go to the kids to undermine the girlfriend; he mentions the conversation was also about the mother being away. That suggests his intentions were to understand the kids' feelings in a broader context, not just about the girlfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She felt betrayed and questioned his maturity. The author is an adult, and the girlfriend is also an adult. The question is whether talking to his son about her was an overstep. But parents often discuss their partners' behavior with their children to some extent, especially if they're concerned. However, there's a line where it could be seen as manipulative or undermining. The key here is the intent and how the conversation was conducted.\n\nThe author didn't mention that he criticized the girlfriend to the child. Instead, he says it was a discussion about how the child perceives her and his mother. If it was a neutral, open conversation, then it's part of parenting. However, if the author framed it in a way that made the child feel the girlfriend was being criticized, that could be problematic. The author claims he didn't go in to undermine her, so unless there's evidence he was badmouthing her, it's more about understanding the child's perspective.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend feeling that her relationship with the kids is the author's business. But as the kids' father, he has a right to be involved in their well-being. The girlfriend might feel it's her role to parent, but the father's involvement isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way he approached it might have been a miscommunication. If the author didn't consult his girlfriend beforehand, that could be an issue, but the situation is that he didn't realize the impact until others pointed it out. Now he's taking proactive steps, which is good parenting.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. If she's the one living with the kids and responsible for their care, she might feel that her relationship with them is private. But the parent has a duty to ensure the children's needs are met, which includes understanding their feelings and adjusting as necessary. The author isn't doing anything inherently wrong by seeking that information.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were in the best interest of his children's well-being, and unless he was actively trying to undermine the girlfriend, which he denies, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her feeling undermined than the action itself. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
