My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a man living with his girlfriend and his two sons. He asked the girlfriend to pick up the kids from school a few days a week after she lost her job, and she got angry and called him an asshole. Now, he's talking to his oldest son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The son seems okay with it, but the girlfriend found out and is upset, thinking he's undermining her. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe user is asking if he's the asshole. The main question is whether talking to his son about his girlfriend without her consent is wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is a parent and has a responsibility to check in on his children's well-being, especially regarding their caregivers. The girlfriend is acting as a temporary caretaker. However, the way he approached the conversation might be an issue. If he discussed her in a critical or undermining way, that could be problematic. But from the post, he mentions that the conversation was about both his ex-wife and the girlfriend, and the son had valid thoughts but was happy. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected or not trusted. In relationships, especially with children involved, communication is key. Even though the user is a parent, approaching such discussions without considering the girlfriend's feelings could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend might feel that her role and their relationship dynamics are being judged or discussed without her input. \n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to talk to their children about their lives and caregivers to ensure the kids are comfortable. The problem might be in the method or the lack of prior discussion with the girlfriend about how to handle such conversations. It's possible the user didn't frame the talk properly, leading the girlfriend to feel undermined. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the user's intent and the manner of the conversation were respectful and aimed at the child's well-being, or if it was critical of the girlfriend. The post doesn't provide details on how the conversation was conducted, but the girlfriend's reaction indicates she felt hurt. Therefore, there's a part where the user might have failed to communicate his intentions to the girlfriend, leading to misunderstanding. \n\nIn such cases, transparency is important. The user could be in the wrong if he didn't consider the potential impact on the girlfriend and didn't discuss with her first. However, if the conversation was purely about the child's feelings without any negative context, then maybe not. The girlfriend's overreaction might be the issue, but as adults, both should handle such situations maturely. \n\nSo, considering the girlfriend's perspective and the need for mutual communication, the user might have been wrong in not discussing the conversation with her first. Answer A.\n"
