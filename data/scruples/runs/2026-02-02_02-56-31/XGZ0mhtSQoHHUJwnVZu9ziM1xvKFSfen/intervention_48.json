My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the dad is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he talked to his oldest son about how the kid feels about his girlfriend and the situation with his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, thinking he undermined her and didn't have confidence in her. The dad's reasoning is that he needed to talk to his kids about important stuff without needing to clear it with his girlfriend first.\n\nHmm, first, from the dad's perspective, it makes sense. As a parent, he has a responsibility to check in with his kids about their feelings, especially when there are changes in family dynamics like a new partner and a parent not being around. The kids' well-being is a priority. But the girlfriend's reaction is also intense. She might feel that he's not supporting her or that he's questioning her ability to be a good stepmother by discussing her with the kids without her knowledge.\n\nBut the key here is whether the dad overstepped. He mentions that the conversation was also about his ex-wife's trip, not just the girlfriend. He wanted to make sure the kids were okay with the arrangement. The girlfriend feeling undermined is a big deal. Even if the dad's intentions were good, approaching the conversation without considering how it might affect his partner's feelings could be a misstep. \n\nHowever, the dad has a right to communicate with his children about their lives and relationships. The problem might be the lack of communication between the dad and his girlfriend about the conversation. If he had discussed it with her first, maybe they could have found a way to address any concerns without her feeling attacked. But does he need to clear every conversation with his kids with his partner? Probably not, especially since the kids are his responsibility as their parent. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems a bit over the top, but her feelings are valid. It's a delicate balance. The dad's intention was to ensure his child's well-being, which is his role. The girlfriend might need to adjust to the fact that he will prioritize his kids' needs, even if the way he went about it upset her. \n\nSo, where's the line? If the dad didn't use the conversation to criticize the girlfriend but just to understand the kids' perspectives, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the girlfriend felt that the conversation was a setup or that he didn't trust her, that's a communication issue between them. The dad might need to better communicate with his partner about his parenting decisions, but he's not necessarily in the wrong for talking to his own kids.\n"
