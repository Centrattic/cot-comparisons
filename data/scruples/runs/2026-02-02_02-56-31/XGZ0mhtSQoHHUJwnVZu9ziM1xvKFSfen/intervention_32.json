My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the guy is asking if he's in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is staying with them, she lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids sometimes, which led to conflict. Then he talked to his son about his feelings towards the girlfriend and his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication between parents and children in a blended family. The user's argument is that he needed to talk to his son about his well-being, which includes his perception of the girlfriend. He mentions that the conversation was also about the mother being away, not just the girlfriend. The girlfriend, however, feels that discussing her with the son without her consent is a breach of trust and undermines her.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, parents do have a responsibility to check in with their kids, especially when there are changes in family dynamics. The user's intention was to ensure his son was okay, which is a valid parental concern. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in that context could affect the son's perception or create tension. But since the user is the parent, he has the right to talk to his children about their feelings regarding the people in their lives, including a new partner. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme if the conversation was meant to be supportive and not critical. However, maybe the way he approached it could have been more sensitive. Did he frame the conversation in a way that was non-judgmental? Or did he imply that the girlfriend was problematic? The user says he didn't mean to undermine her, but the girlfriend felt betrayed. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, communication is key. The user might have failed to consider how the girlfriend would react, even though his intentions were good. But the girlfriend's reaction of leaving and saying the relationship needs rethinking might be over the top. The user's action itself isn't inherently wrong because he's a parent, but maybe the approach could have been better discussed with the girlfriend first. However, the question is whether he's the asshole, not whether there's room for improvement. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, he's not in the wrong) because as a parent, he has the right and responsibility to talk to his children about their feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her insecurities or miscommunication. Unless he was negative about the girlfriend, which he didn't mention, he's not at fault.\n"
