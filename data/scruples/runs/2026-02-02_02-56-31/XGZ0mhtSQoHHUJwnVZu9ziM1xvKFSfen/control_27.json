My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author thinks he's not wrong because he needed to talk to his kids without her permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man has two sons, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old. He previously had an issue where his girlfriend didn't want to take care of the kids, leading her to call him an asshole. Then, after some feedback from the Reddit comments, he decided to talk to his oldest son about how he feels about the girlfriend and the situation with his mom. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, leaving the house and saying she needs to rethink the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father's intention was to check in with his son about his feelings, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the girlfriend felt that this conversation was a criticism of her. The father didn't inform her beforehand, which might have been a miscommunication. But as parents, they do need to talk to their children about various aspects of their lives, including relationships with other adults in the household.\n\nBut is the father in the wrong here? Well, from a parental perspective, it's important to know how the children feel about their living situation and caregivers. The father's actions were to ensure the well-being of his son. However, maybe he should have approached the conversation more carefully, perhaps discussing it with the girlfriend first if it was about her. But in some cases, especially if the child's well-being is a concern, parents might need to talk to their kids without prior approval from their partner.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. If the father was genuinely checking in with the child's feelings, not criticizing the girlfriend, then maybe she's overreacting. However, if the conversation was framed in a way that made the girlfriend feel criticized, that could be an issue. The father says the conversation was as much about his ex-wife's trip as about the girlfriend, so maybe it wasn't a direct attack.\n\nBut in a co-parenting situation, especially with a partner who's not the biological parent, there might be sensitivity about how the children perceive them. The father's action might have made the girlfriend feel insecure, even if the intention was good. However, the father isn't wrong for wanting to talk to his son. It's a normal parental duty. The problem might be the way the conversation was conducted or the lack of communication with the girlfriend beforehand.\n\nSo, considering all that, the father's intention was to check on his son's well-being, which is right. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh, but maybe the father could have handled it differently. But does that make him the asshole? Probably not. The answer is B (No), because he's not wrong for talking to his son about his feelings. However, maybe he should have considered her feelings more, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the action was for the child's sake, he's not in the wrong.\n"
