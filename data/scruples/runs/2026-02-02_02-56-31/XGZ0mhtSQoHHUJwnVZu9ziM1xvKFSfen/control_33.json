My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author is a 44-year-old man living with his girlfriend and two sons. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got really upset and called him an asshole. Then, in the current situation, he talked to his oldest son (14 years old) about how the son perceives his mom (the author's ex?), the girlfriend, and the living arrangement. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, feeling undermined and that he lacks confidence in her. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author argues that talking to his son is necessary to ensure the kids are okay, especially since previous comments suggested the kids might be picking up on tension. He didn't want to undermine the girlfriend and the conversation was also about the mother being away. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The father's responsibility to his children's well-being, 2) The girlfriend's reaction to being discussed without her knowledge, 3) The context of why he had the conversation with his son.\n\nFirst, from a parental responsibility standpoint, talking to his children about their family dynamics, including the step-parent or co-parent, is generally considered important. Parents need to know how their kids feel about their living situation and relationships to ensure their emotional health. The author had concerns based on previous feedback, so initiating the conversation to address those concerns makes sense. He's acting in the best interest of his children.\n\nHowever, the way the conversation was conducted might be a point of contention. If the girlfriend felt blindsided or that her feelings weren't considered, that could be a valid concern. In a co-parenting or step-parent situation, communication between the parents is crucial. The author didn't consult with his girlfriend before talking to the child about her. Even if the intent was good, the girlfriend might feel disrespected or undermined. \n\nBut then again, parents should have the right to talk to their children without needing permission from a new partner. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving the house and calling the author a child. However, the author's actions might have crossed a line if the conversation was critical of the girlfriend or made the child feel like they had to choose sides. The post mentions that the conversation was \"just as much about his mother's trip as it was about her,\" so maybe it was balanced. \n\nAnother angle: in a relationship, especially when there are children involved, transparency is important. The author didn't inform the girlfriend about his intentions, which could have led to her feeling excluded or mistrusted. If the conversation was intended to assess the kids' feelings about the girlfriend, maybe discussing it with her first to address any potential issues would have been better. However, the father's primary duty is to his children, so the necessity of the conversation is valid.\n\nIn terms of maturity, the girlfriend's reaction is quite intense. Leaving the house and threatening to rethink the relationship over a conversation with a child might be an overreaction. The author is trying to address concerns about the children's well-being, which is a parent's role. On the other hand, the author's approach could have been more collaborative with the girlfriend to avoid her feeling attacked.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: The author's actions were driven by a parental responsibility to check on his child's well-being, which is generally not wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but her feelings might be valid if the conversation was perceived as undermining her. However, the author's intent was not to undermine but to ensure his child's adjustment. It's a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's acting in his child's best interest. The girlfriend might need to work on communication and handling criticism, but the author isn't necessarily the asshole here.\n"
