My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person, a dad, talked to his oldest son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she feels undermined and that the dad doesn't have confidence in her. The dad's intention was to check in with his son, maybe ensure that the kids are okay with the living arrangement, especially since the girlfriend was supposed to be taking care of the kids after school. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's motives. He mentions that he hadn't had this conversation before and that others on Reddit had pointed out that the kids might sense if the girlfriend wasn't fully committed. He wanted to make sure the kids are okay. So his intention seems well-meaning, to check on his kids' well-being.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction is pretty intense\u2014she left the house and wants to rethink the relationship. She feels betrayed and that he doesn't trust her. Why would she feel that way? Maybe she felt that talking to the son about her was a way of questioning her ability to care for the kids. If the dad didn't discuss this with her first, she might perceive it as not respecting her authority or role in their home.\n\nIs there a right way to approach this? Maybe he should have had the conversation without focusing on the girlfriend so much, or perhaps he should have discussed his concerns with his girlfriend first? But then, as a parent, he should have the right to talk to his children about their feelings. However, if the context of the conversation was critical of the girlfriend or made the son feel like he needs to report on her, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the dad's actions. He didn't mention that he told the girlfriend beforehand. So maybe the dad didn't consider that discussing the girlfriend's role in front of the child (even though it was a private conversation) could make her feel like he's using the child as a go-between. In relationships, communication between partners is important. If the dad had concerns about how the girlfriend was handling the kids, maybe he should have addressed them directly with her instead of going to the child first. \n\nBut then again, the kid's well-being is a parent's priority. If the dad felt that the kids were being affected by the girlfriend's behavior or the situation, talking to them directly makes sense. However, the way he framed the conversation might have been the issue. If he asked the son about his girlfriend's behavior, that could come off as the dad not trusting her and putting the child in the middle.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend had just lost her job and was already under stress, which might have made her more sensitive. The dad's action could have been the last straw for her. Maybe she felt that he didn't support her during a tough time and was now doubting her ability to care for the kids. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, the key points are: Did the dad have the right to talk to his son about the girlfriend? Or did he overstep by not discussing it with her first? On one hand, parents should be able to talk to their kids about how they feel. On the other, the girlfriend might feel disrespected. \n\nI think the dad's intention was to check on his son's well-being, which is a valid concern. However, the method might have been problematic because it was done without considering the girlfriend's perspective. If the conversation was about the son's feelings towards his mother and the girlfriend, maybe the dad should have approached it more carefully, perhaps discussing with the girlfriend first to express his concerns about the kids' adjustment rather than going straight to the child. \n\nSo, whether he's in the wrong depends on how the conversation was conducted. If he was critical of the girlfriend or made the son feel like he needed to report on her, that's a problem. If it was just a general check-in, maybe not. But given the girlfriend's reaction, it's possible that the dad didn't realize the potential impact of involving the child in that way. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The dad might have failed to communicate his intentions to the girlfriend, leading to her feeling betrayed. So while his intention was to check on the kids, the approach could have been better. Therefore, he might share some responsibility here, but it's not entirely his fault. \n\nHmm, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the dad's action, while well-intentioned, didn't take into account the girlfriend's feelings and potentially put the child in the middle, it could be seen as a mistake. However, as a parent, he has a right to talk to his kids. It's a bit of a grey area. Given the girlfriend's strong reaction, maybe the dad should have handled it differently, so he's partially at fault. But the girlfriend's overreaction is also a factor. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't consider the girlfriend's perspective and didn't communicate his concerns to her first, which is a breach of trust in a relationship. Even if his intention was good, the method could have been better. So the answer might be A.\n"
