My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is a father living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and the author asked her to help with the kids a few days a week, which caused tension. Now, the author decided to talk to his oldest son (14 years old) about how he feels regarding the mother (who's away) and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author is now asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, the key points here are the parent's duty to their children versus the relationship with their partner. The parent is trying to ensure the kids are okay with the new living situation and the presence of the girlfriend. But the girlfriend perceives this conversation as a lack of trust or confidence in her. \n\nIn most parenting advice, it's common to say that parents should check in with their kids to make sure they're comfortable with new family dynamics. Especially when a parent is absent, the other guardian (in this case, the girlfriend) might be taking on more responsibilities, so the child's perception is important. However, the way this conversation happened might have triggered the girlfriend. The father didn't consult her before talking to the boy, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nBut then again, the father is also responsible for his children's well-being. He had a concern that others had pointed out about the kids sensing tension, so he wanted to address it. The conversation was about the children's feelings, not to critique the girlfriend but to ensure the kids are okay. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She feels undermined and betrayed, which suggests that there might be existing issues in their relationship. If the father had communicated with her beforehand, maybe he could have avoided this misunderstanding. But on the other hand, the father isn't obligated to clear every conversation with his partner about his children, especially if the kids are old enough to have their own opinions.\n\nSo, is the father wrong? If he did it in good faith to check on his son's well-being, then he's not the asshole. But maybe he should have considered how the girlfriend would feel, especially since she's the one living with the kids. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems over the top. The father isn't wrong for wanting to ensure his children are okay. The problem might be more about the girlfriend's insecurity rather than the father's actions. \n\nIn many similar situations, it's considered reasonable for parents to talk to their kids about their feelings about the people in their lives, even if it involves a partner. The father isn't criticizing the girlfriend directly; he's addressing his son's perspective. The girlfriend's reaction might be about her own insecurities or past experiences. \n\nTherefore, the father's actions are justified. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
