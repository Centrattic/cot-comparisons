My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether they did something wrong by talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the user is a father living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. Then he had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the current living situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and reacted negatively, feeling undermined and that he lacks confidence in her. She left the house to stay with a friend and is considering re-evaluating the relationship.\n\nThe user's main point is that he wanted to check in with his son to make sure he's okay with the changes, as people suggested in the previous Reddit post. He didn't mean to undermine the girlfriend. Now, he's being accused of betrayal and immaturity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' responsibility to their children. It's generally accepted that parents should communicate with their kids about family dynamics to ensure their well-being. Especially with a new partner involved, it's important for the kids to feel heard. So, having that conversation seems reasonable.\n\nBut then, the girlfriend's reaction is a big part of this. She felt that talking to the son about her was an attack or lack of trust. Maybe she felt he was gathering the son's opinion to validate her role or maybe she's sensitive about her position. The user argues that the conversation was about both the ex-wife (who was away) and the girlfriend, and that he's an adult who can talk to his kids without needing permission.\n\nThe key points here are: the father's duty to his children's emotional health versus the partner's feelings about being discussed. The father's action was to protect his kids, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the manner of the conversation could matter. Did he keep it neutral? Did he involve the son in a way that could be seen as a third party in a conflict?\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling insecure or not being trusted. But as an adult, she might also have expected that the father would discuss family matters with his children. The user mentions they're adults, so he shouldn't need to clear conversations with his kids. However, maybe there's a communication gap. If the father had discussed with the girlfriend first before talking to the son, maybe it could have been handled better. But the father's main concern was the kids' feelings, not criticizing the girlfriend.\n\nIn some cases, talking to children about a partner can be necessary to ensure they're adjusting well. However, if the partner feels that the conversation was done to undermine her, that could create tension. The father's intention was to check in, not to criticize. The girlfriend might have overreacted, but her feelings are valid if she feels disrespected.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the father in the wrong? If he had the right intention and the responsibility to talk to his son, then maybe not. However, the impact on the girlfriend is significant. Maybe the father could have handled it differently, like involving the girlfriend in the discussion first or finding a way to reassure her. But the act of talking to his son isn't inherently wrong. It's more about the context and communication between the adults.\n\nIn some relationships, discussing the partner with the children without prior discussion can be seen as not being inclusive. However, the father's actions were to address the children's well-being. It's a balance between the kids' needs and the partner's feelings. Since the father's intention was positive, and the kids were happy, he might not be wrong. But maybe he should have considered how to communicate this to his girlfriend better to avoid conflict. But the question is whether he's the asshole. If the girl is overreacting, then he's not in the wrong. If the conversation was necessary, then he's justified. Answer B.\n"
