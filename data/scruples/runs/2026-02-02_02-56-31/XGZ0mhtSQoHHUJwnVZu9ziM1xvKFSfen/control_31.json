My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author has two kids, 8 and 14 years old. He lives with his girlfriend and his kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict. Now, he's talking to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the situation, including his mother being away and his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and that the author doesn't trust her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father's intention to check in with his son about his well-being and his feelings towards the new family dynamics. The father mentions that the conversation was also about the mother's trip, not just the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is that he's undermining her and lacks confidence in her.\n\nNow, considering the father's role as a parent, he has a responsibility to ensure his children's emotional well-being. Talking to his son about their family situation seems like a reasonable step to do that. Parents often have conversations with their kids about various aspects of their lives, including step-parents or partners, especially when there are changes happening. The father didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to understand his feelings, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels betrayed. From her perspective, maybe she expected that discussions about her with the kids would be a shared decision. However, the father is not the one who introduced the girlfriend into the kids' lives; he's the parent, and it's part of his role to maintain a good relationship with his children. He's not obligated to consult her before talking to his son about family matters. That said, maybe a more collaborative approach could have helped, but the father's primary duty is to his children's emotional health.\n\nThe question is whether the father overstepped. Since he was concerned about the kids' adjustment and took steps to check in with the son, and there's no indication he criticized the girlfriend directly, his actions seem justified. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about feeling disrespected rather than the father acting in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He was acting in his children's best interest by understanding their feelings, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her insecurities or feeling untrusted, but the father's actions don't cross a line into wrongdoing.\n"
