My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong for talking to his son about his perception of the girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parent has two sons with an ex-wife. He's living with his current girlfriend, who recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict. Then, he talked to his oldest son (14 years old) about how the son feels regarding the girlfriend and his mother's absence. The girlfriend found out and felt undermined, leading her to leave the house and consider the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent did something wrong by discussing this with his son. Let's consider the key points. As a parent, it's standard practice to check in with children about their feelings, especially regarding their living situations and relationships. The parent's intention was to ensure the kids are adjusting well, not to criticize the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling undermined, but the parent's action was part of his role as a parent.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the parent should have considered the girlfriend's feelings. But the parent had a responsibility to his children's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but does that make the parent at fault? It seems like the parent acted appropriately in his duty as a parent. The girlfriend's insecurity might be the issue here. The parent isn't the one causing the conflict; he's addressing his children's needs. So, the answer would be B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
