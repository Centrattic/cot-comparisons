My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job and was asked to pick up the kids, leading to tension. The author then talks to his oldest son about how he feels about the girlfriend and the situation. The girlfriend finds out and reacts strongly, feeling undermined.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's intention was to check in on his son's well-being and ensure the kids aren't being negatively affected by the changes. He didn't consult the girlfriend first, but he argues that he needs to be able to talk to his kids about family matters without prior approval. \n\nIs talking to his son about the girlfriend a betrayal? Well, parents often discuss family dynamics with their kids. However, the girlfriend might feel that the conversation was about her, leading to feeling undermined. But the author mentions the conversation was also about the kids' mother being away, so maybe it wasn't entirely about the girlfriend.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's a parent who is engaging with his child, which is a natural part of parenting. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but communication is key in relationships. The author might have handled it differently by including the girlfriend, but the act of talking to his son isn't inherently wrong. He's fulfilling his role as a parent, ensuring his child's feelings are considered. The girlfriend's insecurity or feeling of betrayal could be a separate issue. The author's action was in the best interest of the child, not to undermine the girlfriend. So, B (Not in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
