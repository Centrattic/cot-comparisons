My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is upset because he discussed her with his oldest son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The parent wanted to check in with his son about how he's adjusting to the new living situation, especially since the girlfriend was taking over some responsibilities like picking up the kids. The parent had a conversation with the son, which the girlfriend found offensive, feeling undermined. \n\nThe parent argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his children without needing permission from his girlfriend. The kids are his responsibility, so discussing their well-being makes sense. However, the girlfriend's reaction is strong, feeling betrayed and not confident in the parent's maturity.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important to maintain open communication with children, especially regarding their living situation and caregivers. The parent's intention was to assess the child's feelings, which is a responsible action. However, the way the conversation was approached might have been a factor. Did he mention the girlfriend in a negative light? The parent says the conversation was as much about the ex-wife's absence as about the girlfriend, so maybe not.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the parent didn't consult her before discussing her with the child, which could be seen as a breach of trust. In relationships, partners often expect a certain level of discussion before involving children in such topics, especially when it relates to the partner's role in their lives.\n\nThe parent's action could be seen as necessary for the child's well-being, but the approach might have been a misstep in terms of relationship dynamics. It's possible that the parent didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings about being discussed with the child without prior discussion. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling that her role in the family is being questioned or criticized through the child's perspective.\n\nIn many cases, communication between partners about parenting decisions is crucial. If the parent had discussed with the girlfriend first, that might have prevented the conflict. However, the parent was acting in the child's best interest, which is a valid reason. The key here is whether the parent's action was a breach of trust or just a necessary part of parenting.\n\nConsidering all angles, the parent isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to check in with his son. However, the lack of communication with the girlfriend beforehand could be a point of contention. The answer might be a balance between the parent's responsibility to the child and the girlfriend's feelings in the relationship. But since the parent's primary duty is to the child's well-being, the answer could lean towards not being in the wrong, especially if the conversation was neutral and not malicious.\n"
