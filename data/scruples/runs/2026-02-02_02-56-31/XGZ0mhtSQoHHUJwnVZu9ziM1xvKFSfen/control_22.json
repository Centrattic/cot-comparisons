My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (a father) had a conversation with his older son about how the son perceives his girlfriend and the mom who's away. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The father is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's intentions. He says he had the conversation because he was concerned about his kids' well-being, especially after hearing comments that the girlfriend's behavior might not be supportive enough. He wanted to check in with his son to make sure he wasn't being affected negatively. That seems reasonable as a parent wanting to ensure their child's adjustment.\n\nBut the girlfriend felt it was an attack on her. The father didn't discuss this with her first. Even if the intention was good, not communicating with a partner about discussing them with the kids could come off as undermining. Partners might feel their authority or position in the child's life is being questioned without their input.\n\nHowever, the father is also a parent, so he has the right to talk to his children about their family dynamics. The conversation wasn't necessarily negative; he mentions the son was happy. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate\u2014leaving the house and threatening to rethink the relationship might be overreacting. But the key point is whether the father crossed a boundary by not consulting her first.\n\nIn co-parenting or step-parent situations, communication between adults is important. The father might have a right to discuss his children's feelings, but involving the girlfriend in that discussion without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. However, if the conversation wasn't critical but just informational, maybe it's justified.\n\nAnother angle: the father was trying to address potential issues in the house. If the son's perception of the girlfriend was important, the father needed to know. But if the girlfriend felt it was an affront to her, maybe the method was wrong. It's a balance between parental responsibility and respecting a partner's feelings.\n\nSo, is the father wrong? He had good intentions, but maybe he should have discussed the conversation with his girlfriend first to avoid making her feel undermined. However, since he's a parent, he might need the autonomy to talk to his kids. The girlfriend's reaction might be part of the issue too. Maybe there's a communication breakdown. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI think it's a bit of a judgment call. On one hand, the father's actions were to ensure his child's well-being. On the other hand, not discussing it with his girlfriend could be seen as disrespectful. Since the girlfriend is a co-parent in the household, sharing that information might be necessary. But the father isn't wrong for wanting to know how his son feels. The answer might hinge on intent versus perception. If the father didn't go into the conversation to criticize the girlfriend, then maybe he's not wrong. However, the way he approached it without her knowledge could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. His intent was to check on his son's well-being, and while he could have handled it differently, the action itself isn't wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is part of the issue, but the father isn't the asshole here.\n"
