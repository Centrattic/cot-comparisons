My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a dad with two kids, living with his girlfriend. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week. She was upset and called him an asshole. Then, after some comments on Reddit suggested the kids might be affected, he talked to his oldest son about how he perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, saying he undermined her and that he has no confidence in her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether talking to his son about his girlfriend is something a parent should do. Parents usually have a right to talk to their kids about their well-being and family dynamics. The author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which could be seen as responsible parenting. However, the girlfriend's reaction is important too. She might feel that discussing her in front of the child could damage her image or create tension. \n\nBut wait, the parent is allowed to discuss the child's relationships with them, right? Like, if a child has a step-parent or caregiver, it's normal to talk about how they feel about that person. The issue might be whether the parent went about it in a way that was respectful of the girlfriend's feelings. However, the parent isn't obligated to consult the girlfriend first about every conversation with his child. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that being discussed without her knowledge is a betrayal. But the parent isn't badmouthing her; he's just having an open conversation with his child. The key point is that the parent's action was for the child's benefit, not to undermine the girlfriend. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably isn't in the wrong. He had a valid reason to talk to his son, and as an adult, he should be able to have that conversation without needing permission. The girlfriend's reaction seems overblown, but that's her issue, not his. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
