My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a father with two kids, living with his girlfriend. His girlfriend lost her job and took on more responsibility, like picking up the kids. She was upset about that, leading to previous tension. Then, the author decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about his feelings regarding his mother being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house and wants to reevaluate the relationship. The author is defending his right to talk to his kids without her approval.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father's intent to check in on his child's well-being, the girlfriend's reaction feeling undermined, and the question of whether the father overstepped.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to talk to their children about family dynamics. The father's action seems motivated by concern for his son's emotional state, especially after previous feedback about the girlfriend's behavior affecting the kids. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that discussing her with the child without her consent might have made her feel disrespected. But is that a valid reason for her reaction?\n\nFrom a parental standpoint, ensuring that children feel comfortable and aren't being negatively impacted by family changes is important. The father didn't do it to undermine the girlfriend; he mentioned the conversation was also about the mother's absence. However, the girlfriend might feel her authority or presence in the household is being questioned. But since the father is the parent, talking to his child is part of his role. \n\nThere could be a communication issue. The father could have considered discussing his intentions with the girlfriend beforehand, but he wasn't required to get her permission to talk to his child. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a boundary being crossed, but the father isn't wrong for prioritizing his child's well-being. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend's reaction being extreme (calling him a 6-year-old) might indicate her own issues. The father isn't in the wrong for doing his parental duty. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
