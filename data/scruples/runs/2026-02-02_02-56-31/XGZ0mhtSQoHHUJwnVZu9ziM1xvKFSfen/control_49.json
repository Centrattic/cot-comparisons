My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The man lives with his girlfriend and his two children. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to help with the kids a few days a week, which led to conflict. Then, after some Reddit feedback about the kids sensing the girlfriend's lack of interest, he talked to his son about how he feels about everything, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend took offense, thinking he undermined her, and now she's upset and considering leaving the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' roles and boundaries. The father had a legitimate concern about his son's perception of the situation, especially since the girlfriend's behavior might affect the kids. As a parent, he has a responsibility to ensure his children feel supported and safe. Talking to his son about his feelings and the dynamics in the household is part of that duty. However, the girlfriend felt her autonomy was invaded, which is a valid feeling, especially if she wasn't consulted beforehand.\n\nBut the question is whether the father was wrong. Legally and ethically, parents have the right to discuss their children's well-being with them. The conversation was about the children's experiences, not just the girlfriend. However, the way he approached it might have been a misstep. Perhaps he could have involved the girlfriend in the conversation to maintain mutual respect, but the main issue is the father's right to talk to his own child about his own family dynamics.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. The father isn't undermining her by checking in with his son. The son's well-being is paramount, and the father's action was about understanding his son's feelings, which is a parent's role. The girlfriend might need to work on her response and communication, but the father isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No), because the father was acting in his children's best interest and as a parent has the right to talk to them without needing permission from the girlfriend.\n"
