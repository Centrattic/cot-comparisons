My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the user lives with their girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the user asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to conflict. Then the user talked to their oldest son (14) about how he feels regarding the girlfriend and his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined.\n\nSo the main question is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was wrong. The user's intention was to check in on the kids' well-being, which makes sense because kids can sense tension. The girlfriend, however, feels it's a betrayal and lack of confidence in her.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The parent has a responsibility to their children's emotional health. Discussing how the kids feel about the living situation and the new girlfriend is part of that responsibility. The parent didn't do it to undermine the girlfriend but to ensure the kids are okay. However, the girlfriend might feel that the parent didn't consult her first or that it's intrusive. But since the kids are the parent's children, they have the right to talk to them about their family dynamics.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the conversation was about both the ex-wife (mother) being away and the girlfriend. The parent didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to understand the kids' perspectives. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since the parent is acting in the kids' best interest. The parent is an adult and should be able to discuss their children's feelings without needing permission from a partner. \n\nSo, from a responsibility and parental rights standpoint, the parent isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is more about feeling disrespected, but the parent's actions were justified. Therefore, the answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
