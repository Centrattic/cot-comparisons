My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So the situation is that he's talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he's undermining her and questioning his maturity. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a previous issue where his girlfriend was supposed to take care of the kids and she got upset. Then he had a conversation with his son about how he feels about the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend took offense and left.\n\nThe key points here are about the parent-child relationship and the boundaries in a relationship. As a parent, he might feel the need to check in with his children about their feelings, especially if there were concerns raised previously. But the girlfriend might see that conversation as a criticism of her parenting or presence in the kids' lives without her consent.\n\nIn many cases, when discussing a child's feelings about someone in the family, especially a partner, it's important to approach it carefully. The father's intention was to ensure his son's well-being and address any potential issues. However, if the conversation was framed in a way that made the girlfriend feel criticized or if he didn't approach it with sensitivity, that could lead to conflict. \n\nAlso, considering that they live together and have a shared responsibility for the children, there's an expectation of communication. However, the father might believe that as a parent, he has the right to discuss his child's feelings without needing permission. The girlfriend might feel that this conversation was a breach of trust or respect, especially if it was done in a way that didn't consider her perspective.\n\nThe author's defense is that he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids without prior approval. That's a valid point because parents do need to have these discussions. However, if the conversation was perceived as a criticism or if he didn't balance the input from both the son's and the girlfriend's viewpoints, it could be problematic. The fact that the girlfriend reacted strongly suggests that she felt her role or presence was being questioned, which can be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, if the father approached the conversation with the intention of understanding his son's feelings and not to undermine the girlfriend, then he might not be in the wrong. But the girlfriend's reaction indicates that the way it was handled might have been hurtful. The key here is the intent versus the impact. Even if the intent was good, the impact on the girlfriend was negative.\n\nSo, considering all that, it's a bit of a grey area. However, since the father is a parent and needs to communicate with his children about their well-being, I might lean towards him not being the asshole. But the way he approached the conversation and whether he considered the girlfriend's feelings could affect that. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that he had a valid reason to talk to his son, I think the answer might be No.\n"
