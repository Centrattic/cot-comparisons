My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the kid perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the user, their girlfriend, two kids, and some previous issues where the girlfriend was upset about being asked to take care of the kids. Now, the user had a conversation with their oldest son to check how he feels about the living arrangement and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out, got really upset, and left, saying the user lacks confidence in her and is childish.\n\nSo, the user is wondering if they did something wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to check in with their son about his feelings, which is a common and responsible thing for a parent to do. They wanted to make sure their kids are adjusting well to the new living situation and the presence of the girlfriend. It's good parenting to stay aware of the kids' emotional states.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt undermined and that the user doesn't trust her. The key issue here is whether discussing the girlfriend's role with the son was appropriate. The user argues that they needed to talk to their kids without needing permission from the girlfriend. But the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt her relationship with the child was being questioned or criticized.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, the user's action was to communicate with their child, which is their right as a parent. However, maybe the way they approached the conversation could have been different. If the user didn't go into the conversation with the intent to critique the girlfriend but to understand the child's perspective, then it's justified. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect the dynamic between them, especially if the child is young.\n\nBut here, the son is 14, an older child who might be able to handle such a conversation. The user also mentioned that the conversation included other topics, like the mother's absence. The problem arises when the user didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings beforehand. Even though it's a parent's right to talk to their kids, if it's about the other parent figure in the house, communication between the adults might have been necessary to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nBut the user might not be obligated to clear every conversation with their girlfriend, especially if it's about their own children. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, possibly because she feels her position in the household is being questioned. However, the user's action was to ensure the child's well-being, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the user's action was a responsible parenting move. The issue might be more about the girlfriend's reaction than the user's action. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
