My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is a parent with two kids and a girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the user asked her to pick up the kids. She got upset and called him an asshole. Then, the user talked to his oldest son (14) about his thoughts on the situation, including his feelings about the girlfriend and his mother. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that he's trying to ensure his kids are okay, especially since the previous comments suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of engagement. He wanted to check in with his son, which seems like a responsible move. However, the girlfriend feels her boundaries were crossed.\n\nSo, the key points here are: parental responsibility vs. partner's privacy. The user is a parent; talking to his kids is part of his role. The girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without her consent is a breach of trust. But the user argues that he's an adult and needs to be able to talk to his children about their well-being.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, parents should be able to discuss their children's feelings and well-being. On the other, the girlfriend might feel that being discussed without her knowledge is disrespectful. However, the user didn't intend to undermine her; he was focused on the child's perspective.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user might have handled it differently. Maybe he should have included the girlfriend in the conversation or explained his intentions. But the act of talking to the son about his feelings isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but the user's action seems justified as a parent's duty. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014he's not in the wrong.\n"
