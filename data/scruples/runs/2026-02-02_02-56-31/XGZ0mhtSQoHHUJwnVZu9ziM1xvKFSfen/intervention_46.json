My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is a father who lives with his girlfriend and two sons. He had a previous issue where his girlfriend was upset when he asked her to help with the kids after she lost her job. Now, he's talking to his oldest son (14) about how the son perceives him and his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The user is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' responsibilities. The user wants to understand his children's feelings, which is a valid concern. Talking to his son about the living situation, including the girlfriend, might be necessary to ensure the kids are adjusting well. But the girlfriend feels her privacy or authority is being questioned. \n\nIs the father overstepping? Well, he's the parent, so he has a right to talk to his kids about their well-being. However, the girlfriend might see it as a critique of her role as a step-parent. Maybe he didn't explain his intentions clearly. The conversation was partly about the girlfriend, but also about the ex-wife being away. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings are valid because she might feel criticized without being consulted. \n\nHowever, the father isn't supposed to have to get permission to talk to his own children. The kids' emotional state is his responsibility. The girlfriend's insecurity might be causing her to take it personally. The father's action was appropriate for a parent, even if it made the girlfriend uncomfortable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). But maybe there's a way to handle it more sensitively next time. The father isn't the asshole here.\n"
