My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 44-year-old dad living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids a few days a week, which led to conflict. Now, the author talked to his oldest son about how the son feels about the girlfriend and about his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined. She left the house, saying the author doesn't trust her and that he's acting immature.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to check in with his son's feelings about the family situation, including the girlfriend. The key point here is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was appropriate. The author argues that he's a parent and needs to be able to talk to his kids without needing permission. The girlfriend feels it was a betrayal and that he doesn't trust her.\n\nNow, considering the context, when parents are in a relationship, especially with kids, communication is important. The author's concern about the kids' well-being makes sense. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but maybe she's sensitive because she's dealing with job loss and the new role as a step-parent. The author might have approached the conversation without considering how the girlfriend would view it. Even though the kids' feelings are important, discussing the girlfriend directly with the child could make her feel criticized or not trusted, especially if it's not done carefully.\n\nThe author did mention that the conversation was also about the mother's trip, so it's not entirely about the girlfriend. But the way it was framed might have made the girlfriend feel targeted. In relationships, transparency and communication between partners are crucial. Maybe the author didn't discuss his plans to talk to the son with the girlfriend first, leading to misunderstandings. Even though the author has the right to talk to his kids, how he approached it might be the issue here. The girlfriend's reaction, while extreme, might be a result of feeling untrusted or not respected in the new family dynamics.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with the son without considering her feelings. The answer could be that he acted without considering the girlfriend's perspective, even if his intention was good. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not communicating with the girlfriend first about his intentions.\n"
