My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a father, talked to his son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, thinking it was an attack on her. The author's intention was to check in on his kids' well-being, considering the girlfriend's recent job loss and her role in their lives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The father has a responsibility to ensure his children's emotional well-being. Talking to his son about how he feels about his mother being away and about the girlfriend seems like a reasonable step to assess the kids' adjustment. The father isn't directly criticizing the girlfriend; he's just seeking the child's perspective.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt undermined. Maybe she felt that discussing her with the child without her input made him question her capability. But the father's action was to consult the child, not to undermine the girlfriend. The key here is intent versus perception. The father's intent was to check on his son, not to criticize the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or feeling mistrusted.\n\nIn these situations, communication is important. The father might need to address the girlfriend's feelings, but that doesn't mean the initial action was wrong. The father is an adult and has the right to talk to his children about their lives without needing to get permission from his partner. The main issue is whether the father overstepped. Since he was concerned about his son's adjustment and sought his opinion, it seems reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but that doesn't necessarily make the father right in her eyes, but in terms of right or wrong, the father's action was about the child's well-being. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
