My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves a live-in girlfriend who's been stressed after losing her job, and the parent wanted to check in with their oldest son about how he's feeling with the changes. The girlfriend took offense and is now upset, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They mentioned they had a wake-up call from comments about the kids sensing the girlfriend's reluctance. So the parent wanted to ensure the kids weren't being negatively affected. That seems like a responsible action. Talking to one's child about their feelings and the people around them is usually a good thing, right? Especially when there's a major life change like a parent's job loss and a new partner in the household.\n\nBut the girlfriend perceived it as undermining her. Why? Maybe she felt that discussing her in front of the child, even if it was about the child's own perceptions, made her feel insecure or mistrusted. The parent says they didn't go to the son to undermine but to check on the kid's well-being. However, communication styles matter here. How did the conversation go? Was it a balanced discussion where the son could express his thoughts without feeling like he's being used to judge the girlfriend?\n\nAlso, the parent mentions they talked about both the mother's absence and the girlfriend. Maybe the way it was framed made the girlfriend feel like she was being compared or evaluated. If the parent didn't explain the context properly to the son, the child might have felt like he was in the middle, which could cause stress for him too.\n\nBut then again, parents should have the autonomy to discuss their children's feelings about the people in their lives, especially if those people are part of the household. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014calling it betrayal and comparing the parent to a 6-year-old. That might indicate her own insecurities or issues with the parent's communication approach.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent overstepped by discussing the girlfriend in a way that's critical or judgmental. The parent claims it was to assess the son's well-being, not to criticize the girlfriend. If the conversation was neutral and focused on the child's perspective, then it's reasonable. But if the parent was leading the son to evaluate the girlfriend negatively, that would be a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without her knowledge breaches trust. Even if the parent didn't mean to, sharing such information could affect the child's dynamics with her. The parent might not have considered the girlfriend's perspective and the potential impact of involving the child in adult matters without her consent.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The parent could have approached the girlfriend first to express concerns about the kids' perceptions instead of talking to the son directly. That way, they could address any issues together. However, the parent's intention was to check on the kids, not to involve the girlfriend in a conflict.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? It's a balance. They had a valid reason to talk to their son, but maybe the approach could have been better. Not discussing it with the girlfriend first might have been a misstep. But the act of talking to the child itself isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is also a factor\u2014her taking it as betrayal suggests deeper issues in the relationship. The parent might need to address how they communicate in the future, but they aren't necessarily the asshole for trying to understand their child's feelings.\n"
