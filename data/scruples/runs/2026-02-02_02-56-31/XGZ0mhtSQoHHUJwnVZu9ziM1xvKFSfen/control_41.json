My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking to his son about how he perceives the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she feels undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two sons, aged 8 and 14, and he's living with his girlfriend. The older son had a conversation with the author about his feelings regarding his mother being away and his stepmother. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks the author didn't have confidence in her and that he breached trust by talking to the son about her. \n\nSo the key points are: the author wanted to check in with his son about his well-being, especially since the girlfriend was recently unemployed and taking on responsibilities. The conversation included both the son's mother (his ex) and the girlfriend. The author didn't inform the girlfriend beforehand, and now she's reacting strongly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a parenting perspective, it's important to communicate with children about their feelings and their relationships with caregivers. The author's intention was to ensure his son's happiness and to address any potential issues early. However, the way he approached it might have been a problem. Did he need to discuss the girlfriend specifically? Maybe the son brought it up naturally, but the author's decision to talk to the son could be seen as necessary for the child's emotional health.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She feels betrayed and undermined. She might have wanted to present herself as a stable figure in the kids' lives, and the author discussing her with the son without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. But is it reasonable for her to expect that the author would consult her first? In a healthy relationship, the author should be able to talk to his children about their relationships with caregivers without prior approval. The children's well-being is a priority.\n\nAnother angle: The author mentions that the conversation was also about the son's mother being away, so the focus wasn't entirely on the girlfriend. The son was happy overall, so the author didn't find any issues. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if that's the case. However, maybe she's feeling insecure or sensitive about her role as a stepmother. \n\nIs the author wrong for not discussing this with the girlfriend first? It depends on the relationship dynamics. In some cases, couples might agree on how to handle such conversations. But the author is the parent; he has a responsibility to his children's emotional well-being. Unless there's a specific agreement that all discussions with the kids about the girlfriend need her consent, it's within his rights as a parent to talk to his children. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of leaving the house and saying the author has the maturity of a 6-year-old seems overreactive. The author isn't doing anything harmful; he's checking in on his son. So while the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the author isn't in the wrong for doing what's necessary for his child. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
