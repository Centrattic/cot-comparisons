My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves a live-in girlfriend who lost her job, and she's upset because he asked her to pick up the kids, leading to a conflict. Now, he talked to his oldest son about the situation, including his girlfriend, which made her leave the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents have a duty to check in with their children's well-being, especially when there are significant changes in the household, like a new partner. The son is 14, so it's reasonable to discuss his feelings about the living arrangements and the new girlfriend. The user's intention was to ensure the kids are okay, not to undermine the girlfriend. However, the girlfriend felt betrayed and undermined, which is valid because she might have felt that discussing her with the child without her knowledge was a breach of trust.\n\nThe user argues that they didn't go to the son to undermine the girlfriend but to assess the children's adjustment. But from the girlfriend's perspective, being discussed in this way without her knowledge could feel like a lack of respect. The key here is whether the parent should have discussed the girlfriend's role with the son in a way that the girlfriend felt blindsided. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Even though the parent has a right to talk to their children, doing so in a way that doesn't consider the partner's feelings might be problematic. The parent might not be in the wrong entirely because checking on the kids' feelings is part of their responsibility, but the approach might have been handled better. Maybe discussing concerns with the girlfriend first would have been better, even if the intention was to check with the kids. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense, but given the existing tension from the previous situation (her losing her job and the conflict over picking up the kids), this could have been a tipping point. The parent might not be the asshole, but there's room for improvement in how they handle such sensitive topics. So the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong), but with a note that communication could be better.\n"
