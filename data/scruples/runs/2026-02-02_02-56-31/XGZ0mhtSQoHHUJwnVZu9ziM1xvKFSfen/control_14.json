My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a parent who talks to his son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend gets upset, thinking it's an underhanded way to undermine her. The author's main argument is that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being and the changes in their lives, like their mother being away and the new girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents should be able to communicate with their children about family dynamics, especially when there are significant changes. The author mentions that previous comments on his Reddit post suggested that the kids might pick up on the girlfriend's behavior, so he wanted to check in with them. That seems like a responsible action to ensure the kids are okay.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt betrayed and undermined. The key here is whether the author's actions crossed a line. The author didn't say he told the son negative things about the girlfriend, but just asked for the son's thoughts. But maybe the girlfriend felt that even asking the child her opinion was a way to criticize her. \n\nThe author argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without clearing it with his girlfriend. That makes sense because parents need to have open communication with their children. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect the child's perception, especially if there's any underlying tension.\n\nAnother angle is the context from the previous Reddit post. The author had asked the girlfriend to take care of the kids, which led to conflict. So maybe the girlfriend feels that the author is using the kids to target her. But the author's intention was to check in with the kids, not to criticize the girlfriend. \n\nI think it's important to consider the relationship between the parent, the girlfriend, and the kids. If the girlfriend is part of the household, she might expect some level of communication. However, the parent has a right to discuss family matters with their children. The conflict here might stem from miscommunication rather than the act itself. The author isn't the asshole if his intention was to ensure the kids are okay, but the way he approached it might have hurt the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he had a valid reason to talk to his son about the family situation, then he's justified. However, if he made the discussion about the girlfriend's shortcomings without cause, that's different. The author states the conversation was about the mother's trip and the girlfriend equally. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he had a legitimate concern for his children's well-being. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He had a responsibility to ensure his children were adjusting well, and discussing it with them is appropriate. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to her own insecurities or misinterpretation, but the author's actions were justified.\n"
