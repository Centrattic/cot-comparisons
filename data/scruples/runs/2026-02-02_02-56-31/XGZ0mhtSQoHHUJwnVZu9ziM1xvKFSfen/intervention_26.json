My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the user living with his girlfriend and two kids. He's been supporting his girlfriend after her job loss, asked her to help with the kids, which caused some conflict. Then he talked to his older son about how the son feels, which upset the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user did something wrong. The user's intention was to check in with his son about how he's adjusting, especially since the mother is away and the girlfriend is involved. The girlfriend took offense, feeling undermined and betrayed. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important to ensure that a child's feelings are considered, especially when there are changes in family dynamics. The user's action seems to be in the best interest of the child. However, the way it was handled might have issues. The user didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings and didn't communicate with her before talking to the child. This could have been a breach of trust from her viewpoint.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? Well, as a parent, he has a responsibility to his children. However, involving his girlfriend in the children's lives without her consent might be an issue. The problem is whether the conversation with the son was appropriate. Since the son is 14, discussing how he perceives the girlfriend is reasonable, but the parent should probably also be transparent with the girlfriend to avoid misunderstandings. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense, but that doesn't necessarily mean the user is wrong. He did what he thought was necessary for his son. However, not discussing the conversation with the girlfriend first might have been a misstep. The user's responsibility to his children is important, but communication with all parties is crucial in blended families. \n\nSo, the user's action was not inherently wrong, but maybe there's a need for better communication. The answer would hinge on balancing parental duties with respect for the partner's role. Since the user's primary duty is to his children, he's not in the wrong, but he might need to improve how he handles such situations to avoid future conflicts.\n"
