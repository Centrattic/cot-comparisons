My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a 44-year-old man, talks to his son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author's reasoning is that he needed to talk to his kids without prior approval from his girlfriend, and the conversation wasn't just about her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The user is a parent, so he has a responsibility to his children's well-being. The previous post mentioned that the girlfriend was upset about being asked to pick up the kids, leading to a conflict. Now, the user is addressing the girlfriend's reaction to talking to his son. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author cross a boundary by discussing his girlfriend in front of his son? Is it necessary for parents to talk to their children about their caregivers without the other adult's input? \n\nIn many cases, parents should be able to discuss any adult in their child's life, including a new partner, to ensure the child's comfort and safety. However, the way the conversation was approached might matter. If the son was confused or if the parent came off as critical, that could cause issues. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but emotions can run high in such situations. \n\nBut the author is an adult, and he's discussing his relationship with his children. Unless there was prior agreement that they wouldn't talk about the girlfriend, he's within his rights to have that conversation. The problem might be the girlfriend feeling that her authority or presence in the household is being challenged. \n\nHowever, the main point is whether the author's action was wrong. Since parents are responsible for their children's emotional states, talking to them about their perception of a caregiver (the girlfriend) is a reasonable action. The girlfriend might need to understand that the parent's primary duty is to the children. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's acting in his children's best interest by checking in with them. The girlfriend's overreaction might be the real issue here, not the author's conversation.\n"
