My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two kids with an ex-wife, lives with his current girlfriend, who lost her job and is now helping with the kids. He asked her to pick up the kids a few days a week, which led to an argument. Then, he talked to his oldest son about how the son feels about the new girlfriend and the mom being away. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The father's intention was to check in on his son's well-being regarding the changes in his family situation, including the new girlfriend. He didn't do this with malicious intent towards his girlfriend but to ensure the child wasn't being negatively affected. However, the girlfriend felt that this conversation was a criticism of her and a lack of trust.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, parents generally have the right to discuss their children's feelings and family dynamics. The father's action seems to be a responsible and caring approach to his son's emotional state. However, the way he communicated might have been a problem. If he discussed the girlfriend in a way that made her feel criticized, even if unintentionally, that could be an issue. But the main question is whether he's in the wrong for having the conversation in the first place.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but people in relationships might have different expectations. However, the father isn't obligated to consult his girlfriend before talking to his own children about their lives. The children are his responsibility, and checking in with them is a normal part of parenting. The girlfriend's feeling of betrayal might stem from insecurity or a lack of communication, but the father isn't wrong for prioritizing his children's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the father could have handled it more sensitively. Perhaps he could have discussed with the girlfriend first if there were concerns about how the son perceives her. However, the scenario doesn't indicate that the father had prior issues or that the girlfriend was involved in the parenting decisions. Since the son is his child, the father has a right to discuss important family matters with him without needing the girlfriend's approval.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
