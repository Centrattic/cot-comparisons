My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about his perception of the boyfriend. The situation is that the user has two kids, lives with their girlfriend, and she was upset when they talked to their son about her. The user had a previous issue where the girlfriend was supposed to pick up the kids but got angry.\n\nSo the user wanted to check how the kids were doing, especially since the ex-wife isn't around. They went to talk to their oldest son, who was happy, but the girlfriend found out and flipped out. She felt undermined and left the house. The user is frustrated because they think it's normal to talk to their kids and not have to get permission from their partner.\n\nHmm, from a parenting perspective, it's important to communicate with children about your relationships and how changes affect them. If the kids are under the father's care, he should be able to discuss things with them. But the girlfriend might feel that the user is not trusting her if he's talking about her directly with the kids. However, the user did mention talking about both the ex-wife's trip and the girlfriend, so maybe it wasn't just about the girlfriend.\n\nIs there a boundary being crossed here? The user is the parent, so it's their responsibility to talk to their kids about their lives. The girlfriend might feel excluded or not trusted, but the parent should have the right to discuss their family dynamics with their children. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe there's underlying tension from the previous incident where she was called an asshole.\n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because they're doing their duty as a parent to check in on their child's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction is more about feeling disrespected, but the parent shouldn't need permission to talk to their own child. However, maybe the user could have involved the girlfriend in the conversation about the kids' well-being to avoid misunderstandings. But the main issue is that the user is a parent and needs to have those discussions. So the answer is B.\n"
