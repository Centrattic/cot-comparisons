My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a father living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend just lost her job, and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which she took offense to. Then he had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son perceives the girlfriend, which made the girlfriend upset. She felt undermined and left the house.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether talking to his son about his girlfriend was appropriate. He mentioned that after the previous incident where the girlfriend was upset about being asked to take care of the kids, he wanted to check in with his son about how he feels. The son was okay with it. But the girlfriend felt betrayed and undermined. \n\nNow, as a parent, he has a responsibility to ensure his children's well-being. Discussing how the kids feel about their caregiver is part of that responsibility. However, he didn't consult the girlfriend before having the conversation. The girlfriend might see this as a breach of trust, especially if they're in a committed relationship where such discussions might be expected to be shared first with the partner. \n\nOn the other hand, the father might argue that he has a duty to his children and that he didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend. The conversation was also about the mother being away, so it's not entirely about the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe she feels insecure or that her position is being questioned. \n\nIt's tricky because both parties have valid points. The father acted in the best interest of his children, but maybe without considering the girlfriend's feelings. However, in a blended family, the dynamics are complex. The father needs to balance his parental duties with the relationship with his girlfriend. But the girlfriend might feel that her privacy and input are disregarded. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe he should have discussed with the girlfriend first, but if the kids are his primary responsibility, he might not need her permission. But in a relationship, communication is key. Maybe he should have been more transparent. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the father's action of talking to his son without the girlfriend's knowledge was a breach of trust or necessary for the child's well-being. Given that the father's actions were to check his children's welfare and ensure they're okay, which is a parent's responsibility, he might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but her feelings are valid too. However, since the father's intent was to ensure the child's well-being and not to undermine the girlfriend, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, there's a caveat that he could have approached it differently for smoother communication. But according to the question's parameters, it's a yes or no. So based on the analysis, the answer is B.\n"
