My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the kid perceives his girlfriend. They previously had an issue where the girlfriend got upset when he asked her to pick up the kids, and now after talking to his son, the girlfriend is furious, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents should communicate with their children about various aspects of their lives, especially when there are significant changes like a new partner. The son is 8 and 14; the oldest is 14. Talking to the older child about how he feels about the new girlfriend and the situation with his mom makes sense to ensure he's adjusting well.\n\nBut the girlfriend felt betrayed. The parent didn't consult her before the conversation. Even though the parent's intention was to check in with the child, the girlfriend might see it as a lack of trust. However, the parent is also responsible for their children's well-being, so they need to be able to discuss things with them without needing permission from their partner, especially since the partner isn't the child's parent.\n\nThe key points: The parent had a valid reason to talk to the son about his feelings. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, possibly due to insecurity or feeling disrespected. The parent isn't wrong for wanting to ensure their child is okay. However, maybe they could have approached it differently, like involving the girlfriend more or explaining the conversation afterward to avoid misunderstandings. But the core action\u2014talking to the child\u2014is necessary and not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, not in the wrong). The parent isn't the asshole here. They're doing their duty as a parent, even if the communication could have been better with the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own issues than the parent's action being wrong.\n"
