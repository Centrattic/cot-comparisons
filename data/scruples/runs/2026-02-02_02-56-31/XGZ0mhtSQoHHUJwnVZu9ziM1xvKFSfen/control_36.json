My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me read the details again.\n\nThe author is a dad living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to an argument where she called him an asshole. Then, after people commented that the kids might sense her not wanting to be there, he talked to his oldest son about his feelings regarding his mom being away, living with them, and his opinion of the girlfriend. The son was happy, but when the girlfriend found out, she was upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, saying the author lacks confidence in her. She left the house to stay with a friend and wants to rethink the relationship. The author is now seeking validation if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the author's intention was to check in with his son about his feelings, including his perception of the girlfriend. The author believes he's just doing his job as a parent to understand his kids' well-being. The girlfriend, however, feels that talking to the son about her is a betrayal and lacks confidence in her. The author isn't in high school, so the comparison is just a metaphor for drama.\n\nNow, determining if he's in the wrong. Parents should communicate with their children about various topics, including their relationships and the people around them. It's part of being a parent to ensure the child's emotional state. However, the context here is that the author is in a relationship with the girlfriend. The girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without prior discussion could affect the child's perception of her or create tension. But the author's intent was to check on the child's feelings, not to criticize the girlfriend. The son was happy, so maybe the author's approach was okay.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should have considered his girlfriend's feelings beforehand. Since they live together and she's involved in the kids' lives, sharing that information might have been necessary. But the question is whether the author is wrong for having that conversation. Since the kids are his responsibility, he has the right to talk to them about their lives, including their step-parent. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, possibly because of underlying tensions from the previous argument about the school pickup. The author's action was in the best interest of his child, and unless he was using the child to criticize the girlfriend, it's not his fault. The girlfriend's response might be due to her own insecurities or the existing conflict. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
