My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the kid perceives the girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the user is a parent with two kids, living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job and the user is supporting her. The user asked her to pick up the kids from school, which she didn't like. Then he talked to his older son about his thoughts on the girlfriend and his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe user's argument is that he needed to check in with his child about how he's feeling, especially since Reddit comments mentioned kids sensing tension. He didn't think it was a big deal but now the girlfriend is upset. He feels like he's not wrong because he's a parent and needs to talk to his kids without permission, and the conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parent was wrong to have that conversation. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, parents have a responsibility to their children's well-being. Talking to a child about their feelings, including their perception of a stepparent, can be important for the child's emotional health. The parent might have valid reasons to ensure the child isn't feeling neglected or confused, especially during a time when the mother is away. The parent didn't go to the child to criticize the girlfriend directly but to discuss the child's adjustment. So from a parenting perspective, this seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. She might feel that discussing her in such a way with the child, without her knowledge, is a breach of trust. Even if the parent's intent was good, the girlfriend could perceive it as undermining her authority or position in the household. Since the child is under the parent's care, but the girlfriend is a partner, there might be expectations of mutual respect and prior communication. The parent might not have considered that the child's comments could affect the girlfriend's feelings or perception of the parent's support.\n\nFactors to consider: The child's age (14 years old is old enough to have such discussions) and the context (discussing family dynamics). The parent's intention was to check on the child's adjustment, not to criticize the girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she feels disrespected or not trusted. The parent might not have communicated with the girlfriend beforehand, considering it necessary to talk to the child directly. \n\nBut should a parent need permission from a partner to talk to their child about family matters? Probably not. However, in a close relationship, especially involving step-parenting, communication between both adults might be important to maintain harmony. The parent might have handled it differently, perhaps discussing with the girlfriend first or framing the conversation carefully to avoid making her feel targeted.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention was to check on the child's well-being, the execution might have been insensitive to the girlfriend's feelings. The parent is not wrong in wanting to talk to their child, but perhaps the approach could have been better managed to consider the girlfriend's perspective. So, the answer might be a bit nuanced. But since the user is asking for a Yes or No answer (A/B), the key is whether the parent is the asshole. If the parent acted with good intent and the girlfriend's reaction is overblown, then the answer is B. But if the parent should have discussed it with the girlfriend first, then A.\n"
