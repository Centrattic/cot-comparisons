My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. From the context, the user has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and the girlfriend recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to conflict. Now, after advice from Reddit, he talked to his oldest son about his feelings towards the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, which seems reasonable. As a parent, he has a responsibility to ensure his children are comfortable, especially with significant changes like a parent living with a new partner. The conversation was about the son's mother being away and the girlfriend, so the user's concern was valid.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt her trust was violated. The user didn't inform her before talking to the son. While parents need to talk to their kids about such matters, the way the conversation was approached without considering the girlfriend's feelings might have been a misstep. The user might have assumed that discussing the kids' feelings was necessary without considering the girlfriend's perspective. \n\nBut balancing both needs: the parent's duty to their children and the partner's need for trust. The key here is whether the user had a right to discuss the girlfriend's role with the son. The user's action was for the child's benefit, but the method could have been handled better. Maybe a prior discussion with the girlfriend to set expectations would have prevented the conflict. However, the user is also an adult with a right to talk to his children about their lives. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feeling of being undermined is understandable if she wasn't consulted. The user might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication. Since the primary concern was the child's well-being, the answer leans towards the user not being in the wrong, but he could have handled it more sensitively. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong), but with the note that communication could be better. But strictly based on the question: is he in the wrong? The answer would be B.\n"
