My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic with two children, a girlfriend, and previous issues where the girlfriend was upset about being asked to look after the kids.\n\nThe author's main action here is having a conversation with his son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. He mentions that he was advised in a previous Reddit post that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of willingness. To check on his kids' well-being, he talked to his oldest son. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, parents often have the right and responsibility to talk to their children about their family dynamics to ensure their well-being. The author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, not to criticize the girlfriend. He also mentions that the conversation was about both the ex-wife (who's away) and the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems overly dramatic, especially since the author didn't discuss her in a negative light. However, the way he approached it might have been without considering the girlfriend's feelings. Maybe he should have been more transparent or discussed it with her first, but the core issue is about the children's well-being. Since the author's action was in the best interest of his child and he didn't go out of his way to harm the girlfriend's feelings (he even mentions he didn't go to undermine her), it's more about a communication breakdown rather than being in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
