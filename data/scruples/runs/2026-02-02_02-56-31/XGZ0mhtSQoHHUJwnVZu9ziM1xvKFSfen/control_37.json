My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how he perceives the girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author has two kids, 8 and 14. He's living with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. Then, after seeing comments that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm, he talked to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and took offense, thinking he's undermining her. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author argues that he needed to talk to his son about his well-being, not just the girlfriend. He's an adult and should be able to discuss his children's feelings without permission. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, from a parental perspective, talking to your child about their experiences is usually necessary for understanding their well-being. However, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling criticized or not trusted. The key points here are whether the conversation was necessary for the child's welfare and if it was done in a way that respected the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nIn family dynamics, parents often need to discuss their children's perceptions of all family members, including stepparents or partners. However, the method and intent matter. If the author approached the conversation as a way to evaluate the girlfriend's role without considering her feelings, that might be problematic. But if it's about the child's emotional state, it's more about the child's needs.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel disrespected, but the author has a duty to his children. However, communication with the partner is also important. Maybe the author should have discussed this with the girlfriend first to avoid conflict. But the question is whether he was wrong. If the conversation was necessary for the child's sake, then he's not in the wrong. But if it was an invasion of privacy or done in a way that's disrespectful, maybe he is.\n\nReddit often leans towards understanding the parent's need to check in with their kids. The author's intention was to ensure the child isn't hurt, so that's a valid reason. The girlfriend's reaction might be overblown, but the author could have handled it better by discussing it with her first. However, the core issue is the child's well-being, so the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
