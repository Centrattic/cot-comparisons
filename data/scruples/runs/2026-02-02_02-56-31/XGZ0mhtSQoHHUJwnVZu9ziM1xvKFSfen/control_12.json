My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset that he discussed her with their son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context from the previous post. The author asked the girlfriend to pick up the kids from school, which led to conflict. Then, the author talked to his son about how he feels about the girlfriend and his mother being away. The girlfriend took offense, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether talking to one's child about the other parent's partner is inappropriate. Parents often talk to their children to understand their feelings and ensure their well-being. The author's intention was to check in on the kids' adjustment, which seems reasonable. However, the girlfriend felt it was an affront to her authority or presence in the household.\n\nBut, from a parental perspective, having open communication with children is usually important. The author didn't go to the child to criticize the girlfriend; he was concerned about the kids' well-being. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her role isn't respected. However, the author has a right to discuss family matters with his children without needing permission from a partner.\n\nI should also consider if the author's approach was appropriate. Did he frame the conversation correctly? The author mentions the conversation was about both the mother's trip and the girlfriend, so it wasn't one-sided. If the discussion was neutral and aimed at understanding the child's feelings, it's valid. The problem arises if the parent is using the child to mediate or criticize the partner, but the author's intent was to ensure the child's happiness.\n\nIn many cases, when co-parenting with a new partner, boundaries can be tricky. The author might need to have a discussion with the girlfriend about mutual respect and the importance of parent-child communication. However, the act of talking to the child itself isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme if the conversation was meant to be supportive.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's overreaction is more concerning here. The key is that the parent has a responsibility to their children's emotional well-being, which includes open communication. Unless the parent is using the child against the partner in a harmful way, the parent is justified in discussing family matters with their children.\n"
