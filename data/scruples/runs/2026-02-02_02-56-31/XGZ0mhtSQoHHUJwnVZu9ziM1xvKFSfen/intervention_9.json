My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is a father who lives with his girlfriend and two sons. He had a previous issue where his girlfriend was upset about him asking her to pick up their kids from school. Now, he's in a new situation where he talked to his older son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The user is asking if he's in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's intentions. He mentions that he wanted to check in on his son's feelings regarding his mother's absence and his relationship with the girlfriend. He felt it was important to ensure his son wasn't being negatively affected. As a parent, talking to your children about their feelings and family dynamics is generally seen as responsible. The father didn't mention badmouthing the girlfriend; instead, he was trying to understand his son's perspective.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She felt that talking to the son about her undermined her and showed a lack of confidence in her. The key here is whether the father consulted his son about the girlfriend in a way that was private or critical. The user says the conversation was about both the ex-wife and the girlfriend, so it's balanced. But perhaps the girlfriend felt he was gathering opinions about her that could affect their relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the maturity of the son. The son is 14, so he's old enough to have opinions, but how the father approached the conversation matters. If the father encouraged the son to express concerns about the girlfriend, maybe the son shared something negative, which the girlfriend perceived as the father's influence. However, the user states the son was happy with the current situation, so maybe the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nThe father's action of talking to his son is a parental responsibility. However, in a shared household, involving a partner in these family discussions can be tricky. If the girlfriend felt that the conversation was done without her input, maybe she expected more transparency. But the father isn't obligated to clear every conversation with his girlfriend about his children. The balance here is between parental duties and respecting the partner's feelings.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend might have felt blindsided because she wasn't part of the conversation. The father, on the other hand, is doing his duty as a parent. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings are valid in wanting to feel trusted and respected. The father's action might have been well-intentioned, but perhaps the way it was done or the context (previous tension) led to the conflict.\n\nConsidering all points, the father isn't in the wrong for talking to his son. It's a normal part of parenting. The girlfriend's reaction is an issue of communication and trust within their relationship. The father didn't act unreasonably; he addressed his children's well-being, which is his responsibility. The answer should be B (No, he isn't in the wrong).\n"
