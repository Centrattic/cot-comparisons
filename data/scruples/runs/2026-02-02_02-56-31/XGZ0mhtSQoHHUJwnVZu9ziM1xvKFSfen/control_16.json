My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he has two kids, lives with his girlfriend, and he talked to his oldest son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, thinking he undermined her, and now she's reconsidering the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' responsibilities. The author mentions that he was concerned about his kids sensing the girlfriend's lack of willingness to care for them. He had a conversation with his son to check in on his feelings, which he hadn't done before. That seems like a reasonable step as a parent to make sure his child feels supported and safe.\n\nBut then the girlfriend found out and reacted strongly. The key issue here is whether talking to his son about his girlfriend was an overstep. The author argues that he's an adult and needs to be able to talk to his kids without permission. However, the girlfriend felt undermined and betrayed. \n\nOn one hand, parents should be able to discuss their children's well-being with their kids. It's part of being a responsible parent. The author didn't seem to do it to criticize the girlfriend directly but to understand his son's perspective. The conversation was also about his ex-wife's absence, so maybe it's part of a broader discussion about family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect the child's perception of her or create tension. If the author didn't communicate with her first about his intentions, that could have been a misstep. However, the author did mention that the conversation was important for the child's well-being, which is a parent's duty.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense\u2014leaving the house and rethinking the relationship. Her perception is that he lacks confidence in her, which could be a valid concern if the child is influenced by the conversation. But the author's intent was to ensure the child's adjustment, not to undermine her.\n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The author's action was for the child's sake, which is a valid reason. However, maybe he should have discussed this with his girlfriend first to avoid misunderstandings. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't act maliciously and the conversation was necessary for the child's well-being, then he might not be the asshole. The girlfriend's reaction, while strong, could stem from feeling insecure, but the author's actions were in the child's interest. So I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
