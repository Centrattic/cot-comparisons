My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 44-year-old man living with his girlfriend (32F) and his two sons, 8 and 14. The girlfriend lost her job and he supports her, but when he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, she called him an asshole. Then, after some comments on his Reddit post, he sat down with his oldest son to talk about how he felt about the situation, including his mother being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo the key points here: the author had a conversation with his son about his girlfriend and the family situation. The girlfriend reacted strongly, saying he lacks confidence in her and that he betrayed her. The author is wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. \n\nParents often need to talk to their children about various aspects of their lives, including relationships with other adults. It's important for the children's well-being that they feel comfortable discussing family dynamics. The author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which is a responsible parent action. However, the way he approached it might have been problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense. She feels undermined and betrayed. The problem here could be communication. Did the author consider how the girlfriend might feel if their private conversation was about her? Even if the intention was good, the girlfriend might see it as a lack of trust. \n\nBut the author argues that he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids without prior approval. Parents should have autonomy in discussing family matters with their children. However, in a co-parenting or cohabiting situation, especially with a new partner, there might be a need for some discussion to ensure that the children don't feel caught in the middle. \n\nAnother angle: the author's actions could be seen as necessary parenting. If the child is happy, maybe the conversation was appropriate. However, if the girlfriend feels it's a breach of trust, there's a conflict between the parent's duty to the child and the relationship with the partner. \n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on context. If the girlfriend wasn't aware of the importance of the conversation and felt blindsided, maybe the author should have discussed it with her first. However, if the son is the one to talk to, the parent should be able to do so without prior consent from the girlfriend. \n\nBut there's a balance. The girlfriend might need to be part of the child's life, so talking to the child about the girlfriend could affect the dynamics. Maybe the author could have approached it more tactfully, but the act itself might not be wrong. \n\nIn terms of the girlfriend's reaction, her leaving and calling him names might be over-the-top, but her feelings are real. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to check in with his son, but perhaps he could have handled it differently to avoid hurting the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, there's a nuance here. The author's actions are part of parenting, but the way he handled the communication with the girlfriend might need improvement. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the primary responsibility of a parent to their child would suggest that he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is a separate issue, but the author's intent was appropriate.\n"
