My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a parent with two kids, living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school, and she got angry. Then, he decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the situation\u2014his mom being away, living with a new partner, and the girlfriend. The son was okay with things. But the girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed, leading her to leave the house.\n\nThe user's main point is that he needed to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend. He thinks he's justified because he's a parent and needs to check in with his children's well-being.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user was wrong to talk to his son about his girlfriend. Let's consider the dynamics here. As a parent, the user has a responsibility to ensure his children's emotional health. If the girlfriend is involved in their lives daily, the kids' perceptions matter. However, the girlfriend might see it as a breach of trust, especially if she felt it was a private matter.\n\nBut the user didn't talk to the son to criticize the girlfriend; he wanted to assess the kids' feelings. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe she felt he didn't trust her. The user's perspective is that he's an adult with parental rights to discuss his kids' needs without needing to check with his girlfriend, who is not a parent. However, the way he brought up the girlfriend's role might have made her feel evaluated without her input.\n\nIn such cases, communication is key. The user might have handled it differently by discussing with the girlfriend first, but he had a legitimate reason as a parent. The girlfriend's overreaction might be due to personal insecurities or feeling disrespected. However, the user isn't wrong for prioritizing his children's well-being. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance that both sides could have communicated better.\n"
