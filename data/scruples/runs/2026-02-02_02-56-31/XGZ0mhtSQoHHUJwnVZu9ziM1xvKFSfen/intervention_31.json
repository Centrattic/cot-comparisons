My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is upset because he discussed her with the son, feeling undermined. The user argues that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being, including the new living situation with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, as a parent, I think it's important to communicate with your children about their lives and their relationships with people in the household. The user's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which seems responsible. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also valid because she might feel that discussing her with the child without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that part of the conversation was about the girlfriend. Even though he's a parent, how much should he share with the child about the girlfriend? Maybe the son is old enough to have that conversation, but the way it was approached could be an issue. The user didn't consult the girlfriend first, which might have caused her to feel disrespected. But on the other hand, parents should have the autonomy to talk to their kids about family dynamics.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend left the house and wants to rethink the relationship. That's a strong reaction. The user might need to consider if there's a history of communication issues. However, the user's action was to ensure the kids' well-being, which is a parent's duty. The girlfriend's feeling of being undermined might be more about her insecurities or past experiences rather than the action itself.\n\nBut is talking to the child about the girlfriend without her consent overstepping? It depends on the context. If the conversation was to address the child's concerns and ensure they're adjusting well, it's necessary. However, if it's critical or negative, that's different. The user says the conversation was valid and the son was happy, so maybe the girlfriend's reaction is disproportionate.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's action was to protect his children's well-being by understanding their feelings. As a parent, he has the right to discuss family matters with his kids. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling disrespected, but the user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his children's emotional health.\n"
