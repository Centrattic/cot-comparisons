My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully. The user is a 44-year-old man living with his girlfriend and two sons, aged 8 and 14. His girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict because she called him an asshole. Now, after some comments on Reddit suggested that the kids might notice the tension and have negative feelings about the girlfriend, the author decided to talk to his oldest son (the 14-year-old) about how he perceives the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out about this conversation and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, leading her to leave the house to rethink the relationship. The author is now asking if he's the asshole for talking to his son about his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is whether talking to his son about the girlfriend was an overstep. The author's intention was to check in on the kids' well-being, especially considering the previous conflict with the girlfriend and the potential impact on the children. He mentions that the conversation was about both the mother's absence (since the kids' mom is away) and the girlfriend. The girlfriend felt that this conversation undermined her and showed a lack of confidence in her, which is why she's upset.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics here. Parents have a responsibility to ensure their children's emotional well-being. If there's a concern that the kids might be picking up on tension or negative feelings between the parent and the girlfriend, talking to them individually makes sense. However, the way the conversation was approached could affect how it's perceived. The author didn't consult the girlfriend before talking to the child, which might have been a misstep. Even though the parent has a right to talk to his children, doing so without informing the girlfriend could lead to her feeling disrespected or excluded, especially in a relationship where there's already some friction.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. The author is an adult with children and the right to communicate with them about family matters. The conversation was meant to address the kids' perspectives, not to criticize the girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's sensitivity here might indicate that there's existing trust issues or communication problems in the relationship. It's possible that the author didn't consider how the girlfriend would react, which could be a point of contention. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the intention was genuinely to check in on the kids and there's no malicious intent, then perhaps the author isn't the asshole. However, not discussing the conversation with the girlfriend beforehand could be seen as a failure to maintain open communication in the relationship, which is important. So, maybe the author could have handled it differently by involving the girlfriend first to avoid misinterpretation. But was the act of talking to the son inherently wrong? It doesn't seem so. Parents should be able to discuss their family dynamics with their children. The girlfriend's reaction is more about feeling undermined, but the author's intent was to ensure the kids' well-being, not to attack the girlfriend.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author could have improved communication with his girlfriend beforehand, the act of talking to his son about the situation isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be overly harsh given the parent's legitimate concern for his children. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
