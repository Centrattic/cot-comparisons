My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person in the original post is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the father has two kids, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old, and lives with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. Now, the father is concerned about the kids' feelings, so he talked to his older son about how he perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and that he doesn't trust her. She left the house to stay with a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's intentions. He says he wanted to talk to his son about his perceptions regarding the current girlfriend and his mom who's away. The main reason he mentioned talking to the son was to see if the children felt they were being neglected or if they sensed the girlfriend's reluctance. He claims he didn't mean to undermine his girlfriend but was acting in the kids' best interest.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels that by discussing her with the son, he's undermining her authority and lacking trust. She's taking it as a personal betrayal. The father argues that as a parent, he should be able to talk to his children about such matters without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the father overstepped. The key points here are communication, consent, and intent. The father's intention was to check on his children's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. However, discussing a partner in front of the children, especially in a way that could influence their perception, might be sensitive. Even if the father didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend, the way he approached it could be seen as a breach of trust or respect in the relationship.\n\nIn many cases, when there's a step-parent or a new partner involved, it's important to maintain open communication between the parents. The father might have thought he was acting in the kids' best interest, but involving the children in such a discussion without considering the girlfriend's feelings could be problematic. The girlfriend might feel that her role in the family is being evaluated without her input, leading to hurt feelings and a breakdown in trust.\n\nAdditionally, the father's action could be seen as bypassing the girlfriend's authority or input in the household. Even if the conversation was about the kids, talking about the girlfriend in that context without her knowledge could be perceived as a lack of support or respect for her position in the family.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the father's primary responsibility is to his children. Ensuring their emotional well-being is crucial, and seeking their input on family dynamics is part of that. The conflict arises from the method of communication. Perhaps there's a middle ground where the father could have discussed his concerns with the girlfriend first before approaching the children, maintaining transparency and mutual respect.\n\nIn conclusion, while the father's intentions were good, the manner in which he addressed the situation might have been a misstep. He didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend, but the action itself could be seen as a breach of trust in the relationship. Therefore, there's a case to be made that he's in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's perspective beforehand, even if his primary goal was the children's well-being.\n"
