My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they were in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is complex because there are multiple factors at play.\n\nFirst, the user is a parent who wants to ensure their children are okay with the new living situation involving their girlfriend. They had a conversation with their oldest son, which led to the girlfriend being upset because she felt undermined. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, leaving the house and saying she needs to rethink the relationship.\n\nI need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents should check in with their kids about how they're adjusting, especially after major life changes like a parent's absence or a new partner moving in. The user did this to make sure their son wasn't being negatively affected. The conversation wasn't about criticizing the girlfriend but rather understanding the child's perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect the child's opinion of her. However, it's not uncommon for parents to talk to their kids about various aspects of their lives, including relationships. The parent didn't go to the son with intent to undermine the girlfriend but to address the child's well-being.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. The parent's action was part of their parental duty. The girlfriend might need to understand that the parent's priority is the children's well-being. However, communication between the parent and the girlfriend was lacking. Maybe the parent should have discussed their intention to talk to the child with the girlfriend first, but that's not always necessary if the parent's action is in the child's best interest.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's actions were appropriate for ensuring their child's adjustment, so they're not in the wrong. The issue might lie in the girlfriend's insecurity or lack of communication. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
