My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a guy in a relationship with a girlfriend and has two sons. He asked his girlfriend to pick up the kids from school, but she got upset and called him an asshole. Then, after some feedback from Reddit, he talked to his oldest son about how the kid perceives the girlfriend and the situation with the mother. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, feeling undermined. The guy is asking if he's in the wrong here.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was appropriate. The user's argument is that he needed to check in with his child about how the current arrangements were affecting him, and that he should be able to talk to his kids without his girlfriend's permission. The girlfriend feels that this conversation was a betrayal and a lack of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is a parent, so his responsibility is to his children. If there's a concern that the kids might be affected by the living arrangements or the girlfriend's role, talking to them directly makes sense. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, maybe feeling that he didn't trust her with the kids or in the relationship. But is the user wrong for wanting to ensure his child's well-being?\n\nFrom a parenting standpoint, it's important to communicate with children to understand their feelings. The user's intention wasn't to undermine the girlfriend but to check in with his son. However, the girlfriend's perspective is valid too\u2014maybe she felt that discussing her with the child without her knowledge could affect the child's view of her. But the user is not the one to clear such conversations with the girlfriend; parents need to talk to their kids directly.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her role in the family isn't respected. But the user's action was a responsible step as a parent. The key is intent versus impact. The user's intent was to ensure his child's happiness, which is a parent's duty. The impact upset the girlfriend, but that doesn't necessarily make the user wrong. It might mean that he needs to handle communication more sensitively, but the act itself was not wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong). The user acted in his children's best interest, which is his role as a parent. However, there might be room for better communication between him and his girlfriend to address her feelings, but that doesn't mean he was wrong for talking to his son.\n"
