My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation step by step. The user is a father who lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict where she called him an asshole. Then, he had a conversation with his older son about how he feels about his parents and the new girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined.\n\nSo the main question is whether the user is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The user's reasoning is that he needed to check in with his kids about their well-being, especially since the girlfriend's behavior might have been affecting them. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels her boundaries were crossed.\n\nFrom a parental standpoint, it's important to ensure the kids' emotional well-being. Discussing family dynamics with children to understand their feelings is a responsible action. However, the way the conversation was initiated might have caused the girlfriend to feel disrespected. The user didn't consult the girlfriend before talking to the child, which could be a breach of trust in their relationship.\n\nBut the user also has a responsibility to his children. If the girlfriend is acting in a way that could be harmful to the kids, the father should address it. However, the approach should ideally include communication with the girlfriend to avoid making her feel targeted. \n\nIn relationships, especially co-parenting ones, communication and mutual respect are key. The user might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect his children, but the method could have been better handled by discussing his concerns with the girlfriend first. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but her feelings of being undermined are valid if she wasn't consulted. \n\nSo, the balance here is between the father's duty to his children and respecting the girlfriend's role. The father's action was well-intentioned but perhaps executed without enough consideration for the girlfriend's feelings, which could be seen as a mistake. Therefore, he might be partially at fault, but not entirely. However, given that the girlfriend's reaction was overblown, the user's intentions were good, so maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
