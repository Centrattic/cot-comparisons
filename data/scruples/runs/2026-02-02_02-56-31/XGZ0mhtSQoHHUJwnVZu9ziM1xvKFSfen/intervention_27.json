My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user has two sons, aged 8 and 14. The older son, 14, had a conversation with the dad about the girlfriend and how he sees her. The dad wanted to check in on the kids' feelings, especially because the girlfriend was upset when she found out. The girlfriend felt undermined and left the house, saying the dad didn't have confidence in her.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was wrong. The dad's intention was to make sure the kids were okay, not to undermine the girlfriend. But the girlfriend took it as a personal attack.\n\nNow, considering the parent's role: parents have a responsibility to communicate with their children, especially about their well-being and relationships. The dad had valid concerns from previous comments about the kids sensing tension. He did it to check on their adjustment, not to criticize the girlfriend. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the dad should have considered how the girlfriend would feel. However, in a relationship, especially with step-parents, there's a balance. The father's children's emotional state is crucial, and he's not in the wrong for wanting to ensure they're okay. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving the house and calling him immature might indicate she's overreacting.\n\nBut is there any fault on the dad's side? He didn't discuss the girlfriend's behavior in a way that's negative, just asked the son his opinion. The son was positive, so the dad's approach was likely appropriate. The girlfriend's insecurity might be an issue here. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the dad was acting in the children's best interest, not undermining the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own insecurities or how she interprets the conversation. Therefore, the dad isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
