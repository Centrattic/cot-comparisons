My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a father with two boys, living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. Then, he sat down with his 14-year-old son to talk about how the son feels about the situation, including his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, the main question is whether talking to his son about the girlfriend was wrong. The author's intention was to check in on his son's well-being and see if he's adjusting okay, especially since the mother is away and the girlfriend is now part of the household. The girlfriend feels he didn't have confidence in her, hence the reaction.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Parental responsibility vs. partner's feelings. As a parent, it's generally considered important to communicate with your children about their lives, including significant adults in their lives. The author's action seems justified if the intent was to ensure his son's emotional state and adjust accordingly. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also valid because she might feel that discussing her in this context without her knowledge could be seen as a lack of trust.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. From a parenting perspective, talking to your child about their feelings towards a caregiver (even a partner) is reasonable. It's part of monitoring the child's adjustment. However, the way he approached it and whether he considered how his girlfriend might feel could matter. The author mentions he didn't go to undermine her; the conversation was about both the mother's absence and the girlfriend. But the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected.\n\nIn such cases, communication is key. If the author had discussed his concerns with his girlfriend first or found a way that respects her feelings while still checking in with his son, that might have been better. But the act itself of talking to his son isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's overreaction might stem from insecurity or feeling disrespected, but the parent's duty is to the child's well-being.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), because as a parent, he has a right and responsibility to check in with his children about their perceptions, especially regarding caregivers. The girlfriend's reaction, while hurtful, might be her issue with how the conversation was framed rather than the act itself. The author's intent was to ensure his son's well-being, which is a parent's priority.\n"
