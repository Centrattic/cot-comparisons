My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves his girlfriend getting upset, feeling undermined, and leaving the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. The user wanted to check how their son was feeling about the living arrangements and the girlfriend. The son was happy, and the parent felt it was important to talk to their kids about their well-being. That seems reasonable.\n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is strong. She felt undermined and betrayed. The key here is whether the parent's conversation was meant to be critical of the girlfriend. The user says it wasn't, but the girlfriend perceived it that way. \n\nThe user's right to talk to their children about their lives is important. Parents need to communicate with their kids about family dynamics. However, the manner in which it was done might have been an issue. Did the parent discuss the conversation with the girlfriend first? Maybe not, which could have caused the misunderstanding.\n\nAlso, the context is a high-stress environment with a new job loss and a live-in partner. The girlfriend might be feeling insecure or stressed, leading her to react more intensely. The parent might need to have a conversation with the girlfriend to explain their intentions, rather than just talking to the son and then being surprised by the reaction.\n\nBut the parent isn't wrong for wanting to know their child's feelings. However, the approach might have lacked consideration for the girlfriend's perspective. Maybe there's a middle ground where the parent could have discussed the topic with the girlfriend first or explained the conversation afterward to avoid perceived undermining.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the parent had a legitimate reason to talk to their child. But there's room for improvement in communication with the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but the parent could have handled it differently to avoid conflict.\n"
