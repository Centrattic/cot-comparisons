My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset and left, feeling undermined. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has two kids and a girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job and the author asked her to pick up the kids and watch them, which led to conflict. Now, he's concerned about how the kids perceive the situation and how they see his girlfriend. He decides to talk to his 14-year-old son about this, which the girlfriend found out and was upset about.\n\nThe main issue here is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was appropriate. The author's intention was to check in on the kids' well-being, making sure they aren't being negatively affected by the situation. However, the girlfriend felt that this conversation was a betrayal and a lack of trust in her. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, parents do need to talk to their children about family matters to ensure their children's emotional health. It's important for the author to understand how his children view their new living situation and the role of the girlfriend. The conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about the mother being away. So, the author's intent wasn't to undermine the girlfriend but to address the children's feelings.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected or that her position in the family was being questioned. Maybe she felt that discussing her with the child without her input was a breach of trust. In relationships, communication and boundaries are key. If the author had discussed this with the girlfriend first, it might have prevented the conflict. But since he didn't, she might feel he didn't consider her feelings.\n\nBut then again, the author is the parent, and he has a responsibility to his children. The son is 14, an age where they can have meaningful conversations. The author didn't share the content of the conversation with the girlfriend, which could have caused her to misinterpret his intentions. If the conversation was respectful and aimed at the child's well-being, the author might not be in the wrong. However, not discussing it with the girlfriend could have been a misstep, even if the intention was good.\n\nSo, the question is whether talking to the child about the girlfriend without the girlfriend's knowledge was a breach of trust. If the author didn't have malicious intent and was genuinely concerned about the child's well-being, then it could be justified. But the girlfriend's strong reaction indicates she felt it was a personal attack. In healthy relationships, partners should be able to discuss family matters, but it's important to consider the other person's feelings and communicate openly.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might not be wrong from a parental duty standpoint, but he could have handled the situation better by involving the girlfriend in the discussion. However, since he had a valid reason and the conversation was about the child's well-being, he might not be the asshole. So, the answer is B.\n"
