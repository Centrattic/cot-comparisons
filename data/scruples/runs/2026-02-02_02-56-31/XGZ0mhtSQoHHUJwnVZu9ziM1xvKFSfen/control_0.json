My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after talking to his son about his girlfriend. The author's situation involves his kids, his ex-wife, and his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author had a previous post where he was criticized for asking his girlfriend to pick up the kids. Now, he's talking to his oldest son about how the son perceives the girlfriend and his mother. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. \n\nThe key points here: The author's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, considering the previous feedback about the kids sensing the girlfriend's reluctance. He wanted to ensure his children were okay. However, the girlfriend took it as a personal attack. \n\nIs the author wrong for talking to his son? Well, as a parent, having open conversations with children about family dynamics is generally seen as responsible. The author didn't go to undermine the girlfriend; he was addressing his kids' emotional state. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, especially since she wasn't consulted beforehand. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did he approach the conversation in a way that could be seen as critical? The user mentions the conversation was as much about the mother's absence as the girlfriend. If the son felt comfortable sharing, that's good. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect their relationship. \n\nBut the main issue is the author's right to communicate with his children. He's the parent, so he should be able to talk to his kids without needing permission. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about feeling disrespected rather than the act itself being wrong. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
