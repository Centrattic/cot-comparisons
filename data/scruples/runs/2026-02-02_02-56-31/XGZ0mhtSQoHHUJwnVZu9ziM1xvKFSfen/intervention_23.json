My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. From the story, the parent had a conversation with their oldest son to check in on how he's handling the new living situation with the girlfriend and the mom being away. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intention. They mentioned that they wanted to make sure their kids were okay, especially after comments on the previous Reddit post suggested the kids might sense tension. They also said the conversation was about both the son's mom being away and the girlfriend. So the parent's main goal seems to be the children's well-being, which is a valid concern.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She thinks the parent lacks confidence in her and that the conversation undermined her. The parent feels they should be able to talk to their kids without needing permission. But here's the thing: when discussing a partner in front of the children, especially in a way that might reflect on their role in the household, it can be sensitive. The parent might have thought it was just a private family conversation, but the girlfriend could see it as a breach of trust or as potentially affecting the kids' perception of her.\n\nI should think about boundaries in relationships. Even though the parent is the child's parent, involving the children in discussions about the partner could be seen as crossing a line. The girlfriend's feeling of betrayal might stem from not being consulted or included in such a conversation. The parent might not have realized the impact of discussing the girlfriend's role in front of the child, which could affect the child's view of the step-parent and the dynamics between the parent and partner.\n\nAlso, the parent mentioned that they had a valid reason\u2014checking on the kids' well-being\u2014but maybe there's a way to do that without involving the girlfriend's role so directly. It's possible that the parent didn't consider how the girlfriend would feel about being discussed in that context. The girlfriend's reaction, while maybe over the top, isn't entirely unfounded because when partners discuss each other with the kids, it can create tension or insecurity, especially if the partner isn't part of the conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent does have the right to talk to their kids about family matters. However, the way the conversation was framed\u2014focusing on the girlfriend's role\u2014might have been perceived as critical or as questioning her capability. The parent might need to communicate better with their partner about such discussions in the future, perhaps involving the girlfriend in the conversation with the child if possible, or at least explaining the reason behind the talk to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong because their intention was the kids' well-being. However, they could have been more mindful of the girlfriend's feelings and maybe approached the situation differently. It's a gray area, but since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer might lean towards not being the asshole (B), but with the caveat that there's room for better communication and consideration of the partner's feelings.\n"
