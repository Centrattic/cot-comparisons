My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by talking to his son about his girlfriend. The situation involves a couple living together with two kids. The author's girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids, which led to tension. Then, he sat down with his older son to discuss how the son felt about the new living arrangements and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The father's intention was to check in with his son about his well-being and how he perceives the new family dynamics. That seems like a responsible parent action. Parents often talk to their kids about various aspects of their lives, including other family members, to ensure the kids are adjusting well. It's part of being a parent to address any potential issues early.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. She feels betrayed and undermined, which suggests that there might be trust issues or communication problems in their relationship. The author didn't consult her before talking to the son, which could be a point of contention. But is that consultation necessary? If the children's well-being is at stake, parents have a right to discuss things with their kids without needing permission from their partner. It's their child, after all.\n\nThe key here is the intent versus the effect. The author's intent was to ensure his son's adjustment, but the girlfriend felt targeted. The question is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend's role without her consent. However, in many cases, parents do talk to their children about other adults in the family, including partners. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her role as a step-parent is being questioned.\n\nAnother angle: the father didn't just talk about the girlfriend but also about the son's mother being away. So it's a broader discussion about family dynamics. The girlfriend's sensitivity might be because she feels her position in the family is precarious. The father's actions, while not malicious, might have triggered her insecurities. But is that the father's fault? If he's being a responsible parent, then maybe not. However, maybe there's a need for better communication between the two adults to prevent such misunderstandings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father's action doesn't seem inherently wrong. He's acting in his child's best interest. The girlfriend's reaction points to deeper issues in their relationship, perhaps a lack of trust or communication. The father might need to address how he approaches future conversations with his partner to avoid similar conflicts, but the act of talking to his child isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to ensure that there's no cultural or situational nuance I'm missing. For example, if there were prior agreements about not discussing the girlfriend in front of the kids, that could change things. But based on the given info, the father's action seems justified.\n"
