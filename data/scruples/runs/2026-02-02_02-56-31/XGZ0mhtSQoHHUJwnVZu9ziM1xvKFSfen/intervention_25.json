My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, thinking he undermined her. The user's main point is that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being, especially since the girlfriend was now living with them and the kids had been with their mother before. He wanted to make sure the kids were adjusting okay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is a parent, so his primary responsibility is to his children. He's trying to check in on their feelings, which seems like a responsible action. But the girlfriend felt betrayed, maybe because he discussed her with the kids without her knowledge. But is that reasonable? \n\nIn a co-parenting situation, especially when there's a new partner involved, communication is key. The user might have assumed that discussing the kids' feelings with them is necessary, but maybe he should have also included the girlfriend in that conversation. However, the kids are his children, so he has the right to talk to them about their family dynamics. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems intense. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship. That's a big response. Maybe she felt her authority or role as a step-parent was being questioned. But is it reasonable for her to feel undermined? If the conversation was about the kids' feelings and included other topics like the mother being away, maybe she's feeling insecure or not trusted. \n\nBut is the user wrong for talking to his own kids? Generally, parents should be able to discuss family matters with their children. The problem might be that the girlfriend wasn't part of that discussion, leading to her feeling excluded. However, the user's intention was to ensure the children's well-being, not to criticize the girlfriend. \n\nThe key points are: Did he overstep by talking to the kids about the girlfriend? Or is it his right as a parent to check in with his children about their family situation? The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her own insecurities or communication issues in the relationship rather than the act itself. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the user is not in the wrong. He's acting in his children's best interest. The girlfriend might need to work on her reaction and communication. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he is not in the wrong).\n"
