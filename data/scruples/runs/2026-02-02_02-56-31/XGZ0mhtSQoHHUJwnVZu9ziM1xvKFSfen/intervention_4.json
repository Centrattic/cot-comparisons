My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. They live together with their kids and girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job and was asked to pick up the kids, which led to some conflict. Then the parent talked to their oldest son about how he feels regarding the girlfriend and his mom being away. The girlfriend took offense and left, saying the parent undermined her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They wanted to check in with their son about his feelings, which is a responsible thing to do when there are changes in the household. The parent mentions that the conversation was also about the son's mother being away, so it wasn't solely about the girlfriend. That seems reasonable.\n\nBut the girlfriend felt undermined. So, the parent didn't ask for permission, which might be an issue. However, parents should be able to talk to their kids without needing permission from a partner, especially on matters related to the children's well-being. The parent's intention was to ensure the kids aren't hurt, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems over-the-top. If she felt the conversation was about her, maybe she's sensitive about her role in the family. But the parent did have a right to discuss with their son how he's adjusting to the new living situation. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parent could have been more considerate in how they approached the conversation, but there's no indication they were critical. The son was happy with the situation, so the parent's action was probably in the child's best interest.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They acted in their child's best interest and didn't do anything that would be considered undermining the girlfriend if the conversation was open and honest. The girlfriend's overreaction might stem from insecurity or feeling threatened, but that doesn't make the parent wrong.\n"
