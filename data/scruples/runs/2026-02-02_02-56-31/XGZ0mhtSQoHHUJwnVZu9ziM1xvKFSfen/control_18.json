My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, thinking he undermined her. The author says he needed to talk to the kids about their mom being away and the girlfriend, to ensure the kids are okay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two kids and a girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job, and he's supporting her financially. He asked her to pick up the kids a couple of days, which led to a conflict. Now, he's talking to his son about how the son feels about the girlfriend and the arrangement. The girlfriend's reaction is that he doesn't have confidence in her, leading her to leave.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, as a parent, checking in with the kids about their feelings is important. The author did this to ensure the kids' well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. However, maybe he didn't inform his girlfriend first. But does that make him wrong? The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014calling it a betrayal and comparing him to a 6-year-old. It's possible she felt insecure or threatened by the conversation. But the author's intention was to prioritize his children's emotional health, which is valid. \n\nThe key points: Parenting responsibilities vs. partner's feelings. The author acted in the kids' best interest, but perhaps the way he approached it upset his girlfriend. However, he's not wrong for wanting to talk to his kids. The girlfriend should be able to handle such conversations without feeling undermined. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
