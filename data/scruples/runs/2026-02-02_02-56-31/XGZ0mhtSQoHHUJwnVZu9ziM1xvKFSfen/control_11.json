My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is a parent living with his girlfriend and their two kids. The girlfriend lost her job and was asked to help with the kids, which led to conflict. The author then talked to his son about his feelings towards the girlfriend and his mom. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author feels he's not in the wrong because he needed to talk to his kids without his girlfriend's permission.\n\nSo, the key points here are about parental rights versus the girlfriend's feelings. The author's intention was to understand his son's perspective regarding his mom's absence and the girlfriend's role. The question is whether discussing this with the child, without the girlfriend's knowledge, was wrong.\n\nFrom a parenting standpoint, it's reasonable for a parent to talk to their children about family dynamics, especially regarding their well-being. The author's conversation was about the children's perceptions and their feelings about both parents and the new partner. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling attacked or not trusted. However, as an adult, the author has the right to communicate with his children about family matters, which is part of responsible parenting.\n\nBut, the way the conversation was handled might have been a factor. If the author intended to use the child's opinions to criticize the girlfriend, that could be problematic. However, the author states the conversation was balanced, discussing both the girlfriend and the ex-wife. The girlfriend's overreaction (leaving the house, threatening to break up) might indicate her own insecurities or lack of trust in the relationship, not necessarily the author's wrongdoing.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have handled it differently by discussing with the girlfriend first, but the necessity to talk to the child directly because of the child's well-being is valid. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate unless there were prior agreements or boundaries about discussing her with the children. Without such prior agreements, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his children's emotional health.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's a parent addressing his children's emotional well-being, which takes precedence over the girlfriend's feelings in this context unless there's a prior agreement to the contrary.\n"
