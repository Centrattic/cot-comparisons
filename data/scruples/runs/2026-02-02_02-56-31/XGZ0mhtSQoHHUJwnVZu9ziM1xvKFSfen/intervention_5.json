My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives the user's girlfriend. The situation is that the user lives with their girlfriend and their two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and was asked to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her being upset. Then the user had a conversation with their oldest son (14 years old) about how he feels about his mother being away and about the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The user is wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's intentions. The user mentioned that they had the conversation because people had commented on the previous situation that the kids might sense the girlfriend's resentment. The user wanted to check in with their son to see how he's coping, which seems like a responsible action as a parent. They also mention that the conversation was not to undermine the girlfriend but to ensure the child's well-being. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she felt betrayed and left the house. The user and girlfriend are adults, so there's an expectation of mutual respect and communication. The user didn't consult the girlfriend before talking to the son. Even though the user's intent was good, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child without her knowledge could affect their relationship or how the child views her. \n\nIn some cases, partners might expect that discussing the other partner in front of the children, especially in a context that could be perceived as evaluating their role, requires some level of communication with the other partner. The user's girlfriend might feel that her privacy or the dynamics of her relationship with the children are being interfered with without her input.\n\nOn the flip side, the user is a parent, and talking to their children about family dynamics is part of parenting. The user might not have realized that the girlfriend would take it personally. The key here is whether the user's actions were appropriate given the circumstances. \n\nThe user did not ask the son for criticism of the girlfriend but rather to assess how he's feeling. However, the fact that the girlfriend found out and took it as a personal attack suggests that the user didn't consider her feelings enough. The user is an adult, but so is the girlfriend. The user might need to have a conversation with the girlfriend to explain the intent and ensure that future discussions with the children include mutual understanding.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the user's intent was purely to check on the child's well-being and they didn't go into the conversation with the intent to undermine, then they might not be in the wrong. However, the way it was done without considering the girlfriend's feelings could be seen as a misstep. The user didn't wrong the son, but possibly the girlfriend. Since the question is about being the asshole in the context of the girlfriend's reaction, the answer might hinge on the user's approach. If they didn't consult her and went ahead, maybe they did overstep, even if unintentionally.\n\nAlternatively, the user isn't wrong for talking to their own child about family matters. Parents need to communicate with their children. The girlfriend might need to handle her reaction better. But since the user is asking if they're the asshole, and the girlfriend is upset, the answer might be B (not wrong) because the user's action was part of parenting. However, there's a need for better communication between the partners. The user might not be the asshole but could have handled it differently.\n"
