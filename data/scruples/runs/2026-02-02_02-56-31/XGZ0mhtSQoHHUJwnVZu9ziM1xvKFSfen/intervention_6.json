My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dad who talked to his son about how the son feels about his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset and left, feeling undermined. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's intentions. He mentioned he talked to his son because others had suggested that the kids might notice the girlfriend not being fully engaged. He wanted to check how the kids felt, which seems like a responsible thing to do as a parent. The conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about the son's other parent being away. So, his main goal was probably to ensure his kids are okay, not to criticize the girlfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt her relationship with the dad was being undermined. She might see the conversation as a lack of trust in her ability to bond with the kids. In relationships, especially when there are children involved, trust and communication are crucial. The dad didn't check with the girlfriend before talking to the child, which could be seen as a breach of trust from her perspective.\n\nBut then again, the dad is the parent, so he has a duty to communicate with his children about their well-being. It's part of his role. However, the way he approached it might have been sensitive. Maybe he should have discussed with the girlfriend first about his concerns regarding the kids' perceptions. But the dad argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without needing permission. That makes sense because parents do need autonomy in parenting decisions.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings are valid. She might feel insecure or not respected if the dad is discussing her with the children without her input. It could be seen as undermining her authority or presence in the household. However, the dad's intention was to check on the kids' feelings, not to criticize her. The key here is whether the dad's actions were considerate of the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. The dad didn't inform the girlfriend beforehand, which might have caused unnecessary hurt. Even if the intent was good, the method could have been smoother. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend first about the plan to discuss with the kids, to align expectations.\n\nBut considering that the dad's primary responsibility is to his children, it's reasonable for him to want to understand their feelings. The girlfriend's reaction, while hurtful, might be an overreaction. The dad isn't in the wrong for wanting to know his children's thoughts, but he could have handled it in a way that includes the girlfriend more, perhaps.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: Is the dad in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the dad had discussed with the girlfriend first, maybe the situation wouldn't have escalated. But given that he's the parent, he has a right to communicate with his children. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but she's entitled to feel hurt. However, the dad's action was for the kids' well-being, which is a valid reason. \n\nGiven that the dad's intention was not malicious and he's acting in his children's best interest, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. But if the lack of communication with his girlfriend was a misstep, then maybe he's partially at fault. The question is whether the act of talking to the son inherently makes him wrong. Since the primary responsibility is to the kids, I think he's not in the wrong, but could have handled it better. So the answer is B.\n"
