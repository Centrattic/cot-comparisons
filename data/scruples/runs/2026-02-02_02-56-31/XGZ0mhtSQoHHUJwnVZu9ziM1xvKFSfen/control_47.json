My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a father living with his girlfriend and his two sons. His girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week. She was upset and called him an asshole. Then, the author had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about how he felt about the girlfriend and the situation. The girlfriend found out and got really angry, accusing the author of undermining her and lacking confidence in her. She left the house and said she needs to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. As a parent, he has a responsibility to check in with his children about their well-being and how they feel about the people in their lives, especially since they've been through a major change (their mother being away and the new living arrangement with the girlfriend). The author's intention was to ensure his son was okay, which is a parent's duty. However, the girlfriend took offense because she felt he didn't trust her. \n\nNow, is it wrong for the author to talk to his son? On one hand, parents should be able to discuss their children's feelings without needing permission from a partner. The children's well-being is a priority. On the other hand, maybe the author should have considered how the girlfriend might feel and perhaps discussed it with her first, but the main concern is the kids. \n\nThe author's actions were for the children's benefit, not to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, possibly due to insecurity or feeling disrespected. The author's main goal was to ensure his son was happy, which is a valid reason. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her own feelings than the action itself. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. He was acting in his children's best interest, which is a parent's responsibility.\n"
