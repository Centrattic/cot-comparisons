My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a father who lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict where she called him an asshole. Now, he talked to his oldest son about how the kid felt regarding the girlfriend and their mom being away. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. The key points here are his intention to check in with his son about the family dynamics, which he did for the son's well-being. However, the girlfriend perceived this as a lack of trust and confidence in her. The user argues he needs to talk to his kids without needing her approval.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, ensuring the child's feelings are addressed is important. But the way the conversation was handled might have caused the girlfriend to feel disrespected. The user didn't consult her before talking to the child, which can be seen as a breach of trust in a relationship. However, the user's main concern was the child's well-being, and parents should have the right to discuss family matters with their children without interference from the partner, unless there's a prior agreement.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense, comparing the situation to high school drama, but her feeling of betrayal is valid if she believed the conversation was a criticism of her. However, the user's intent was to ensure the child's adjustment, not to undermine the girlfriend. It's a balance between parental responsibility and relationship communication. The user might not be in the wrong for prioritizing his child's needs, but perhaps could have handled it more sensitively by involving the girlfriend in the discussion first.\n"
