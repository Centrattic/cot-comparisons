My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the boy perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves a co-parenting arrangement with an ex-wife and a current girlfriend. The key points are:\n\n1. The user sat down with their 14-year-old son to discuss how he views the girlfriend and his mother's absence. The son was happy with the arrangement.\n2. The girlfriend found out and felt undermined, leading her to leave the house temporarily. She accused the user of lacking confidence in her and being immature.\n3. The user argues that they needed to talk to their son without needing permission, as they're responsible for their children.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether discussing the girlfriend's role with the son was appropriate without the girlfriend's consent. The user's intention was to check in on their child's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the girlfriend felt her feelings were disregarded, possibly because the conversation might have made the son question her role or caused her insecurity. \n\nIn many cases, when co-parenting or in blended families, communication is key. However, involving a child in discussions about a parent's partner can sometimes lead to unintended consequences, like the child feeling they have to judge or compare the adults' relationships. The user's action was to ensure their son was adjusting well, which is valid. But the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt her position was being scrutinized, which is understandable if she's in a delicate position with the children and the ex-wife situation.\n\nThe user's perspective is that they needed to talk to their son without the girlfriend's permission, which is a parent's right. However, in a relationship, transparency and mutual respect are important. Even though the parent has the right to speak with their child, the girlfriend might expect some level of consultation, especially if she's involved in the children's daily lives. The user didn't mention discussing the conversation with the girlfriend beforehand, which could have prevented the misunderstanding.\n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to ensure their son's well-being, but they could have handled the situation more sensitively by involving the girlfriend in the discussion, explaining their intentions, and perhaps reassuring her about their trust in her. The girlfriend's reaction, while perhaps over the top, is a valid response to feeling undermined. Therefore, the user's actions were well-intentioned but could have been more considerate of the girlfriend's feelings, leading to a mix of right and wrong. However, since the user's primary responsibility is to their children, and they had a legitimate reason to talk to their son, the answer leans towards \"Not the Asshole.\"\n"
