My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids, which led to conflict. Now, he's concerned about the kids' well-being and had a conversation with his oldest son about how he feels about the current living situation and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parent's duty to talk to his child about family dynamics and the girlfriend's reaction. The parent is trying to understand his child's feelings, which is a normal part of parenting. However, the girlfriend feels that this conversation was a personal critique of her. \n\nI need to consider if the parent overstepped. Did he approach the conversation in a way that was fair? The user says the conversation was just as much about the mother's absence as about the girlfriend. So maybe the parent's intention was to assess the child's adjustment, which is valid. But the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt targeted. \n\nIs it the parent's right to discuss this with his child? As a parent, he has a responsibility to check in with his kids about their feelings, especially during significant changes like a new living arrangement. However, the timing and manner might matter. If he didn't inform the girlfriend first, that could be a point of contention. But parents often talk to their kids without consulting partners about every detail. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving the house and rethinking the relationship. Maybe she's sensitive about being judged, especially since there was prior conflict about her helping with the kids. The parent might have failed to consider her feelings, but the parent's main concern was the child's well-being. \n\nIs the parent the asshole? It's a balance between parental responsibility and respecting the partner's feelings. The parent's action was reasonable, but maybe he should have handled it more delicately. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems overblown. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the parent was doing his job as a parent to ensure his child is okay. The girlfriend's response is more dramatic and possibly unreasonable.\n"
