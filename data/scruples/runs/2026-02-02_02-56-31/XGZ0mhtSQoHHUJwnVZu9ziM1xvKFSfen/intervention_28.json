My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The key points here are the situation's context and the reactions involved.\n\nFirst, the user has two sons, 8 and 14. They live with their girlfriend and her recent job loss has led to her taking on more responsibilities, like picking up the kids. The previous Reddit post mentioned a conflict where the girlfriend called him an asshole after he asked her to help. Now, after feedback from Reddit, the user decided to talk to their oldest son (14) about how he feels regarding the new living situation and the girlfriend. The son was happy, but the girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe user's main action is talking to their son without the girlfriend's knowledge. The question is whether this action was wrong. The user argues that as a parent, they should be able to talk to their children about family matters, including the new partner. The girlfriend feels her position is being attacked, leading to her leaving the house.\n\nTo determine if the user is in the wrong (Answer A) or not (Answer B), we need to consider typical family dynamics. Parents have a responsibility to check in with their children's well-being, which includes understanding how they perceive new family members. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without her input could affect her relationship with the child or the child's perception of her. \n\nThe user's intent was to ensure their son's well-being and address any potential issues, which is a valid parental concern. However, the method might have been problematic. Did the user discuss the conversation with the girlfriend beforehand? If not, it could be seen as a breach of trust or respect, even if the intention was good. \n\nIn many relationships, discussing a partner's role in the children's lives can be sensitive. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might feel that the conversation was a criticism of her parenting abilities or her relationship with the child. The user might not have considered that perspective, even if their intention was purely to assess the son's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's right to communicate with their child is important. Parents need to be informed about their children's lives, and discussing a new family member is part of that. The key issue might be the lack of communication between the user and the girlfriend before having the conversation. If the user had discussed this with the girlfriend, perhaps they could have approached it together, which might have avoided the conflict.\n\nSo, the user's action might not be wrong in intent, but the execution\u2014without discussing with the girlfriend first\u2014could be seen as a misstep. However, the core action (talking to the child) is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction might be disproportionate, but the user could have handled the situation better by involving the girlfriend beforehand. \n\nGiven that, the answer could hinge on whether the user's action breached trust despite being a parental duty. If the girlfriend felt it was done to undermine her, but the user's intent was not, then the user isn't necessarily the asshole. However, the method could be improved. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because checking in with the child is a parent's right and responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction is problematic, but the user isn't wrong for doing their duty as a parent.\n"
