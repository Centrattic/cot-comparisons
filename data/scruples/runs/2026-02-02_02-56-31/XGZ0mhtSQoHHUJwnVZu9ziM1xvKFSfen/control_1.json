My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is a father of two living with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which she resented. He then talked to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the new living arrangements and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, thinking he undermined her and lacks confidence in her.\n\nSo, the key points here are the father's right to discuss his children's feelings with them versus respecting the girlfriend's boundaries. The father argues that talking to his son is part of being a parent, especially since the children are his responsibility. The girlfriend feels betrayed because he discussed her without consulting her first.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's reasonable for a parent to check in with their child about their emotional well-being, especially when there are changes in family dynamics. The father's intention was to ensure the child wasn't being negatively affected by the new living situation. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt her autonomy and relationship with the children was being questioned. \n\nThe question is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend directly. In many cases, parents do talk to their children about various aspects of their family, including stepparents or partners. However, if the father had discussed the child's feelings without directly criticizing the girlfriend, it might have been smoother. The problem might be more about the father's approach rather than the act itself. But the father insists the conversation was balanced between the ex-wife and the girlfriend.\n\nConsidering all this, the father's action seems justified as part of his parental duty. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but that doesn't necessarily mean the father is wrong. The father wasn't spying on the girlfriend or badmouthing her, just discussing the child's perceptions. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
