My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves a live-in girlfriend who's been supportive, but there's tension because she felt her privacy was invaded when he discussed her with his child.\n\nFirst, the user's intent was to check in on his son's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The son was happy with the arrangement, so the conversation wasn't negative. However, the girlfriend felt undermined and betrayed. The key here is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend crosses a boundary.\n\nParents have a right to know how their children feel about their family dynamics. The user didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to understand his feelings. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her perception matters in their relationship. The user might not be wrong for wanting to ensure his son's happiness, but he should consider how his actions affect the girlfriend's feelings. It's a balance between parental duty and respecting the partner's feelings. \n\nSince the user's primary responsibility is to his children, and he didn't act with malice, the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong). However, communication between the user and girlfriend is needed to address her feelings. The key is that discussing the child's perception isn't inherently wrong, especially for a parent's duty.\n"
