My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The user is a dad who lives with his girlfriend and his two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he's been supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, but she got really upset and called him an asshole. Then, the dad talked to his oldest son about how the kid perceives the girlfriend and the situation with his mom. The girlfriend found out and is now furious, feeling undermined and betrayed. The dad is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's intentions. He wanted to check in with his son about how he feels regarding the new living arrangement with his girlfriend and his mom being away. As a parent, making sure the kids are okay is important. The dad might think it's necessary to talk to his kids about their feelings without needing permission from his girlfriend. After all, the kids are his responsibility, and their well-being is crucial.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she feels the dad doesn't trust her. She might see the conversation as a criticism of her role as a caregiver, especially since she was already stressed about losing her job. The dad's action could be perceived as a lack of confidence in her ability to care for the kids, which might hurt her feelings. But the dad argues that the conversation was also about the son's mother's trip and not solely about the girlfriend.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here: the dad is trying to ensure his son's emotional well-being. The girlfriend might feel that discussing her in a conversation with the child without her input could make the child feel conflicted or that the girlfriend isn't fully part of the family. However, the dad is an adult with the right to talk to his children about family matters. The key here is whether the conversation was done in a way that was respectful and appropriate.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. Leaving the house and saying she needs to rethink the relationship over a conversation between a parent and child about family dynamics might be an overreaction. However, if the dad didn't check with her first, it could be seen as dismissive of her feelings, even if his intentions were good. But since the kids are his, he has a right to discuss their welfare without needing her approval. \n\nIn many cases, parents need to have private conversations with their children about various family members, including stepparents or partners. It's part of understanding the child's perspective. The girlfriend's insecurity might be playing a role here, especially if she's feeling uncertain about her role in the family. But the dad isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his son's emotional health. It's a parent's duty to ensure their children feel comfortable and supported.\n\nSo, the dad's action was appropriate. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own insecurities rather than the dad being an asshole. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
