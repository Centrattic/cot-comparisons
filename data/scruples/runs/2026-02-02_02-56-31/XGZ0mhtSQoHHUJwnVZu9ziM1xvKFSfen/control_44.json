My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a dad talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The dad's girlfriend got upset and left, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The dad has two kids, lives with his girlfriend, and she lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids a few days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. Then, after hearing concerns from Reddit comments about the kids sensing the girlfriend's lack of interest, he talked to his son about his feelings. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the dad overstep by discussing the girlfriend with his son? The dad's intention was to check in on the kids' well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the girlfriend felt betrayed, which is a valid emotion. The question is whether the dad should have discussed this without her consent.\n\nIn many cases, parents need to support their children's emotional needs, which might involve discussing the household dynamics. However, involving the child in such discussions could potentially create tension if not handled carefully. The dad's action was to protect the children's well-being, but it inadvertently caused conflict with his partner.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but her feeling of being undermined is understandable. The dad didn't consult her before the conversation, which might have been a point of contention. In a healthy relationship, communication between partners is crucial. The dad might have a valid point in needing to talk to his kids, but he should have perhaps discussed this with his girlfriend first to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nSo, the dad's intentions were good, but the method might have been lacking. It's a balance between a parent's duty to their children and respecting their partner's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is over the top, but the dad could have handled it more sensitively. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's some nuance. However, since the question is binary A or B, and considering that the dad was acting in his children's best interest without malicious intent, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no other angle. The main issue is whether talking to the child about the girlfriend was inappropriate. If the dad's goal was to ensure the child's well-being, it's a valid action. The girlfriend's reaction is the problem here, not the dad's action. So the answer is B.\n"
