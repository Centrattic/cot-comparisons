My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a father living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job and was asked to help with the kids, which led to conflict. The author then talked to his oldest son about how the son perceives the girlfriend and the changes in his mom. The girlfriend found out and got extremely upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, the key points here. The father wanted to check in with his son about how he's coping with the changes. That seems reasonable because kids' feelings are important. He didn't tell the girlfriend beforehand, which might be why she's upset. But is that his fault?\n\nHe argues that he needs to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend. That makes sense because parents should be able to discuss their children's well-being. However, the way he approached it could be an issue. Did he mention the girlfriend specifically in a critical way? The post says the conversation was about both the son's mother and the girlfriend, so maybe not just negative. But the girlfriend felt undermined, which is a valid emotion.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems a bit over the top. Leaving the house over this might be an overreaction, but her feelings of betrayal need to be considered. The father didn't discuss the conversation with her first, which could have caused trust issues. However, the father's intent was to ensure his son's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nSo, was the father in the wrong? He did something he thought was right for his child. He didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend, but didn't consider her feelings. It's a balance between parenting rights and partner communication. The father might not be in the wrong for wanting to talk to his son, but maybe he should have discussed it with his girlfriend first to avoid conflict. However, since it's about his children, he might have a right to do so without needing permission. \n\nIn the context of a relationship, communication is key. If the girlfriend felt betrayed, maybe the father should have been more considerate. But the father's action was to check on his child, which is important. So, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. The girlfriend's overreaction might be her issue, not his. The author's intent was not malicious, so he's not an asshole.\n"
