My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the guy in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that he talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend took it as an attack and left. The guy is asking if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. He's a parent with two kids and a live-in girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids, which led to some conflict. Now, he talks to his son about his perceptions of the girlfriend, and the girlfriend is upset about that.\n\nSo, the key points here: as a parent, does he have the right to talk to his child about his living situation, including his partner? The guy says the conversation was also about the kids' biological mother being away, so it's part of a broader discussion about their family life. The girlfriend feels undermined and that he lacks confidence in her. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important for kids to express their feelings and for parents to be aware of how their decisions affect their children. The guy mentions that he wanted to check if the kids were okay after a recent change (mom being away), and to understand their feelings towards the girlfriend. That seems responsible. However, the girlfriend's reaction is intense\u2014she left and said he betrayed her. \n\nBut is the father wrong for having that conversation without discussing it with the girlfriend first? The father argues that he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids freely. The girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child is a privacy issue or that it's a criticism of her. However, the father's intent was to understand his child's well-being, not to undermine the girlfriend. \n\nIn many cases, parents do discuss household members with their children. It's part of helping the child adjust. However, if the conversation involved negative perceptions or was done to criticize the girlfriend, that could be problematic. The father says the conversation was balanced, talking about both the girlfriend and the other parent's absence. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that being discussed behind her back is a breach of trust. But since he's the parent, he has a responsibility to his children's emotional state. If the girlfriend is part of the household, the kids would naturally talk about her, and it's the parent's role to facilitate that. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, but her feelings are valid to some extent. However, the father's actions were justified for the sake of his children. The problem might be communication\u2014maybe he should have explained his intentions to the girlfriend first, but the father's main duty is to his kids. \n\nIn terms of whether he's the asshole, it's about intent vs. perception. His intent was to check on his kids' well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional and possibly overreacting, but that doesn't make the father wrong. So probably answer B: No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
