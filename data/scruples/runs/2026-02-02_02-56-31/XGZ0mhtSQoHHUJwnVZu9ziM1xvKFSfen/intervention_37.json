My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is a parent with two kids and a girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to help with the kids, which caused some conflict. Then, he talked to his oldest son about his feelings towards the girlfriend and the situation. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her and lacked confidence in her. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe user's main argument is that he needed to talk to his son to understand if the kids were being affected by the changes, especially since others suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's reluctance. He feels that discussing his child's well-being is his right as a parent, and he didn't mean to undermine his girlfriend. He's defending that the conversation was about both the ex-mother and the girlfriend, not just the girlfriend.\n\nNow, considering the situation: Parents have a duty to ensure their children's emotional well-being. Talking to a child about their living arrangements and relationships is a normal part of parenting. However, the girlfriend might feel that being discussed without her input is a breach of trust. The key here is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend specifically without her knowledge.\n\nBut from a parental standpoint, ensuring the child feels secure and is not being negatively affected by new family dynamics is crucial. The father's action seems to be in the best interest of his child. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her position isn't respected. However, the father isn't obligated to clear every conversation with his partner before talking to his kids. It's part of his parental responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the father could have approached the conversation differently, perhaps by involving the girlfriend in discussions about the children's needs, but the act of talking to his son directly isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the father isn't wrong for prioritizing his son's emotional state.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because he's acting as a responsible parent by checking in with his child about their well-being in a significant life change.\n"
