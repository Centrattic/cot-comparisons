My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the kid perceives the girlfriend. So, here's the situation: He lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school, but she got angry and called him an asshole. Then, he talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the girlfriend and the situation. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. He's now wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. As a parent, it's important to check in with the kids about their well-being and adjust accordingly. The user had the intention to see how his son is coping with the changes in family dynamics, like his mom being away and the new living situation with the girlfriend. He thought it was necessary to make sure the kids are okay. But the girlfriend took it as a personal attack, feeling that he doesn't trust her.\n\nNow, from the girlfriend's point of view, she might feel that discussing her with the child could affect the child's perception of her, especially if the child is young. If the conversation wasn't handled properly, it could lead the child to question her role as a step-parent or guardian. The girlfriend might also feel that her privacy or relationship with the child is being meddled with, especially if she wasn't consulted beforehand.\n\nBut the user is arguing that he's an adult and has the right to talk to his children without needing permission. He's a parent, so talking to the kids is part of his parental responsibility. The issue here is whether discussing the girlfriend with the child is appropriate. If the conversation was about the child's feelings and not a criticism of the girlfriend, maybe it's justified. However, if it's perceived as a third party in the relationship, it might cause conflict.\n\nAlso, the user's intention was important. If he was genuinely concerned about the child's well-being and not trying to undermine the girlfriend, then maybe it's just a communication issue. But the way he approached it might have been sensitive. Maybe he should have discussed it with the girlfriend first to avoid misunderstandings, especially since they're living together and involved in a relationship. The girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child is a breach of trust, even if it's from a parental standpoint.\n\nAnother angle is the child's age. The oldest is 14, so he's old enough to have such conversations. However, involving the child in adult relationship dynamics can be tricky. The parent needs to ensure that the child isn't caught in the middle. The key is whether the conversation focused on the child's feelings or criticized the girlfriend. If the conversation was balanced and aimed at understanding the child's perspective, then it's reasonable.\n\nIn summary, the user's actions could be seen as necessary from a parental duty, but the girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling disrespected or not trusted. The answer depends on the context of the conversation and how it was framed. If the parent approached it as a way to support the child and not to criticize the girlfriend, then he's not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend felt undermined without cause, that's another issue. The user might not be wrong, but there's room for better communication to prevent such conflicts.\n"
