My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a dad living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to help with the kids, which led to conflict because she was upset about being called an asshole. Then he talked to his oldest son about how the boy felt about the girlfriend, his mom being away, etc. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and accused the author of not trusting her. The author is now asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' responsibilities. The author wanted to check in with his son about how he's adjusting to the new living situation, especially with the girlfriend and his mom being away. That seems like a reasonable concern. Parents should be aware of their children's feelings, so talking to them about their family dynamics makes sense.\n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is pretty strong. She felt that talking to the son about her was undermining her. Is that a valid concern? Maybe she felt insecure or like she's not being trusted. On the other hand, the author is not doing anything wrong by communicating with his own child about the people in their lives. The conversation was also about the mother's situation, not just the girlfriend. The author didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to understand his perspective.\n\nThe key points here are the intent of the author and the nature of the conversation. The author's intent was to check in with his son for his well-being and to ensure the kids are adjusting well. The girlfriend's feeling of being undermined might stem from insecurity, but the author has every right to talk to his children about their family dynamics. The girlfriend's reaction seems a bit over the top, and the author isn't in the wrong for doing something necessary as a parent. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
