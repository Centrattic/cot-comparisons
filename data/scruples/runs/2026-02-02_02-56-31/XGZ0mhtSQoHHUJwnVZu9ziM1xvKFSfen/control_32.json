My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a father of two boys, living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict where she called him an asshole. Now, the author had a conversation with his son about how he feels about his mother being away and the girlfriend. After the son, the girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author is now asking if he's the asshole for having that conversation.\n\nThe key points here are: the father's responsibility to his children's well-being, the nature of the conversation, and the girlfriend's reaction. The father had a valid reason to check in with his son about how he's adjusting to the changes in his family structure. Parents often have these kinds of conversations with their children to ensure they're okay. The issue seems to be that the girlfriend felt her position was being questioned, leading to her emotional response.\n\nBut is the father wrong? Well, he's the parent; it's part of his role to communicate with his children and assess their feelings. The girlfriend might have felt insecure, but the father wasn't speaking poorly of her or trying to undermine her. The conversation was about the child's perception, which is appropriate. The father didn't need permission from the girlfriend to talk to his own child. The girlfriend's reaction might be a problem, but the father's action was justified in ensuring his son's emotional state. So, the father isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
