My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's a father, had a conversation with his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset and accused him of undermining her. The author's argument is that he needed to talk to his kids about their mother being away and about the girlfriend, to make sure the kids are okay. The girlfriend is upset because she feels he didn't have confidence in her and that he betrayed her by talking to the son about her without discussing it with her first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent, so his primary responsibility is to his children. He mentions that he did this conversation because he was concerned about the kids' well-being, especially after previous feedback suggested the kids might be picking up on the tension between the girlfriend and the author. That makes sense from a parental standpoint. Parents often need to talk to their kids about various aspects of their lives, including new family members or relationships.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. She's upset that he discussed her with the son without her consent. In a relationship, trust and communication are key. If the author had discussed the conversation with his girlfriend beforehand, maybe they could have navigated it better. But the question is whether he had a right to talk to his son about her without her knowing. Since he's the parent, he has a duty to address his children's needs and feelings, especially when it involves their family structure. The girlfriend might feel disrespected, but the parent's duty to the children might override that.\n\nBut then again, if the author had kept the conversation strictly about the kids' feelings and not been critical of the girlfriend, maybe the girlfriend wouldn't have been so upset. The author mentions that the conversation was as much about the mother's absence as about the girlfriend, but if he didn't criticize the girlfriend, then maybe the girlfriend's reaction is over the top. However, the fact that she took it as an underhanded comment could be a communication issue between them.\n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend is in a position where she's living with the author and his children. She might feel that her role as a stepmother is being questioned, leading to insecurity. The author's action might have triggered those insecurities. But as a parent, he has a right to discuss family matters with his children. The problem might be more about how the conversation was framed or whether there was a misunderstanding.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, I think it's a nuanced situation. The author's intention was to check in with his son about how he's adjusting, which is a responsible act. However, the girlfriend's feelings about being discussed without her knowledge could be valid. The key here is whether the author approached the conversation with the son in a way that was fair to both the son and the girlfriend. If he didn't criticize the girlfriend and was just seeking the son's honest feelings, then he's probably in the right. But if he hinted that the girlfriend wasn't doing a good job, that's another matter.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action seems justified as part of his parental duty. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from personal insecurities rather than a legitimate wrongdoing by the author. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
