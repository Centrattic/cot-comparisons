My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author has two kids, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old. He moved in with his girlfriend, and she lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to some conflict. Then, after some comments on his previous post, he decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about how the son feels regarding his mother being away, living with the author, and his opinion of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was upset, feeling undermined and that the author doesn't have confidence in her. She left to stay with a friend and said she needs time to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intention was to check in with his son about his feelings, which the son seemed okay with. The girlfriend's reaction is that this conversation was an attack on her and a betrayal. The author argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without needing her permission.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, talking to your children about their feelings, especially regarding their step-parent, is a normal part of parenting. The children's well-being is important, and parents should be able to assess how their kids are coping. However, the way the conversation was handled might be an issue. Did he talk to the son about the girlfriend in a way that was critical or negative? The author says the conversation was as much about the son's mother's trip as about the girlfriend, so maybe he was just getting the son's perspective. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems over the top. She might feel threatened, maybe feeling like her role as a step-parent is being questioned. However, the parent has a right to communicate with his child about family dynamics. It's possible he didn't go into the conversation with negative intent, but the girlfriend's insecurity or miscommunication led to the conflict. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for wanting to ensure his child is comfortable. Parents should be able to discuss their children's feelings without it being seen as undermining a partner unless there were specific negative comments. The answer here is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for communication between the couple to address the girlfriend's feelings without it being a betrayal.\n"
