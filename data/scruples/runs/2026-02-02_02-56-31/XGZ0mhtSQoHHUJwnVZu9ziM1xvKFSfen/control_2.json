My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a father who lives with his girlfriend and two sons. His girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. Now, after some reflection, he decided to talk to his oldest son about how he feels about the situation and about the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and that he doesn't have confidence in her. She left the house and is rethinking the relationship.\n\nThe author's main point is that he needed to talk to his son about his well-being, especially since others had mentioned that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. He felt it was necessary to check in with his son, and the conversation was also about the mother being away. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. As a parent, I think you do have the right to talk to your kids about their well-being and how they're adjusting to family dynamics. The author's intention was to ensure his son was okay with the living situation and the new partner. However, the girlfriend felt that discussing her with the son was undermining her. So there's a conflict between a parent's responsibility to their child and a partner's expectation of privacy or respect.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't talk to the son to criticize the girlfriend. He mentions the conversation was also about the mother being away. So maybe his primary concern was the son's adjustment, not to attack the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems intense\u2014calling it betrayal and comparing him to a 6-year-old. That's a lot. However, the author might not have considered how the girlfriend would perceive the conversation. Maybe he should have discussed it with her first, even though his intention was to talk to the child. But isn't it normal for parents to discuss their children's feelings with them, even if it involves the other parent or a partner?\n\nWait, in this case, the girlfriend is not the mother. The kids' mother isn't present, and the author is co-parenting with the ex? Or is the son's mother away? The original post's link isn't accessible, but the user mentions the son's mother being away. So the current girlfriend is living with the father and the kids. So the father is talking to his son about how he feels about the new situation. The girlfriend's reaction is that the father is undermining her by discussing her with the son. But isn't it part of parenting to address the child's perceptions of all adults in their life, especially those living with them?\n\nThe key point here is intent. The author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, not to criticize the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling undermined, but the father's action is part of his parental responsibility. However, perhaps the father should have approached the conversation more carefully. Maybe he could have discussed the son's feelings without focusing so directly on the girlfriend's role, or perhaps he should have considered the girlfriend's feelings more. But since the father didn't go into the conversation to attack her, maybe he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, but maybe she's hurting because she's unemployed and taking the father's request to help with the kids as criticism. \n\nSo, the author's action was a parent's duty to their child, and while it's unfortunate that the girlfriend felt hurt, the father isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No). But I need to make sure. Another angle: if a parent discusses a partner's role with the child, does that undermine the partner? It could, depending on how it's done. But the father's intent was to ensure the child's well-being. So, no, he's not the asshole.\n"
