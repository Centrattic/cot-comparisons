My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves a live-in girlfriend, two sons, and the girlfriend is upset about the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents should communicate with their kids about family dynamics, especially when there are changes like a new guardian figure (the girlfriend) in their lives. The parent wanted to check in on how the kid is adjusting, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is strong. She feels undermined. But the parent didn't have to involve the girlfriend in that decision. The parent has a right to talk to their own child about their feelings without needing permission from their partner, especially if it's about the child's well-being.\n\nThe key points here: the parent's action was to ensure the child's adjustment, which is important. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her role is being questioned. However, the parent's action was necessary and not an attack on the girlfriend. The parent didn't go into the conversation with negative intent but to understand the child's perspective.\n\nSo, the parent is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
