My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic with children, an ex-wife, and a new girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The father wanted to check in with his son about how he's feeling regarding the girlfriend's role in the household. The son was positive, but the girlfriend took offense, feeling undermined. The father argues he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids without prior approval from his girlfriend.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with the son. The father's intention was to ensure the kids were okay, which seems responsible. But the girlfriend felt disrespected. The question is about boundaries in a blended family.\n\nIn terms of parenting, it's important to communicate with children, especially about family dynamics affecting them. The father didn't go behind the girlfriend's back; he had the conversation openly. However, maybe he could have considered the girlfriend's feelings more? But the father's responsibility is to his kids, not to seek approval from his girlfriend for parenting decisions.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. If she's in a long-term relationship with the father, she's part of his family. The kids need to feel comfortable and safe, so discussing their feelings is crucial. The father didn't badmouth the girlfriend; he just asked the son for his perspective. So, the father isn't the asshole here. The girlfriend should respect his role as a parent. Answer B.\n"
