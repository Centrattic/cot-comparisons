My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the boy perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that they live together with their two kids and the girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job and was asked to help with the kids, which caused some conflict. The user then talked to their oldest son about how he felt regarding the mother (who isn't present) and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, thinking he undermined her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents should communicate with their children about family dynamics, especially when there are changes like a new caregiver. It's important for the kids to feel secure and understand the situation. The user had a valid reason to check in with their son to ensure he's adjusting well, especially after earlier comments on the previous post about the kids sensing tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels her relationship with the father was breached by discussing her with the son. The user didn't involve the girlfriend in the conversation, which might have been a mistake. But as a parent, they have the right to talk to their children about their family without needing permission from a partner. However, maybe there's a balance here. Was the conversation necessary? Was it framed in a way that could be seen as critical of the girlfriend? If the user approached the conversation openly and without negativity, it might be reasonable. But if they were seeking to gather information to criticize the girlfriend, that's different.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that the conversation was as much about the ex-wife being away as about the girlfriend. So the intent was balanced. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but relationships require communication and mutual respect. The parent might have failed to consider the girlfriend's feelings, but the act of talking to the child is part of their responsibility. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the parent acted in the best interest of the child, which they did, but perhaps could have communicated better with the girlfriend first. However, the parent isn't wrong for prioritizing the child's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the parent could have handled it more sensitively. Overall, the parent isn't the asshole here, but there's room for improvement in how they approach such conversations.\n"
