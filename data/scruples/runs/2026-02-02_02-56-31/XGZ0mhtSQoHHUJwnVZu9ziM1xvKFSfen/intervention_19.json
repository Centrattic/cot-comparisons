My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The user has two kids, lives with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job and was asked to pick up the kids, which led to conflict. Then, the user talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the girlfriend and the situation. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility to their children. Parents should communicate openly with their kids, especially regarding their well-being and family dynamics. The user was checking in with his son to ensure he wasn't being negatively affected by the new living situation. That seems like a responsible action. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also valid because she might feel that discussing her in such a context without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nBut the key here is the intent. The user didn't talk to the son to undermine the girlfriend; he was focused on the child's feelings. The son's well-being is a priority, and parents should prioritize that. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about feeling insecure or not being trusted, but the user has the right to ensure his children are comfortable and healthy in the new family structure.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user should have considered how the girlfriend might feel. Perhaps discussing the girlfriend's role through the child could be seen as a backdoor way of giving the child a platform to criticize her, even if that wasn't the intention. However, the user's intention was to understand the child's perspective, not to criticize the girlfriend. \n\nIn terms of the relationship dynamics, there's a balance between maintaining the child's best interest and respecting the partner's feelings. While the user isn't in the wrong for talking to his son, he might need to communicate better with his girlfriend in the future to avoid such misunderstandings. But the action itself\u2014talking to the child\u2014doesn't seem wrong. The girlfriend's overreaction might stem from deeper issues in the relationship rather than the act itself.\n\nSo, the user isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
