My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has two boys, 8 and 14. His girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which she resented. Previous Reddit comments suggested the kids might be sensing her lack of willingness. So the author talked to his oldest son (14) about his feelings regarding his mom being away, living with them, and his thoughts on the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's intention was to check in with his son about how he's feeling, which is a parent's responsibility. He mentions that the conversation was also about the son's mother being away. The girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she feels her position is undermined and that the author doesn't trust her. But the author argues that he needs to talk to his children without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important to ensure the children's well-being and emotional state. Discussing family dynamics with children is a normal part of parenting. The author didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend directly; he was addressing the child's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her role in the family is being questioned or not trusted. However, the author has a right to communicate openly with his children about family matters, especially since they're teenagers and the older child is old enough to have such discussions.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. The author isn't sharing private details about her but is focusing on the child's perception. The fact that the conversation included both the son's feelings about his mother and the girlfriend suggests a balanced approach. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his child's emotional well-being. While the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the author isn't obligated to clear conversations with his children with his partner first. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
