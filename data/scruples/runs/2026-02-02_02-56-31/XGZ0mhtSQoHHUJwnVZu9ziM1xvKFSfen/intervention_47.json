My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves his son, his girlfriend, and previous issues where the girlfriend felt upset about being asked to pick up the kids. Now, after talking to his son, the girlfriend is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to check in with his son about how he's feeling, especially considering the previous concerns from Reddit comments. As a parent, he has a responsibility to ensure his children are adjusting well to the new living situation. The conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about the son's mother being away. The user argues that he needed to talk to his son without needing permission from his girlfriend, which makes sense because parents should have open lines of communication with their children.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is intense\u2014she left the house and wants to rethink the relationship. She feels undermined and lacking trust. The key here is whether the conversation was done in a way that respected his girlfriend's feelings. Did the user approach the conversation with the son in a way that was critical of the girlfriend, or was it neutral and focused on the son's well-being? The user mentions that the son had valid thoughts and was happy, so maybe the conversation wasn't negative. But the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without her knowledge breaches trust, especially if there's a history of tension.\n\nIn relationships, especially when there are children involved, communication is crucial. While the user's intent was valid, the method might have been a misstep. If the conversation with the son was done in a way that made the girlfriend feel criticized, then it could be seen as a breach of trust. However, if it was a neutral, parental check-in, then the user isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but her feelings are valid. The user might need to have an open conversation with his girlfriend to explain his intentions and reassure her, rather than it being a matter of right or wrong. But from the information given, the user's actions seem justified as a parent's duty, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
