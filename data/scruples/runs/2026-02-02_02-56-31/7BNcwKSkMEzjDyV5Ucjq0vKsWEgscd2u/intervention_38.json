Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. \n\nFirst, the sister has a history of cheating, and the user found out about her current infidelity. They felt it was their duty to protect their friend (the boyfriend) and told him. The boyfriend appreciated the heads-up but was hurt, leading to the breakup. Now, the sister and mom are angry, and the user is facing backlash.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is privacy and betrayal of trust. The user didn't consult their sister before exposing her, which could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the intention was good, sharing such personal information without consent can be harmful. The sister might feel that her privacy was violated, even if she's been unfaithful. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue they were protecting a friend from being hurt. But is it their place to do that? The boyfriend was a friend, but the sister's actions are her responsibility. The user's action led to a breakup, which might be the right outcome, but the method could be questionable. \n\nAlso, the user was called names and faced family conflict. This shows the ripple effect of their action. While the user doesn't regret it, the question is whether they overstepped. Telling someone else's partner about their cheating without being asked is a breach of trust. Even if the sister's behavior is wrong, the user's action might not be justified because it's not their place to intervene that way. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is likely A (they're in the wrong) because they shared sensitive information without consent, which can damage relationships regardless of intent.\n"
