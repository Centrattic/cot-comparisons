Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating is in the wrong. They answered A or B based on the situation.\n\nFirst, looking at the details: the sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt compelled to tell the boyfriend because they didn't want their friend to get hurt. The sister and mom are upset, even threatening to kick them out. The author doesn't regret their decision despite the backlash.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Privacy is a big factor here. The author is sharing information that isn't theirs to disclose. Even if the sister's actions are wrong, the author stepping in might be seen as overstepping. They might have good intentions, but invading someone's privacy, especially in a family, can cause major conflicts.\n\nAlso, the sister's right to her relationship. Even if she's unfaithful, the boyfriend has the choice to handle it himself. By revealing the cheating, the author took that agency away from the boyfriend, maybe causing more harm than good. The boyfriend was thankful, but the aftermath has led to family tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was to protect a friend from being hurt. It's a common dilemma where someone tries to prevent harm by exposing a partner's infidelity. However, the method used might not be appropriate. It's possible that encouraging the boyfriend to confront the sister himself could be a better approach.\n\nFamily dynamics are also at play. The mom and sister are furious, which shows that the author's actions caused significant family strife. The author might have acted in what they thought was the right way, but the consequences are severe, affecting their home life and relationships.\n\nIn legal terms, unless there's a legal obligation to report something, there's no law against lying in a relationship. So legally, the sister isn't committing a crime the author is required to report. Ethically, it's more complicated. The author's action might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the intent was good.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions led to the breakup and family conflict. While the intention was to help, the method of intervention without the sister's consent could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they breached confidentiality and caused division within the family.\n"
