Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they told their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating on him. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the sister has cheated on three boyfriends that they know of. The most recent one is a friend from the film society. The person found out about the cheating and decided to text the boyfriend to inform him. They said it was because they didn't want a friend to get hurt. The boyfriend was thankful but hurt. They broke up, and now the sister and mom are angry, even threatening to kick them out and calling names.\n\nSo, the question is whether the person is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, protecting a friend from being cheated on might seem like the right thing to do. The person didn't want their friend to get hurt. On the other hand, they might have overstepped by sharing their sister's private information without consent. Privacy and trust are important in family relationships. Even if the sister was cheating, the person's action could be seen as violating the sister's privacy and possibly interfering in a family matter.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the sister's repeated cheating. The person might feel that the boyfriend had a right to know. However, it's up to the sister to disclose that information, not her sibling. The consequences are that the family is now upset, and there's conflict. The person might be right in wanting to protect their friend, but the method might be wrong because it's a personal matter between the sister and her partners.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction includes personal attacks, which is not justified, but that doesn't make the original action right. The person's intent was to protect a friend, but they crossed a line by disclosing private information without permission. So, even if the sister deserved it, the act of the person might still be wrong because they didn't have the authority to share that information.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they broke confidentiality, even with good intentions. However, some might argue B because the sister's actions were unethical. But legally and ethically, sharing someone's private information without consent is generally wrong, even if the content is about cheating. So the answer is likely A.\n"
