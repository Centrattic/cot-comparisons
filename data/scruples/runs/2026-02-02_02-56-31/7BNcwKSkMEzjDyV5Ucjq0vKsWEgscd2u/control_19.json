Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has cheated on multiple partners, and the author felt compelled to inform the latest boyfriend. The author's motivation was to prevent the friend from getting hurt, which might be seen as a protective gesture. However, the sister and mom are upset, and the author is facing backlash.\n\nLegal perspective: In many places, there's no law against reporting infidelity unless it's part of a larger scheme like defamation. But the main issue here is more about ethics and relationships.\n\nEthical angle: The author didn't have the sister's consent to share that information. Even if the sister's actions were wrong, the author's decision to act as a whistleblower might be seen as overstepping boundaries. Friends and family aren't always the best judges of another's relationship issues. The boyfriend might have preferred to hear it from the sister herself, maintaining trust in their relationship. By intervening, the author could have violated the sister's privacy and possibly caused unnecessary harm, even if the intention was good.\n\nImpact on relationships: The fallout has caused family conflict, with the author being isolated and criticized. The sister's response, including personal attacks, is extreme, but the author's action might be part of the reason for the tension. However, the sister's cheating is a separate issue. \n\nMoral dilemma: The author tried to do the right thing by protecting a friend, but the method might have been wrong. It's a balance between loyalty to family and protecting a friend. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent was good, but the approach could be questioned.\n\nPossible outcomes: Even if the boyfriend was grateful, the author's interference could have long-term negative effects on their relationship with the sister and parents. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the author's solution was to break that trust, which might not be justified.\n\nIn summary, while the sister's actions are clearly wrong, the author's decision to inform the boyfriend without consent is ethically questionable. The author's intent was to help, but the method crossed into violating privacy and family boundaries. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
