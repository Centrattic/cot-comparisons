Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. The author's sister has a history of cheating on multiple boyfriends, and the author, who used to be friends with the current boyfriend, told him about the cheating. The sister and mom are upset, and the sister has been bullying the author about weight and gynecomastia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Tattling on a family member's cheating could be seen as protecting a friend from harm. On the other hand, the author didn't ask for the boyfriend's permission and violated the sister's privacy. The sister's right to confidentiality might be a factor here. Even if the author had good intentions, they might have overstepped by not confiding in the sister first or seeking advice from a neutral party.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction is harsh, including name-calling and making fun of the author's appearance. The mom threatened to kick the author out, but the dad stopped it. The author feels like walking on eggshells, which is a stressful situation. The question is whether the author's actions were justified despite the fallout.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that protecting a friend from being cheated on is right, but others might say the author should have approached it differently, maybe by talking to the sister first or seeking counseling. The sister's privacy and the family dynamics are important here. The fact that the sister has a history of cheating might make the author feel more justified, but the method of disclosure is a key point.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the intention was to help a friend, but the method involved breaking confidentiality without consent. Depending on cultural or personal values, the answer could vary. However, in terms of right and wrong, the author's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the motive was good. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect their sister's privacy and took matters into their own hands without proper channels.\n"
