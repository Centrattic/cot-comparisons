Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating on him. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of cheating, at least three times according to the user. The boyfriend is a friend from the film society. The user felt the boyfriend was being hurt and thought it was right to tell him. The boyfriend was thankful but hurt. Now, the sister and mom are upset, even aggressive, and the user is facing backlash. The user is defending their action by saying they didn't regret it.\n\nHmm, the main question is about right or wrong. From a legal standpoint, maybe not illegal, but ethically? The user is sharing private information about their sister without her consent. That's a breach of privacy. The sister might have a right to her privacy, even if she's done wrong. The user's intention was to protect a friend, which is understandable, but the method involved exposing their sister's actions without her knowing.\n\nThere's also the aspect of family dynamics. The sister and mom are upset, leading to conflict at home. The user is facing emotional consequences. Is the user justified in their action? Well, maybe they thought they were doing the right thing to prevent harm. But in doing so, they crossed into the sister's privacy and caused more harm to their family relationships.\n\nOn one hand, the user wanted to help their friend. On the other, they didn't give their sister a chance to address the issue herself or perhaps confront her first. Also, the sister's actions are wrong, but the user's response might not be the best approach. Maybe the user should have talked to the sister first, given her a chance to own up or stop the cheating, before involving the boyfriend.\n\nThe answer could be a mix of perspectives. Legally, maybe not wrong, but morally and ethically, there's a case to be made that the user overstepped by sharing private information. So, in terms of being in the wrong, it's possible. The user's action might have been a good intention but with poor execution. The answer might lean towards A (Yes) because they violated privacy, even if the intention was good. However, some might argue B (No) because they prevented someone from being cheated on. But generally, respecting privacy is a strong ethical point. So likely A.\n"
