Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they told their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, and the person felt bad for their friend (the brother's ex-buddy) and wanted to protect him. Now, the sister and mom are upset, and the person is dealing with family backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The person's intention was to protect their friend from being hurt, which seems like a good motive. But did they overstep by sharing personal information without the sister's consent? Privacy is a big factor. Even if the sister was cheating, the person who told the boyfriend might have breached her privacy. \n\nThen there's the aspect of family responsibility. Siblings often have a duty to each other, but if one is in a harmful situation, is it the sibling's role to intervene? Maybe, but the method matters. Spilling the beans directly to the boyfriend might have been a way to help, but it's also possible that a different approach, like advising the boyfriend to talk to the sister himself or seeking family counseling, could have been better.\n\nThe sister's behavior is problematic\u2014cheating multiple times. The person might have felt that the boyfriend deserved to know. But even so, the sister has a right to privacy, and the person might have violated that. However, the boyfriend was a friend, so the person might have thought they were protecting their friend's interests.\n\nThe family is upset because they feel betrayed. The mother and sister might see the disclosure as an invasion of privacy and betrayal of trust. The person might be in the wrong because they didn't handle it through the proper channels, like advising the boyfriend to confront the sister first, rather than just telling him directly.\n\nBut on the other hand, if the person believed that the boyfriend was being intentionally misled and wanted to prevent further harm, their action could be seen as a moral choice to protect someone else, even if it was done without consent. It's a tough call because it's a balance between respecting privacy and preventing harm.\n"
