Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. The situation is that the sister has cheated on three boyfriends, and the author, who used to know the latest boyfriend, told him about the cheating. The sister and mom are upset, and the author is dealing with backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Telling someone that their partner is cheating involves a privacy issue. The sister's infidelity is between her and her boyfriend, but the author intervened. The question is whether this was justified. \n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they were protecting their friend from being hurt. They mention feeling bad seeing a friend get hurt, so their intention was to prevent further pain. That's a noble motive, but intentions don't always justify actions. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's privacy and autonomy are factors. The author decided to share personal information without her consent. Even if the sister has a history of cheating, the author's disclosure could have consequences beyond the immediate situation. The sister and her family are now upset, and the author is facing family conflict. \n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. By telling the boyfriend, the author might have broken the sister's trust, but the sister's actions (cheating) might have already compromised that. However, the author's role in this is more complex. They had a personal relationship with the boyfriend, which might have influenced their decision. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for overstepping. The author might not have been in a position to decide who should know about the sister's actions. Even if the sister's behavior is problematic, the boyfriend has the right to know directly from her, not through a third party. \n\nThe aftermath, with the family's anger and the author being criticized, suggests that the action disrupted family dynamics. The author might not have considered the broader impact on their relationships with their sister and mother. \n\nBut then, there's the argument about preventing harm. If the author believed the boyfriend was being genuinely hurt and the sister wasn't going to admit to the cheating, maybe the author felt compelled to act. However, that's a gray area. It's possible the boyfriend could have discovered the cheating on his own, which might have been harder on him. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tricky situation. The author's motives were to protect a friend, but the method involved breaching confidentiality. Depending on cultural or personal values, this could be seen differently. Some might say it's justified to protect someone from betrayal, while others would argue that it's not the author's place to intervene. \n\nConsidering all these points, I think the author might be in the wrong because they crossed a boundary by sharing private information without consent, even if their intentions were good. The sister's actions are her own responsibility, and the solution might have been to advise the boyfriend to confront her directly instead of disclosing the information.\n"
