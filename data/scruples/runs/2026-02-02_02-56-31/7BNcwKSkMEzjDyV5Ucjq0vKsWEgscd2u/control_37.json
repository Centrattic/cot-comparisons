Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they told their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt bad seeing their friend get hurt. They told the boyfriend, which led to the breakup. Now the sister and mom are upset, even threatening to kick them out, and the sister is being mean about it. The author still doesn't regret it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Telling someone that their partner is cheating without the partner's consent is a big deal. It's about privacy and trust. The sister's actions are wrong, but the author took it upon themselves to expose the cheating. The question is whether that was justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel they were protecting their friend from being hurt. But on the other hand, they didn't consult their sister first. The sister has a right to her privacy, even if her actions are wrong. By revealing that information, the author might have violated that privacy. Also, the author's sister is upset, and the family is in conflict.\n\nThere's also the aspect of family loyalty. Siblings often protect each other, so the sister and mom might feel the author betrayed them. However, the author's friend (the boyfriend) was being deceived, so there's a conflict between protecting a friend and respecting family.\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences. The author might have acted out of a good intention to prevent harm, but the method was without consent. Even if the outcome (the breakup) was better for the boyfriend, was it the author's place to intervene? Maybe the boyfriend should have found out from the sister herself, but that's not likely to happen if she's cheating.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The sister's actions are clearly wrong, but the author's action of revealing the cheating without permission could be seen as a breach of trust. The author might have had good intentions, but the method crossed a line. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't have the right to expose their sister's actions without her consent, even if they thought it was for the good of the friend.\n"
