Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA thread) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has a history of cheating on multiple boyfriends. The latest one is a friend of the author's from their film society days. The author found out the sister was cheating and felt bad for their friend, so they sent him a text with the info. The result was the breakup, and now the sister and mom are furious, even threatening the author. The author stands by their decision despite the backlash.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the sister's actions are clearly wrong, but the author took it upon themselves to act as a whistleblower. But there's a line between protecting a friend and overstepping. The sister's privacy is a big factor here. Even if the sister is a cheater, the author disclosing that information without her consent might be a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to protect their friend from being hurt. The friend was grateful, which suggests that the action had a positive outcome. But the sister's privacy and the author's role in that are conflicting. The author might argue that they were trying to prevent harm, but others might say they shouldn't have involved themselves without being asked. \n\nThe moral dilemma here is whether the ends justify the means. The author's actions preserved their friend's feelings but damaged their relationship with family. It's possible the author is in the wrong for not respecting their sister's privacy, but it's also possible they were justified in protecting a friend. \n\nI think the answer hinges on intent and the nature of the disclosure. If the author acted out of concern for their friend and the friend was appreciative, maybe it's a gray area. But legally and ethically, sharing someone's private information without their consent is generally wrong, even if the intent is good. So the author might be in the wrong. But some people might argue the opposite. It's a tough call, but leaning towards yes, they're in the wrong for breaching confidentiality, even if the sister's actions were wrong.\n"
