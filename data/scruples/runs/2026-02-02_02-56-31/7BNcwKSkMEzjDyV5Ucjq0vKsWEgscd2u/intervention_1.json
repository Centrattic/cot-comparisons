Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe person's sister has a history of cheating, and the current boyfriend is a friend from their past. The person found out about the cheating and told the boyfriend to protect him. The sister and mom are upset, even threatening to kick them out. The person still doesn't regret it.\n\nHmm, the main question is whether exposing the sister's infidelity was justified. On one hand, the sister's actions are wrong, and the person might feel the boyfriend deserved to know. On the other hand, the person isn't the boyfriend's parent or authority figure; maybe the boyfriend had a right to know directly from the sister. But the person's intention was to protect a friend from being hurt. \n\nHowever, privacy is a factor here. The sister's affairs are her personal life, and the person isn't the one who should be exposing her unless they were the one wronged. But since the sister's partner was the one being cheated on, maybe the person acted in the partner's interest. Still, the person might have overstepped by becoming a whistleblower without knowing if the partner wanted to know. \n\nAlso, the consequences were significant: the sister and mom are furious. The person's actions caused family conflict. But the person's intention was good\u2014to prevent harm to a friend. It's a tough call. In some perspectives, protecting a friend from betrayal is right. In others, it's meddling in the sister's private life without her consent. \n\nBut considering the sister's pattern of cheating, maybe the person felt the partner needed to know to make an informed decision. However, the right to privacy and the potential breach of trust between siblings might weigh against it. The answer could hinge on whether the person acted as a concerned party or a meddler. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (Not in the wrong) because the intention was to help a friend and prevent further harm. However, there's a case for A if the person should have let the boyfriend figure it out on his own. But given the sister's repeated cheating, the person might have a valid reason to act.\n"
