Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating is in the wrong. The situation is complicated because it's a family issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a history of cheating on multiple boyfriends. The author, who is the sister's sibling, found out the sister was cheating on her current boyfriend, who's also a friend from the past. The author felt it was their duty to tell the boyfriend to protect him from being hurt, even though it caused tension in their family. The mother and sister are upset, with the sister being especially harsh, but the author still doesn't regret their actions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was right to intervene. On one hand, the sister's actions are clearly wrong, and the boyfriend had a right to know. The author might have been trying to do the right thing by preventing the boyfriend from being deceived. On the other hand, the author didn't have the sister's permission to share that information, which could be a breach of trust. Family loyalty might suggest that the author should have kept it to themselves or tried to handle it within the family first.\n\nBut the sister's actions are unethical, and the author might have felt that the boyfriend's right to know outweighed the family's disapproval. Also, the author mentions that the boyfriend was grateful, even if hurt, which could support the decision. However, the fallout with the family is significant, and the author is now facing backlash. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, there's a debate here between loyalty to family versus doing what's right for another person. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was to protect a friend from being cheated on. However, they could have considered other ways to approach the situation, like talking to the sister first or seeking advice before involving the boyfriend. \n\nBut since the sister's cheating is a pattern, the author might feel justified in stepping in to prevent further harm. The boyfriend's gratitude suggests that the author did the right thing. Still, the method of disclosure could be questioned. Was it appropriate to directly tell the boyfriend without first addressing it with the sister or another family member?\n\nIn some perspectives, the author overstepped by becoming a \"tattletale\" without considering the family dynamics. However, given the sister's repeated behavior and the potential for ongoing harm, the author's action could be seen as a necessary intervention. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, it's a tough call. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they aimed to protect someone from being cheated on, even if the method was controversial. But there's also a case that they crossed a boundary by sharing private information without consent. Given the context, I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the intention was to prevent harm, even though it caused family conflict.\n"
