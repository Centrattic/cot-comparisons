Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they told their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, and they felt bad seeing their friend get hurt. They sent the message because they thought it was the right thing to do, even though it caused a lot of family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Was it right to intervene? The person's intention was to protect their friend from being hurt, which is understandable. But they didn't consult with their sister first. In relationships, it's usually the person involved who should address infidelity. So, maybe the person overstepped by not letting the boyfriend find out on his own or through his partner's actions. \n\nThen there's the familial aspect. The sister and mother are upset, which is causing tension at home. The person's actions led to the breakup, which might have been inevitable, but the way it was handled caused additional stress. The sister being mean and making fun of them adds to the emotional impact. \n\nBut the person might argue that they were protecting their friend, even if it meant being a \"snitch.\" The question is whether their intervention was justified. In some cases, people might take action to stop a partner from being deceived, but it's usually expected that the cheating partner handles it. \n\nAlso, the sister's behavior (cheating multiple times) suggests a pattern, so the boyfriend might have known or should have been aware. The person's action could have been a wake-up call, but maybe it's not their place to interfere. \n\nLegally, there's no issue, but morally, it's a gray area. The person's intent was good, but the method might be questionable. They could be seen as violating their sister's privacy without a valid reason. However, their friend's well-being is also a factor. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Some might say the person did the right thing to protect their friend, while others would say it's not their place to interfere in someone else's relationship. The family's reaction is intense, but that doesn't necessarily mean the person was wrong. \n\nSo, the person's action has pros and cons. They might not be in the wrong because their intention was good, but they could have handled it differently. However, since the question is asking if they're in the wrong in a strict sense, it's possible the answer is B (No), but there are arguments for both sides.\n"
