Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they told their sister's boyfriend she was cheating. Their sister has a history of cheating, and the boyfriend is a friend of theirs. The person felt bad seeing their friend get hurt, so they spilled the beans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Telling someone their partner is cheating is a big deal. Normally, that's something the person in the relationship should handle. By stepping in, the user might have overstepped. But on the other hand, their sister has a pattern of deceit, so maybe they had good intentions.\n\nThen there's the impact. The boyfriend was hurt, but he was thankful. However, the sister and mom are upset, leading to family conflict. The user might have caused a rift in the family. But they didn't want to see a friend get hurt, which is understandable.\n\nBoundaries: Did the user have the right to interfere? Maybe not. The boyfriend was a friend, but it's not their place to meddle in their sister's relationships. The sister's actions were wrong, but exposing it to the boyfriend could be seen as a betrayal of trust from the sister's side.\n\nAlso, the consequences: The family is now in conflict, and the user is facing backlash. But the user stands by their decision because they didn't want their friend to be hurt. It's a tough call. \n\nIn some cases, people might think that the user was trying to do the right thing by protecting a friend. But others might say it's not their place to act as a third party. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. However, generally, breaking confidentiality about someone's infidelity could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the intent was good.\n"
