Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user told their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, and the boyfriend is a friend of the user. The user's reasons were that they didn't want their friend to get hurt, and they felt it was the right thing to do.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Tattling on someone's infidelity isn't typically a common thing people do. Usually, people might try to warn the partner without revealing the tattler, but here the user directly told the boyfriend. That seems like a breach of privacy, even if the intent was good. The sister's actions are wrong, but the user's method of addressing it might be questionable.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The user's sister is upset, their mom is angry, and the family dynamics are strained. The user's actions have led to conflict within the family. But the user didn't act out of malice, just to protect their friend. However, maybe they should have approached it differently\u2014like advising their sister to end the relationship instead of exposing her.\n\nAlso, the sister's cheating behavior is a problem. The user is trying to prevent their friend from being hurt again. But by exposing the sister's actions, the user has caused family fallout. The question is whether the user had the right to do that. Privacy is a big factor here. Even if the sister is at fault, the user shared information that wasn't theirs to share.\n\nAnother angle: the user might have thought they were helping their friend, but did they overstep? Could they have supported their friend in other ways without breaking their sister's trust? Maybe. If the user had advised their friend to confront the sister or seek evidence themselves, that might have been a different scenario.\n\nBut the user's main argument is that they didn't want to see their friend hurt. However, exposing someone's infidelity without their consent can have serious consequences, not just for the couple but also for the person who exposed it. In this case, the user is facing backlash from their sister and mom. It's possible that the user acted out of concern, but the method was inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sister is known for cheating, maybe the user believed it was necessary to protect their friend from further harm. But even so, sharing such information without the sister's consent is a breach of confidentiality. Unless there's some legal obligation, like in cases of harm to minors, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nSo, weighing the intent against the action. The intent was good, but the action might have been a violation of privacy. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't have the right to expose their sister's cheating, even if their intention was to help. The right approach might have been to talk to their sister first or support their friend in other ways without direct intervention.\n"
