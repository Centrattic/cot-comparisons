Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating on him. The sister is known to cheat on multiple partners, and the boyfriend is a friend from the past. The author felt bad seeing a friend get hurt and decided to inform him. The result was the breakup, and the sister and mother are angry, even threatening to kick the author out. The author is now facing constant criticism and harassment from them but still doesn't regret the action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Telling someone that their partner is cheating without the partner's consent is a big deal. The author is a family member, so maybe they felt responsible to protect their friend. But there's also the issue of privacy and confidentiality. The sister might have trusted the author with personal information, and by sharing it, the author breached that trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is problematic. Cheating is hurtful, and the boyfriend had a right to know if he was being deceived. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by preventing further harm to their friend. However,\u4ecb\u5165 someone else's relationship without being in a position of authority or being asked to do so can have consequences. The author might not have considered the potential fallout, like breaking up the couple or causing family conflict.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's sister and mother's reaction. They are upset because their privacy was invaded, and they might feel that the author overstepped. The author's actions led to family discord, which is significant. But the sister's repeated cheating is also an issue here. The boyfriend was a friend, so the author might have felt a closer bond there, leading to the decision.\n\nLegally, in some places, you can't be prosecuted for telling someone their partner is cheating unless there's some form of illegal activity involved. But ethically, it's a gray area. The author had good intentions but might have acted without considering the consequences. However, preventing someone from being cheated on could be seen as a positive action.\n\nAnother angle: the author's sister's behavior is clearly problematic, so the author might have thought protecting the boyfriend was necessary. However, the way it was handled\u2014without discussing it with the sister first or maybe trying to mediate\u2014could have been better. But in the end, the boyfriend was thankful, even if hurt, so maybe the author did the right thing.\n\nThe family's reaction is harsh, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was in the wrong. The sister's cheating is her own fault, and the author's action was a response to that. However, the author should have considered whether they had the right to intervene in someone else's personal life like that.\n\nI think there's a balance here. On one hand, the author tried to prevent harm to a friend. On the other, they broke the sister's trust and caused family issues. It's a tough call. But since the sister's actions were the root problem, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But they did cross a line by disclosing private information. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because they shouldn't have shared that information without the sister's consent, even if the intention was good.\n"
