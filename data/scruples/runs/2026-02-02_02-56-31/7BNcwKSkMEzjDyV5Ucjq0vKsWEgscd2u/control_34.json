Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating on him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt bad seeing their mutual friend get hurt. They decided to intervene by informing the boyfriend. The boyfriend was grateful but hurt, and the sister and mom are angry, even threatening to kick them out. The author still feels they did the right thing despite the backlash.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the sister's privacy might be an issue. The author might have overstepped by sharing personal information without the sister's consent. Family dynamics can be complicated here. But on the other hand, the boyfriend was being deceived, and the author wanted to protect a friend.\n\nThere's a conflict between protecting someone from harm and respecting another's privacy. In some cases, informing someone you care about about infidelity can be seen as helping them avoid being hurt further. However, the sister might argue that the author violated her trust. The key factors are intent\u2014whether the author acted with good intentions\u2014and the consequences. The boyfriend was thankful, but the family is upset. \n\nDifferent perspectives: the author might believe they did a good deed, while the sister sees it as betrayal. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Legally, there's no issue, but morally, it's a gray area. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is subjective, but the author doesn't regret their actions and the boyfriend was grateful. So maybe the answer is B, they're not in the wrong. But some might say A, arguing they broke trust. Hmm.\n"
