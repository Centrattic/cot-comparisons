Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, and the boyfriend is a friend of the author's. The author's main reason was that they didn't want their friend to get hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author might be trying to protect their friend from being cheated on, which is understandable. It's not nice to see someone you care about get hurt. But on the other hand, the author is sharing private information without the sister's consent. That's a big deal because people have a right to privacy, even if their actions are wrong.\n\nThen there's the family aspect. The sister and mom are upset, leading to a hostile home environment. The author's actions caused a family conflict, which can have serious consequences. The sister is making fun of the author for their weight and other issues, which is emotional abuse. But does that justify the author's actions?\n\nAlso, the author is interfering in their sister's relationships. Even if the sister is cheating, it's not clear if the author has the right to act as a judge and inform the boyfriend. Relationships are personal, and each person has their own way of handling issues. Maybe the boyfriend should have addressed the cheating himself if he found out.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had the right to share that information. Confidentiality is important. Unless there was some immediate harm or danger, like the sister being in danger, the author might have overstepped. The author might have thought they were helping, but they crossed into the sister's privacy and caused a rift in the family.\n\nHowever, the sister's behavior is a red flag. If she's cheated multiple times, maybe the boyfriend deserved a heads-up. But again, it's not the author's place to disclose that unless the sister gave them permission or there was an explicit request for help. The author acted without consulting the sister, which could be a breach of trust between siblings.\n\nIn terms of consequences, the boyfriend was thankful but hurt, and the family is now in turmoil. The author might have prevented the boyfriend from getting hurt further, but at the cost of their own family relationships. It's a tough balance between helping a friend and respecting family bonds.\n\nI think the key points are privacy, consent, and the right to intervene. The author's actions might have been well-intentioned but crossed ethical boundaries by not seeking the sister's permission and by involving the boyfriend directly. The sister's cheating is wrong, but the author's solution might not be the right approach. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they violated their sister's privacy without justification.\n"
