Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend that the sister is cheating on him. The sister is known to cheat on multiple partners, and the boyfriend is a friend from the past. The author felt it was the right thing to do because they didn't want their friend to get hurt. Now, the sister and mom are upset, and the sister is being harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy and boundaries. The author is a sibling, so there's a family relationship. Telling someone else about a cheater is a big decision. Even if the sister is cheating, the author might have crossed a line by not respecting their sister's privacy. But on the other hand, protecting a friend from being cheated on could be seen as a good intention.\n\nThe sister's bf was thankful, but hurt. So maybe the author didn't do it in the worst way. However, the sister's reaction is intense, leading to family conflict. The author might have overstepped by sharing personal information without consent. In many cases, people are expected to keep such secrets unless there's a compelling reason to share. The author's motivation was to help a friend, which is understandable, but was it their place to do so?\n\nAlso, the sister's behavior being a pattern suggests she might not value relationships, but that doesn't make the author right to expose her. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of trust within the family. Even if the sister is cheating, the author's intervention caused family problems. The mom and sister being angry might indicate that the family values confidentiality and the author violated that.\n\nBut then again, the sister might have continued to cheat on the boyfriend, causing him more harm. The author's action prevented further emotional damage. So there's a balance between protecting the friend and respecting family privacy. It's a tricky situation where both sides have valid points. However, legally and ethically, sharing someone's private affairs without consent is generally not acceptable unless there's a risk of harm. Here, the harm was potential emotional distress, but the sister's cheating was already a pattern. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions were good, but the action might have been wrong because they didn't have the sister's permission to share that information. The right approach might have been to talk to the sister first or not interfere at all. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there's also a case for B (not in the wrong) based on intent.\n"
