Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, and the boyfriend is a friend from the film society. The author felt bad seeing a friend get hurt and decided to warn him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The sister's relationship is her business, and maybe the author shouldn't have interfered. But then again, if someone is being cheated on, they might appreciate knowing the truth, even if it's uncomfortable. The boyfriend was thankful, but also hurt. \n\nThe consequences are that the sister and mom are angry, and there's family tension. The author's sister is being cruel, which is understandable because she's defensive. But the question is whether the author was wrong to act. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping a friend. On the other hand, they broke their sister's privacy and caused family conflict. There's a line between protecting a friend and respecting family boundaries. \n\nI should think about consent. Did the sister's boyfriend have the right to know? The author didn't ask the sister for permission, so it's a breach of trust. However, sometimes people in relationships need to know about infidelity, even if it comes from a third party.\n\nThe author's sister has a pattern of cheating, so maybe there's a history of issues. But the author's role as a sibling might mean they should handle such matters differently. Maybe the right approach would be to talk to the sister first or seek family counseling instead of directly informing the boyfriend.\n\nThe boyfriend being a friend complicates things because the author might have felt a duty to protect them. But even friends have boundaries when it comes to each other's partners. \n\nConsidering the fallout, the author might have acted impulsively without considering the consequences. The sister and mom's anger is a result of their perspective that the author overstepped. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a tough call. If the author's intent was good, but the method was wrong, then maybe they're in the wrong. Or if the intent was genuinely to help, maybe it's understandable. But typically, you don't go between family members and their partners without their consent. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't have the authority to intervene in their sister's relationship. Even with good intentions, it's usually not someone else's place to expose a partner's cheating without the partner's knowledge. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuanced view where it's seen as justified because of the sister's history. \n\nBut generally, respecting people's privacy and autonomy is important. The author's actions caused significant family conflict, which could have been avoided. So probably A.\n"
