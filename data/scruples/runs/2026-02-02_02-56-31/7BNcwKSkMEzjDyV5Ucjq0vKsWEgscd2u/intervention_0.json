Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. Their sister has a history of cheating, and the person felt bad for their friend, so they exposed the sister. Now the family is mad at them.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the sister cheated, the person told the boyfriend to protect him, the sister and mom are upset, and the person doesn't regret it. \n\nOn one hand, the person might think they did the right thing by being honest with their friend. They might believe that the boyfriend deserved to know the truth to avoid getting hurt. But on the other hand, interfering in a family matter like this can be complicated. Maybe they overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first, especially since it's a personal relationship. However, the sister's actions were dishonest, so the person might feel justified in exposing the cheating.\n\nThe consequences are that the family is angry, and the person is dealing with harassment from their sister and mom. The boyfriend was thankful but hurt. So, there's a mix of outcomes. The person's actions led to the breakup but also caused family tensions. \n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, it's a tough call. If the sister was indeed cheating, then the person might not be wrong for protecting their friend. But by not perhaps giving the sister a chance to address it herself, or without consulting her first, maybe they did overstep. However, the sister's behavior was unethical, so the person's action could be seen as a necessary intervention. \n\nBut in terms of family dynamics, maybe the person should have handled it differently. However, given the sister's pattern, maybe it was the right move. So the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
