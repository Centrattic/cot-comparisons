  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is a woman who was given a male name, \"John,\" after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and now wants to change her name to a nickname that her friends use, which is derived from her current last name. Her mom is against it, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. She's considering changing both first and last names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The person's right to choose their name is important. Names are personal and can affect someone's identity and well-being. If she's been made fun of and is now in a stable relationship where her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, that supports her desire to change. On the other hand, her parents named her after a family member, which might have sentimental value. The mom's disapproval is hurtful, but does the daughter have the right to make this change regardless?\n\nLegal aspect: In many places, adults can legally change their names. So there's no legal wrongdoing. Ethically, it's about personal autonomy versus family legacy. The daughter's well-being versus honoring family memory. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's rights as an adult to choose her identity are also significant. If the daughter is happy and this change is important for her self-identity and relationships, then she's not in the wrong. The key is whether her decision is respectful and her own choice. Since she's 21 and engaged, she's an adult, so the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
