My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Their parents named them after their grandfather, a male name, and they've been getting teased for it. They want to change to a female nickname based on their last name, which friends use. Their mom is upset and thinks they're disrespecting the grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They've been mocked for their name, which is a valid reason for wanting to change it for their own mental health and comfort. The name is male and doesn't have a female equivalent, leading to teasing. That's a lot to deal with, especially if it's affected their school experience.\n\nThe parent's side is about honoring the grandfather's memory. But the person is using a nickname that's been part of their identity. They've used it socially for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. It seems like changing the name is about personal identity and happiness now, not just a whim. The parent's reaction is strong, but can they override the person's choice now that they're an adult?\n\nLegally, adults can change their names as long as it's not for fraudulent purposes. So the author has the right to do this. Ethically, it's about respecting their own identity versus the parent's wishes. While the parent's feelings are important, the author's well-being and personal identity might take precedence. The grandfather's memory isn't being erased; the original name is still part of their history. The change is about how they present themselves now.\n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons and the right to make this choice.\n"
