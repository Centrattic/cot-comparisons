My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name their parents gave them, which was after their grandfather. They want to use a nickname based on their last name instead. Their mom is upset and thinks they're dishonoring their grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person's name is a male name, which they've been teased for, and they've used a nickname for years. They're changing both first and last names, which includes adopting the nickname as their legal name. Their parents didn't use the female version of the grandfather's name, so the name feels forced. The mother is against it, but the person feels the nickname is more authentic to them now.\n\nChanging one's name is a personal choice, especially when it affects their well-being. Being teased for a name that doesn't fit can lead to emotional distress. The fact that they've used the nickname socially for a long time suggests it's part of their identity. The mother's disapproval is a family concern, but the individual's right to self-identify is important. The grandfather's memory is mentioned, but the original name wasn't a match for the person's gender, so changing it isn't necessarily disrespectful\u2014it's about personal authenticity.\n\nIn many cultures, name changes are allowed if they're for valid reasons like gender identity or personal preference. The user is not denying the grandfather's influence but finding a name that fits them better. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows support from their partner. The mother's reaction is hurtful, but the individual's right to choose their name should be respected.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because it's their right to choose a name that aligns with their identity and comfort, especially after years of using a nickname and facing teasing. The mother's feelings are valid, but the user isn't obligated to maintain a name that doesn't feel authentic.\n"
