My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate for them. Their parents gave them a name after their grandfather, which is a boy's name, and they've been teased for it. They want to change both their first and last name to the nickname their friends use. Their mom is upset and thinks they're dishonoring the grandfather. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of individuals to change their names. In many places, you can legally change your name as an adult if you want. The user is 21, so they're an adult. The name was given by parents, but the person has the right to choose their own name as they grow up. The fact that they've been teased and are using a nickname already suggests that the current name isn't working for them socially.\n\nThe mom's argument is about forgoing the grandfather's memory. But the user isn't erasing the name; they're just not using it as their legal name any more. The name change is personal and for their well-being. Also, the nickname is derived from their current last name, so there's a connection still.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which indicates that this name is important in their personal and romantic life. The user's right to self-identify their name is significant. While family feelings are important, the user's autonomy and happiness should be considered. The mom's disapproval is hurtful, but the user isn't in the wrong for making a choice that affects their own life. So, the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
