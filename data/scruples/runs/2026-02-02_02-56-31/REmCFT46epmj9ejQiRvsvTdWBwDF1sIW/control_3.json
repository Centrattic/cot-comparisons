My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, which is a nickname that friends use. Their parents gave them a name after their grandfather, which is a male name like John. The person has been teased in school because of it, and now that they're 21 and engaged, they want to legally change both their first and last names. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're disrespecting the grandfather's memory.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the person's name is a male name, which is named after their grandfather. But they've always used a female nickname. The problem is that the original name doesn't have a girly nickname, so they were teased. Now they want to legally change their name to the nickname version, which is a female name. The parents, especially the mom, are against it, thinking it's disrespecting the grandfather.\n\nFrom a personal autonomy perspective, once you're an adult, you have the right to make decisions about your own name. The person is 21, so they're legally an adult. Changing your name is a common practice for various reasons, including gender identity, personal preference, to escape a harmful name, or to better reflect how you want to be known. In this case, the name has caused them distress and teasing. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which reinforces that they've been using it for a long time. So, the argument for B (not in the wrong) is strong here.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is upset because they're changing the name that was given in honor of the grandfather. The person is changing both first and last names. The grandfather's name being a male name might be a point of contention. However, the original name is a male name with no female counterpart, so the parents didn't adjust it, which might have contributed to the issue. The person is trying to align their name with their identity and how they present themselves socially. The mother's disapproval could be seen as not respecting the person's autonomy, especially as an adult.\n\nAnother angle: Cultural or family traditions. If the name is a family tradition, changing it might be seen as disrespectful. But again, the person has been using the nickname for a long time, and the name caused them negative experiences. The balance between respecting family wishes and personal identity is tricky, but many would argue that personal identity and well-being are more important once someone is an adult.\n\nLegally, in most places, you can change your name as long as you're not doing it for fraudulent reasons. So the author isn't in the wrong legally. Morally, it's about personal choice versus family expectations. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author's right to self-identify is a significant factor. The fact that they've been using the nickname for years and it's causing them distress supports their decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to change their name to better reflect their identity and to stop the teasing and discomfort they've experienced.\n"
