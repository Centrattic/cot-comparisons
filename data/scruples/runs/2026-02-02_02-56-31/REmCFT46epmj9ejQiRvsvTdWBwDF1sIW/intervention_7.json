  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a girl named after her grandfather with a male name like John. Her parents gave her a name that's typically for boys, which she's been teased about. Now she's 21 and wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she doesn't approve and thinks she's forgetting her grandfather. The question is whether she's in the wrong for going ahead with the name change despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, the user is an adult. At 21, she's of age, so personal decisions about her identity are hers to make. The name was given by her parents, but it's not serving her well. Being teased is a valid concern; names can affect self-esteem and social interactions. She's using the nickname already in social settings, which suggests it's been part of her identity for a while. Her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which might indicate it's a significant part of her identity now.\n\nHer mother's disapproval is about tradition and honoring her grandfather. But the user's well-being and personal identity might take precedence over tradition, especially if the name has caused her distress. The fact that the parents didn't give a female version of the name could be a point here. Maybe they didn't consider the implications of a male name for a daughter, which could be a cultural or personal oversight.\n\nChanging one's name is a personal choice. As long as it's legal and she's not causing harm to others, it's her right. The mother's feelings are valid, but the user also has the right to her own identity. The key points are her autonomy, the impact of the name on her life, and the fact that she's in a committed relationship where her chosen name is accepted.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong), because she's making a decision that aligns with her identity and well-being, even if it upsets her mother. Family disapproval is tough, but personal autonomy is important, especially regarding one's name.\n"
