My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. They're a girl who was given a male name, John, by her parents, named after her grandfather. She's been teased for it in school and now wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom doesn't approve, feels she's disrespecting her grandfather, and would be really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is an adult, 21 years old, and engaged. At that age, she has the legal right to change her name if she wants. So, the right to self-identify is important here. The name she was given doesn't suit her gender identity, leading to bullying and a sense of disconnection. That's a significant issue because being true to oneself is usually seen as important, especially when it affects well-being.\n\nHer parents named her after her grandfather, which was a meaningful gesture. But the author didn't get the female version of the name, so it's a mismatch. The nickname she's using has been her social name for a long time, and even her fianc\u00e9 uses it. That suggests she's been living with this name for years, and others recognize her by it. Changing her legal name to match her identity could help her feel more authentic and avoid future issues, like being misgendered or facing continued mockery.\n\nOn the other hand, her mom is upset because she feels the author is rejecting her grandfather's memory. This is about family respect and honoring ancestors. However, the author is not erasing the name; she's just changing her legal name. She can still honor her grandfather in other ways, like keeping the nickname as a tribute or using his name in different contexts. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author's right to choose her name as an adult is also valid.\n\nAnother angle: Name changes aren't uncommon when someone wants to align their identity. If the original name is causing her distress and she's found a name that feels more like hers, that's a strong personal reason. The mother's reaction is emotional, but it's the author's life and identity at stake. The key here is balancing personal identity with family feelings. However, the author isn't forcing the name change on her family; she's making a personal choice. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. It's her right to choose, and she's already using the nickname socially. Changing her legal name to reflect her true self is a reasonable decision, even if it causes family tension.\n"
