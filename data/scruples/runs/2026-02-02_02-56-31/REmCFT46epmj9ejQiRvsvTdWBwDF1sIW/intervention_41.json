My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for wanting to change their name. They were given a male name, which they don't like because it's been a source of teasing. They want to change both first and last names to a nickname that feels more like them, especially since they're engaged and the fianc\u00e9 uses that name. Their mom is against it, saying they're dishonoring their grandfather.\n\nHmm. First, the right to change one's name is a personal choice, right? The name was given by parents, but as an adult, they have the autonomy. The fact that the name has been a source of bullying and that they've used the nickname socially supports their desire to change. The mom's disapproval is tough, but it's about the user's identity and comfort. Also, the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, so changing legally would align with their personal identity and relationships. The grandfather's memory is part of the name, but the user is not erasing him; they're just choosing a different name for themselves. So probably, the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
