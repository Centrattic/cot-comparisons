My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from one that's a male name (like John) to a nickname that's more female and based on their last name. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but didn't use the female version. The person has been teased for the name in school and now that they're 21 and engaged, they want to change both first and last names. Their mom is upset, saying they're forsaking their grandfather's memory and won't accept the new name. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nSo, the main points here: the name was a male name given to a girl without a female equivalent, leading to teasing. The person has used the nickname socially for a long time. They're an adult now, so they have the legal right to change their name. The mother is upset about honoring the grandfather. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, adults can change their names if they choose. The reasons given (being teased, personal identity) are valid. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person's autonomy is their own. However, the emotional aspect of the grandfather's memory is a point of conflict. But the person isn't erasing the grandfather entirely; they're changing their name, not necessarily rejecting the family history. The nickname has been used by friends and fianc\u00e9, indicating it's a part of their identity now.\n\nSo, considering personal autonomy, emotional well-being, and the fact that name changes are legal for adults, the person isn't in the wrong. The mother's feelings are valid, but the decision to change the name is the individual's to make. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
