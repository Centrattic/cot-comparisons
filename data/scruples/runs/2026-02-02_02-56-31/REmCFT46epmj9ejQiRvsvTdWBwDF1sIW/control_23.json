My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to change her name from a male name like \"John\" to a nickname based on her last name. The parents gave her the name after her grandpa, but it's a boy's name, and she's been mocked for it. She's 21, engaged, and wants to legally change both her first and last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandpa's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The name issue has caused her lifelong teasing, which is significant. She's been using the nickname socially for a long time, even with her fianc\u00e9, so it's part of her identity now. The parents chose a name with a specific meaning (honoring her grandpa), but didn't adjust it for a female version. Now she's an adult and wants to change her legal name to her preferred nickname. The mom's disapproval is causing conflict.\n\nLegally, in most places, adults can change their names without parental consent. So from a legal standpoint, she has the right to do this. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially. The parents might feel hurt or disrespected, but at the same time, the person is seeking to resolve personal distress and social issues caused by her name. Her reasoning is that the nickname is her real name now, and she's happy with it. The conflict between honoring family tradition and individual identity is central here.\n\nIn these kinds of AITA scenarios, the common themes are autonomy versus family expectations. Since she's an adult, her autonomy is a strong point. The parents have done what they could by naming her, but the name's consequences are affecting her well-being. The fact that she's considering her fianc\u00e9's input and already uses the nickname socially supports her case. However, the mother's feelings are valid too, but they shouldn't override the adult child's right to self-identify.\n\nSo, putting it together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice that affects her life, and while it's understandable the parents are upset, it's her decision to make. The answer should be B.\n"
