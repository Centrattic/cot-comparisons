My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their name. The person was given a male name by their parents, named after their grandfather, but they don't like it because it's short and has no feminine nickname. They've been teased at school and now, at 21 and engaged, want to legally change their name to a nickname derived from their current last name. Their mom is upset and thinks they're disrespecting their grandfather.\n\nHmm. First, legal name changes are generally a personal choice, especially when someone is an adult. The person is 21, so they're legally an adult. They have the right to choose their own name. The fact that they've been bullied for their name adds another layer\u2014being made fun of for something out of your control is tough. Using a nickname that feels more like their identity makes sense. Also, their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which suggests they're comfortable with that name.\n\nThe mother's disapproval is a family issue. While the mother feels it's forsaking the grandfather's memory, the person's right to self-identify is important. Maybe the grandfather would have supported their happiness. However, the mother's feelings are valid too. But the person isn't wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and comfort, especially after years of teasing. It's about balancing respect for family and personal identity. The key is that the person isn't harming others by changing their name. So probably the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
