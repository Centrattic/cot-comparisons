My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for changing their name. The scenario is that the author was given a male name (like \"John\") by their parents, who named them after their grandfather. The author has been teased for this name and now wants to legally change both their first and last names to a nickname derived from their current last name. The parents disapprove, especially the mom, who feels it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, names are significant and changing them can be seen as disrespectful to family traditions. The parents might feel that the author is rejecting the family's naming choice. However, the author has been dealing with teasing and personal discomfort, which affects their self-esteem and social interactions. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which suggests the new name is more aligned with how the author identifies and is perceived socially.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, in many places, adults can legally change their names without needing permission. So the author has the legal right to do so. The mother's disapproval is a personal grievance but doesn't override the author's right to self-identify. The key points are autonomy versus family tradition. The author's well-being and personal identity are important, especially if the current name causes ongoing distress.\n\nThe mother's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is dishonoring the grandfather. But the author's reasoning is that the name wasn't adapted for a female, leading to a mismatch. The nickname is already a common way the author is known, so changing it legally makes sense for consistency. \n\nI think the answer here leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They have the right to choose their name, especially if it improves their quality of life. While the parents' feelings are valid, the author's autonomy and personal happiness are also significant. The mother's disapproval is hurtful but doesn't make the author at fault. So the answer should be B.\n"
