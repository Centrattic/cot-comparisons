My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman named after her grandfather with a male name, which she's been teased for. She wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname her friends use, which is derived from her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is a personal choice. The fact that the original name was a male name given to her by her parents doesn't inherently bind her to keep it, especially if it's causing her distress. The nickname she's using is already a version of her current last name, so changing her last name to that nickname makes sense. She mentioned that she's always used the nickname socially, and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too. That suggests she's comfortable with it and it's part of her identity now.\n\nHer mother's disapproval is based on the idea that she's honoring her grandfather by keeping the name. But the grandfather's name was male, so maybe the mother didn't consider a female equivalent. However, the daughter's right to choose a name that fits her identity is important. The mother's objection seems more about tradition and her own feelings than the daughter's well-being. Legal name changes are typically allowed unless there's fraud or other issues, so the daughter isn't in the wrong here. She's reclaiming her identity and addressing past teasing. The answer is B.\n"
