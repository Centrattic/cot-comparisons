  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is a girl named after her grandpa, who has a boy's name like John. She's being teased for it and wants to change her name to a nickname that she's used in social settings. Her mom is upset, thinking she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. People often have the right to choose their names, especially if they feel it's important for their identity. She's 21, an adult, so it's her decision. But the family aspect comes into play. Her parents gave her the name, and she's changing it, which might hurt their feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, she's dealing with bullying and her current name doesn't fit her. Changing her name could be a way to reclaim her identity. The nickname is already used by friends and her fianc\u00e9, so it's part of her identity now. But her mom's reaction is strong, saying she won't accept the new name. That could affect their relationship.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Legally, she can change her name as an adult. Emotionally, her mom is hurt. But the question is about being in the wrong. If she's prioritizing her own well-being and identity over her family's feelings, is that wrong? Some might say she's standing up for herself, others might say she's being selfish.\n\nBut since she's adult and making her own choices, maybe she's not in the wrong. The parents can be disappointed, but she doesn't owe them her name if she feels it's causing her distress. The key points are her well-being vs. family ties. I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
