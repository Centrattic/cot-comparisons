My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a girl who was given a male name after her grandfather, a name like \"John\" with no female equivalent. She's been teased for it in school, and now she's 21 and engaged. She wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her last name that friends use. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory and won't accept the new name.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to change her name despite her mom's disapproval. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The name was given by parents as a tribute to her grandfather, but it's causing her distress and social issues. She's been using a nickname for years, and her fianc\u00e9 uses that. Changing the name would align her legal name with how she's known socially. At 21, she's an adult with autonomy. Her mom's reaction is about honoring the grandfather, but the daughter's well-being is also important.\n\nIn many cultures, especially Western ones, changing one's name is a personal choice once you're an adult. The parents gave her the name, but once she's grown, she can choose to change it if it's causing her harm. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the daughter's right to self-identify might outweigh that. The fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time suggests she's tried to live with the name as much as possible. The teasing in school is another factor indicating the name has had a negative impact on her life.\n\nThe mother's argument is about honoring the grandfather, but the daughter's decision could be seen as a way to honor her own identity and mental health. It's a balance between respecting family traditions and individual rights. Since she's an adult, her autonomy is a strong point. The fianc\u00e9's support for the new name also shows that it's a meaningful change for her in her personal life.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the daughter isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice that affects her daily life and happiness. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's right to choose her name is her own. The answer should be B.\n"
