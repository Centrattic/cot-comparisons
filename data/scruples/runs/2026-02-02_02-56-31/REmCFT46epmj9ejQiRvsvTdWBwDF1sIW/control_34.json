I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for changing her name. Let's start by understanding the situation. She was given a male name by her parents, which is a short name like \"John\" without a feminine version. They named her after her grandfather, but she's been teased for it throughout school. Now that she's 21 and engaged, she wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname that her friends have used, which is based on her current last name. Her mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, thinking she's dishonoring her grandfather.\n\nFirst, the key points: she's an adult, the name was given by her parents but it's causing her distress. She's been teased, which is a valid reason for wanting to change. Her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, so it's already in use. The mom is upset about honoring the grandfather, but the author feels the nickname is more her identity. \n\nIn terms of ethics, when someone is a grown adult, they generally have the right to make decisions about their own name. The parents gave her a name that isn't suitable for her gender, leading to bullying. The author isn't changing her name out of spite but because it's affecting her well-being. The mother's disapproval is based on tradition, but the author's happiness and comfort are also important. \n\nCulturally, there are varying views on name changes. Some might see it as respecting family tradition, others as personal choice. Since she's in a committed relationship and using the nickname already, changing it makes sense. The grandfather's memory is honored through the original name, but the author is reclaiming her identity. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, she can change her name as an adult. Emotionally, she's dealing with past trauma of being teased. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author's right to self-identify is also important. The mother's disapproval might be seen as selfish if she's not considering the daughter's well-being. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's making a personal choice that affects her own life, and her reasons are valid. The mother's reaction is unfortunate, but the daughter isn't wrong for prioritizing her own comfort and identity.\n"
