  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman whose parents gave her a male name, specifically \"John,\" after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and now wants to legally change her name to a nickname derived from her current last name, which she's used socially and with her fianc\u00e9. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The question is whether she's in the wrong for going through with the name change despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the individual's right to choose their name. Adults have the legal right to change their names in most places. Using a name that feels authentic to oneself is important for identity and well-being. The fact that she's been teased for years suggests that the current name has caused her distress, which is a valid reason for wanting to change it. The nickname has been her social name for a long time, so it's likely her preferred name. Her fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows that those close to her accept it.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's perspective is about honoring the grandfather's memory. However, while the grandfather is being remembered, the person is the one living with the name. The original name might have been a gesture from her parents, but the individual has the right to make decisions about her identity. Disapproval from family members is a common issue in name changes, but it doesn't necessarily make the decision wrong. The key points are her autonomy, her well-being, and the fact that she's making this choice at 21, an adult age. The mother's reaction, while hurtful, doesn't override the individual's right to self-identify. Therefore, it's more about her personal rights versus her family's expectations. Since she's making a decision that benefits her and she's legally allowed to do so, she's not in the wrong.\n"
