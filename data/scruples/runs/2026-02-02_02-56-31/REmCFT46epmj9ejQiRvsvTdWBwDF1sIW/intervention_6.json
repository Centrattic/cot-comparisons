My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a girl who was given a boy's name, \"John,\" by her parents in honor of her grandfather. She's being teased for it and wants to change both her first and last names to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks she's dishonoring her grandpa. The user is 21, engaged, and her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is a personal choice. In many places, legal name changes are allowed as long as you follow the process. The parents gave her a name that doesn't fit her gender identity or personal preference, leading to teasing. She's been using the nickname socially for a long time, so it's become her identity. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which suggests her partner supports her. \n\nHer mom's resistance is about tradition and honoring the grandfather. But the user is an adult now, so while family opinions matter, they don't have final say over her identity. The key here is her well-being versus the family's feelings. Since she's facing social issues and the name doesn't align with her identity, changing it seems justified. The parents might be in the right for wanting to honor their ancestor, but the user's right to self-identify takes precedence here. So, answer B.\n"
