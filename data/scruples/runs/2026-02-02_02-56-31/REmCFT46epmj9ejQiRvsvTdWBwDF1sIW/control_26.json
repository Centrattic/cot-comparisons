My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. The situation is that she was given a male name (like John) by her parents, which is a tribute to her grandfather. She's been teased for it and wants to change it to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate and what she's been called by friends and her fianc\u00e9. Her mom is upset and disapproves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person is an adult, 21, which is old enough to make her own decisions. She's been using the nickname for a long time, and it's important to her identity. The parents named her after her grandfather, but didn't use the female version. The mother is upset because she feels she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. However, the person in question is now making a choice that affects her own life, including her marriage. \n\nLegally, she has the right to change her name if she's an adult. Socially, people often do name changes for various reasons, including personal identity. The mother's disapproval is a personal issue, but the daughter's autonomy is a factor here. The fact that she's facing mockery and the name causes her distress adds to the justification. Also, her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which suggests that changing her name to align with her identity and relationship is a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's feelings about honoring the grandfather might be hurt. But the daughter's happiness and well-being are also important. The parents named her with a certain intention, but once someone is an adult, changing their name to better fit their identity is a common and accepted practice in many cultures. The mother's disapproval might lead to a rift, but the daughter isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing her own needs and happiness.\n\nSo the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's making a personal choice as an adult to align her name with her identity, which has been a source of distress. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's autonomy and well-being are key here.\n"
