My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name. Their original name is a male name, \"John,\" given by their parents to honor their grandfather. They've been teased for it in school and now want to change both their first and last names to a nickname based on their current last name. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, thinking they're dishonoring their grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They've been made fun of, which is a valid reason for wanting a name change. They've used the nickname socially for a long time, so it feels more like their own name. Their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which shows it's important to their personal identity. Name changes can be about personal identity and comfort, which is a significant aspect of self-determination.\n\nOn the other side, the parents chose the name to honor their grandfather. The mother is upset because she feels the new name forsakes his memory. However, the person isn't removing the grandfather's name entirely; they're changing their first name but keeping the last name modified. The original name was a male name given to a girl without a female equivalent, which might have been an oversight. The person isn't rejecting the family history entirely\u2014they're creating a new identity that still ties into their family, just in a different way.\n\nLegally, people can change their names for various reasons, including personal preference. The mother's disapproval is a family issue, but the person is an adult and has the right to make decisions about their own name. The question is whether they're in the wrong for doing so despite their mother's wishes. Since the mother isn't being harmed, just upset, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own well-being and identity, which is important.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the mother's feelings are significant, but the person is also within their rights. The name change is about their own identity and happiness. The fact that they've used the nickname for years suggests it's a natural evolution. The mother's disapproval is a personal conflict but doesn't necessarily make the person wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
