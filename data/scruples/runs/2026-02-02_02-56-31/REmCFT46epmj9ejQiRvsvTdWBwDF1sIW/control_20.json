My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, which was given in honor of their grandfather. The parents didn't use the female version, so the name is like \"John,\" a short male name with no girly nickname. The person has been teased for it and wants to change both first and last names to a nickname derived from their last name. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person is an adult, 21 and engaged. They've been using a nickname for a long time. The name was originally their grandfather's, given by parents who didn't provide a female alternative. The person is changing the name to something that feels more authentic to them, which is important for their identity. The parents disapprove, but the person is going ahead anyway.\n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, legally, in many places, adults can change their names without needing parental approval. So the act of changing the name might not be wrong. The moral aspect is trickier. The parents feel it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. But the person has been using the nickname for a long time, which suggests that this change isn't just a whim but a long-standing part of their identity. The parent's disapproval is based on sentiment, but the person's well-being and identity are also important.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the author is wrong for not respecting the parents' wishes. If B, then the author is not wrong because they're asserting their identity and the name change is their right as an adult.\n\nConsidering the context, the author has been using the nickname socially, which might indicate that the change is more about authenticity than rebellion. The parents' reaction is emotional, but the author's choice affects their own life. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
