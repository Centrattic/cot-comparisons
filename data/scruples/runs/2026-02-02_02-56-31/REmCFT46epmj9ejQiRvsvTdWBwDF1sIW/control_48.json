My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, especially since their parents named them after their grandfather. The name is a short, masculine name like John, which has caused teasing. Now they're 21 and want to legally change their name to a nickname derived from their last name, which their friends use. Their mom is upset and thinks they're dishonoring their grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person is an adult, 21 and engaged, which means they have the legal right to make their own decisions about their name. The original name was given by their parents, but the individual feels it doesn't represent them, especially since it's a male name without a female equivalent. They've used a nickname all along, which their friends and fianc\u00e9 use, so the change is about personal identity and comfort.\n\nThe mother's disapproval is based on honoring the grandfather's memory. But does the person have an obligation to keep a name they find problematic? Since they're an adult, the right to choose a name is generally their own. The fact that the name has caused them distress and teasing in school adds to the argument that changing it is a valid choice for their well-being.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong (A) or not (B). The factors here are personal autonomy, the impact of the name on their life, and respect for family history. While the mother's feelings are important, the individual's right to self-identify with a name they feel is their own seems to outweigh the disapproval. Plus, the nickname is already used in social contexts, so the legal change is just formalizing that identity.\n\nSo the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
