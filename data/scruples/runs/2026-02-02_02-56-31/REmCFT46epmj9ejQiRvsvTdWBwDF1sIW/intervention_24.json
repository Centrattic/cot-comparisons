My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname-based name. Their parents named them after their grandpa, a male name, and the user has been teased for it. Now they're 21 and want to change both their first and last name to the nickname their friends use. Their mom is upset, saying they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person is an adult, which is a big factor. At 21, they can make their own decisions about their name. The original name was a male name with no female equivalent, leading to teasing. The desire to change it is partly about personal identity and comfort. The nickname has been used by friends and family, including the fianc\u00e9, so it's something that's been part of their social identity for a while.\n\nThe mom's objection is about honoring the grandfather. But is it the person's responsibility to continue using a name that causes them distress just to honor a family member? The grandfather is deceased, so his direct approval isn't a factor. The parents chose the name, but the child is now an adult and has the right to choose their own name. The mom's disapproval might stem from feeling that the child is rejecting the grandfather's memory, but the child might see it as finding a name that fits them better.\n\nAlso, the name change is for both first and last names, which is a significant step. The fact that they've used the nickname socially for so long suggests that this is a long-standing desire, not a sudden impulse. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname also indicates that it's part of their personal identity now.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people change their names for various reasons\u2014marriage, personal identity, cultural reasons. The key here is autonomy. Since the person is an adult, they have the legal right to change their name. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person's own well-being and identity should be considered. The teasing and bullying they faced could have a lasting impact, and changing the name might help them feel more comfortable in their own skin.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose their name, especially if it's causing them harm and they've used the nickname as their social name for years. The mother's feelings are valid, but the person's autonomy is more important here.\n"
