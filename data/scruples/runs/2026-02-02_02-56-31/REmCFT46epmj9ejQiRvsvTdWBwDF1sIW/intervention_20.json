My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname-based name. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but the name doesn't have a female version. They've been teased in school, and now they're 21 and engaged, wanting to change both their first and last name to a nickname their friends use. Their mom is upset, saying it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They\u2019ve been teased for their name, which is a valid issue. Being comfortable with your name is important for self-esteem and happiness, especially since they've always used the nickname. At 21, they\u2019re an adult, so the right to make personal decisions is a factor. The parents\u2019 disapproval is significant, but adult children can make their own choices even if family is upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents named them in memory of the grandfather, which is a meaningful gesture. Changing the name might hurt the parents\u2019 feelings, but the user's well-being is also important. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, so there's support from their partner. The key points are autonomy, the impact of bullying, and respect for family wishes. The user is seeking validation for their choice despite family disapproval. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because it's their right to choose their name, especially for their own comfort and identity.\n"
