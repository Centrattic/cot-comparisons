My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname based on their last name. Their parents gave them the name after their grandpa, but it's a boy's name and they've been teased for it. They're 21 and engaged, wanting to use the nickname that friends and their fianc\u00e9 use. Their mom is upset, saying it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, name changes are personal. The user is an adult now, so they have the legal right to change their name. The parents gave them a name that's causing them distress, especially with being teased. The fact that they've used the nickname socially for a long time shows it's important to their identity. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname also supports that they're comfortable with it. The mom's disapproval is emotional, but the author has the right to choose their name. It's about self-identity and personal happiness. The grandfather's memory is part of the name, but the author isn't erasing it; they're choosing a name that fits them better. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
