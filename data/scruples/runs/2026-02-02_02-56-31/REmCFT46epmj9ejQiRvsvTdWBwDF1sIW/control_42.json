My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname based on their last name. Their parents gave them the name after their grandfather, but it's a male name with no female version. The person has been teased for it and wants to change both their first and last names. Their mom doesn't approve and says she won't accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They were given a name that doesn't fit their gender and has caused them distress. Using a nickname that they feel is more authentic makes sense for their identity and happiness. Changing one's name is a common way people align their identity with their true self, especially when facing social challenges.\n\nThe parents' perspective is about honoring the grandfather's memory. But the person's well-being is also important. The fact that they've used the nickname socially and even the fianc\u00e9 uses it suggests it's their preferred identity. The mother's disapproval is a conflict, but the person has the right to choose their name, especially as an adult. \n\nLegal name changes are typically allowed for such reasons. The key here is autonomy versus family tradition. While family feelings matter, the individual's right to self-identify is significant. There's no indication of malice; it's about personal identity and comfort. So, the answer would likely be that they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
