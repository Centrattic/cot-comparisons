My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. Her parents gave her a male name, which she's been teased for. Now she wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname her friends use. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her reasons. She mentions being teased throughout school, which is a valid concern. People should have the right to choose a name that makes them feel comfortable. Also, she's been using a nickname for a long time, and her fianc\u00e9 uses it. That suggests the nickname is significant to her identity now.\n\nHer parents named her after her grandfather, which she appreciates the gesture. But she points out they didn't use the female version of the name. That might be an oversight. The name \"John\" is typically male, so maybe they didn't realize the implications. Now, she wants to take control of her identity, which is a personal choice.\n\nThe mother's reaction is about honoring the grandfather. However, the daughter's well-being and self-acceptance might be more important. While respecting family tradition is important, it shouldn't override someone's personal needs. The mother's disapproval doesn't make the daughter wrong in seeking change.\n\nAlso, she's an adult now, so she has the autonomy to make decisions about her own name. The fact that she's engaged and wants to use the nickname as her official name shows she's thought this through. Her parents' disapproval might be hurtful, but that doesn't mean she's in the wrong. People can disagree without it affecting their responsibility to their own happiness.\n\nSo putting it all together: the daughter's reasons are valid, she's addressing her own identity and past trauma, and as an adult, she has the right to choose her name. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
