My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. The original name was given by the parents, named after the grandfather. The person is now 21 and wants to change both first and last names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The name is a short male name without a girly nickname, leading to teasing. The person has used a nickname for years, even the fianc\u00e9 uses it. The mother is upset, thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The key points are age (21, adult), personal identity, and family dynamics.\n\nIn many cultures, adults have the legal right to change their names. The person has been using the nickname socially for a long time, so it's part of their identity. The parents might feel hurt because the name is tied to family history, but the person's well-being and happiness are also important. The mother's disapproval is significant but not necessarily a reason to stop the name change. The question is whether the person is wrong for going ahead despite the mother's feelings. \n\nPossible arguments against the person: Disrespecting family tradition, causing emotional distress to parents. But arguments in favor: Right to self-identity, long-term use of nickname, adult decision. \n\nI think the balance here leans towards the person not being in the wrong. They're an adult, making a choice that aligns with their identity, and have faced ongoing issues with the original name. The mother's feelings are valid, but the person's autonomy is key. So answer B.\n"
