My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female nickname. Their parents named them after their grandfather, which they appreciate but find problematic because the name is short and male, leading to teasing. They want to legally change both first and last names to the nickname they've used socially. Their mom is upset, thinking they're dishonoring their grandfather.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the key points. The person's name was given by parents, but they're an adult now. They're changing their name to something that feels more like them, especially since the current name causes issues. The mother's reaction is about honoring the grandfather, but the person is choosing a nickname that's already been used. They're 21 and engaged, which adds to their desire for a name that feels authentic.\n\nLegally, in most places, adults can change their names without permission. So the right to change a name is there. The mother's disapproval is emotional, but does that make the person in the wrong? The person is prioritizing their own identity and well-being over the parents' wishes. While respecting family is important, so is personal autonomy.\n\nThe nickname has been used socially, so it's part of their identity. The mother's argument about the grandfather's memory might be more about tradition than the person's happiness. The person isn't rejecting the grandfather entirely but making a name change for practical and personal reasons. The teasing is a valid issue affecting their life. So the answer is likely B, not in the wrong. They have the right to choose their name, especially as an adult.\n"
