  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name to a nickname based on their last name. Their parents named them after their grandfather, which is a boy's name, and it's been a source of teasing. They're 21, engaged, and considering changing both first and last names. Their mom disapproves and says she'll never accept the new name. The person argues that they've always used the nickname and it feels more like their own name now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the individual versus family expectations. At 21, they're an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name. The parents' disapproval is a factor, but the person's personal identity and comfort are also important. The original name was given by the parents with a specific meaning, but the person is choosing a name that they feel represents themselves better. The teasing they've experienced adds to the justification for wanting a change for their own well-being.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 using the nickname suggests that the new name is already integrated into their personal and possibly professional life. While respecting the grandfather's memory is important, the person isn't erasing the name entirely but creating a new identity. It's a balance between honoring family traditions and personal autonomy. The mother's reaction is emotional, but the person has the right to make decisions about their own identity. Therefore, the person isn't in the wrong.\n"
