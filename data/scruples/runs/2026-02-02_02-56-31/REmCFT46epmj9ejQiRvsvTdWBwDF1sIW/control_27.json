My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname based on her last name. Her parents gave her a name after her grandfather, but she's been teased for it. Now she's considering changing both her first and last names, which upsets her mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The name was given with a good intention, honoring the grandfather. However, the individual is female and the name is a short male name without a female variant. She's been bullied for it, which is a significant factor. At 21, she's an adult, and the name change is about her identity and how she's perceived. Her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, and friends do too, so it's part of her self-identity now.\n\nHer mother's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather, but the daughter is trying to assert her own identity. The key points here are her autonomy as an adult, the impact of bullying, and the fact that the nickname is already widely used. \n\nLegally, in many places, adults can change their names without family consent. Ethically, the person has the right to choose their identity, especially when it affects their well-being. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's right to self-identify is also important. Since the name change is for her own comfort and to align with how she's known, it's a personal choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
