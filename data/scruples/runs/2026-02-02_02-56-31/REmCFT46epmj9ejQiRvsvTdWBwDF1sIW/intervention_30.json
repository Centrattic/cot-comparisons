My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a woman who was given a traditionally male name (like John) at birth, after her grandfather. Now she's 21 and engaged, planning to change both her first and last name to a nickname that her friends have always used. Her mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather.\n\nFirst, the core issue is about identity and autonomy. She's been using the nickname for a long time, and it's her preference now. The parents named her after her grandfather, but maybe they didn't consider the female equivalent. The user isn't rejecting her grandfather; she's using a nickname that's already associated with her. The mother's reaction seems to be about tradition or honoring the grandfather, but the user is choosing her own identity. \n\nChanging your name is a personal choice, especially when it's causing distress. The fact that she's been teased at school adds to the emotional impact. The mother's disapproval is a family issue, but she's an adult, so the decision is hers to make. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname supports her choice. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She has the right to choose her name, and changing it to align with her identity isn't forsaking her grandfather. The mother's disapproval is their problem, not hers.\n"
