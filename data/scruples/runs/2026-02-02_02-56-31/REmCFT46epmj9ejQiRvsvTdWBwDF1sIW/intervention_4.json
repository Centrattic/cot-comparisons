My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a female nickname that their friends have used for them. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but they feel the name doesn't fit them, especially since they're a girl. They've been teased at school and now, at 21 and engaged, they want to change both their first and last names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of an adult to make decisions about their own identity. In many places, adults have the legal right to change their names without needing permission from family members. The fact that they're 21 supports this\u2014they\u2019re an adult, so it's their choice. The nickname being used by friends and even their fianc\u00e9 suggests that this name is a better fit for how they want to be known.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The user mentions being teased, which can affect self-esteem and mental health. Changing a name can be an important step in aligning one's identity with their true self, which is a valid reason. The parents' disapproval is significant, but adult children don't need their parents' approval for major life decisions. The mother's argument about forsaking the grandfather's memory is a personal belief, but it doesn't override the individual's right to self-determination.\n\nHowever, I should also think about cultural or familial expectations. Some cultures place a high value on honoring ancestors through names, which might make the mother's perspective more complex. But even then, the individual has the right to their own identity. The key points here are autonomy, well-being, and the right to self-identify. The user isn't just changing a name for fun; it's about how they're perceived and feel comfortable in their own skin. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer should lean towards B, meaning they are not in the wrong. They're making a choice that affects their life and happiness, and while respecting their family's feelings is important, they\u2019re not obligated to let disapproval stop them.\n"
