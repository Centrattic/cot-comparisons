My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female nickname, given their parents named them after their grandfather. The main points here are the name's origin, the social impact (like being teased), and the parents' disapproval.\n\nFirst, the name was given by the parents, inspired by the grandfather. The user mentions they've been teased for it and prefer a nickname that's more gender-appropriate. They're 21 and engaged, so they're adults now. The parents are upset they're not keeping the grandfather's name, but the user feels the nickname is more their identity now.\n\nIn terms of rights, adults can legally change their names in many places. The parents' disapproval might be hurtful, but the user's right to self-identify is a factor. The grandfather's memory is important to the parents, but the user isn't erasing the name; they're just changing their own. The nickname has been used by friends and the fianc\u00e9, indicating it's part of their social identity.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their identity, and the parents' feelings, while valid, don't override the user's autonomy. The answer is B.\n"
