My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. She was given a male name by her parents, named after her grandfather, but she's been teased for it. She wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname her friends use, which is based on her last name. Her mom is upset and says she'll never accept the new name, thinking she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural aspects. In some cultures, changing one's name might be seen as disrespectful to family heritage. But in others, especially in modern Western contexts, people do change names for personal reasons. The key points here are the ongoing teasing she experienced and her desire to use a name that feels more like her own, especially since her fianc\u00e9 uses it. Her parents, particularly her mom, are against it, but she's an adult now. At 21, she has the legal right to make her own decisions. The fact that she's been using the nickname socially for a while suggests that this isn't a hasty decision. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but does that make the author wrong? The question is about whether she's in the wrong, not about the mother's reaction. Since she's an adult and the name change is about her own comfort and identity, it's more likely that she isn't in the wrong. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author's autonomy is also important. So the answer is B.\n"
