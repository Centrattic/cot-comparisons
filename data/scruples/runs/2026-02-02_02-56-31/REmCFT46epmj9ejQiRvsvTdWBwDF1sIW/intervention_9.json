  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate and commonly used by friends and their fianc\u00e9. The parents named them after their grandfather, and the user feels that the name is causing them distress because it's a short male name without a girly nickname. The mother is upset and thinks they're forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's rights to autonomy over their own name. They're an adult, 21 years old, so they have the legal right to change their name. The name change is about their identity and comfort. Being teased at school and wanting to use a name that feels more like their own is a valid reason. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname also suggests that the new name is integrated into their personal and possibly professional life.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents feel attached to the name as a tribute to their grandfather. Their disapproval is hurtful, but the user's well-being is also a factor. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for prioritizing their own identity and happiness over the family's tradition.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing. Socially, it's a personal choice. The user isn't harming anyone but themselves by changing the name. The parents might feel disrespected, but the user's right to self-identify is important. The answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because it's their right to choose their name for their own reasons.\n"
