  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a woman who was given a male name, \"John,\" by her parents as a tribute to her grandfather. She's being teased for it and wants to change her name to a nickname derived from her current last name, which she uses in social settings. Her mom is upset, saying she's dishonoring her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and personal aspects here. Legally, adults have the right to change their names, so she wouldn't be in the wrong legally. The question is more about moral or social responsibility. Her parents intended a tribute, but she's not getting the nickname they gave her. She's using the nickname in her daily life and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too. The mother's disapproval is emotional, feeling she's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nOn one hand, honoring family traditions and the memory of a grandparent is important. On the other hand, personal identity and the right to choose a name that feels authentic is also significant. The user is experiencing bullying due to her name, which adds to the justification for changing it for her well-being.\n\nHer mother's perspective is about maintaining family legacy, but the user's perspective is about personal identity and comfort. The key factors here are the impact on her mental health, her autonomy as an adult, and the fact that the nickname is already widely used. The mother's disapproval is emotional, but the user's decision is about her own identity. So, it's more about her right to choose her name over the family's disapproval. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
