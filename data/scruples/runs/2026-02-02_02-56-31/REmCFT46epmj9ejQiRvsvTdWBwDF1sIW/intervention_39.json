  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. The situation is about changing their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname that's more feminine. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but the user is a girl and the name isn't a female version. They've been teased at school, and now they want to change both their first and last names to the nickname their friends use. The mother is upset, thinks they're forsaking the grandfather's memory, and doesn't approve. The user is 21 and engaged, and their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, the user is an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name. That's a point. The name they were given isn't suitable for them, causing them distress and social issues. The fact that the nickname is already used by friends and the fianc\u00e9 suggests it's been part of their identity for a while. The parents' disapproval is strong, but the user is making a choice about their own identity. The argument from the parents is about honoring the grandfather, but the user's experience and well-being are also important. \n\nIn many cultures, changing your name as an adult is a personal choice. The parents might feel hurt, but the user isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and identity. The name change is to align with their gender and personal identity, which is a valid reason. However, the emotional impact on the parents is a factor. But since the user is an adult, the decision ultimately rests with them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice that affects their own life, and while it's considerate to acknowledge the parents' feelings, it's not obligatory to follow their wishes.\n"
