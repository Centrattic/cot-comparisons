My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is at fault. The situation is that she was given a male name by her parents, which they named after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and now wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the individual's right to self-identify. In many cultures, especially Western ones, people have the legal right to change their names for personal reasons. The fact that she's an adult and this has been a source of teasing for years is significant. Her motivation is to feel more comfortable and authentic, which is a valid personal choice. The mother's disapproval is based on family tradition and honoring her grandfather, but that doesn't necessarily override the individual's right to choose their own identity. The fianc\u00e9's acceptance also suggests that her new name is widely accepted in her current social circle. While the mother's feelings are important, they shouldn't dictate the daughter's personal identity, especially when it affects her well-being. The key points here are autonomy, personal identity, and the impact of societal judgment. The answer likely leans towards B, not being in the wrong.\n"
