My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. The situation is that she was given a male name by her parents, which is causing her issues, and she wants to use a nickname as her legal name now. Her mother is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name is a boy's name with no female equivalent, leading to teasing. The person has always used a nickname and is engaged now. Changing the name is about her identity and comfort. The mother is upset because it's a tribute to the grandfather, but the author feels the nickname is more hers.\n\nLegal name changes are generally allowed unless there's fraud or something. The mother's disapproval isn't a legal barrier. The author's right to self-identify is important. Even if the parents have a sentimental reason, the adult child can make this choice. The mother might be in the wrong for not respecting the daughter's identity. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and happiness. So, the answer is B.\n"
