My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The scenario is that the person, a woman, was given a boy's name (like John) by her parents, who named her after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and now wants to legally change her name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mother is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the individual's right to choose their name. Many people change their names for personal reasons, like gender identity, cultural identity, or just not liking their given name. The fact that she's been teased and has used the nickname socially for a long time suggests it's important to her well-being and self-identity.\n\nHer parents named her after her grandfather, which was a meaningful gesture, but she points out that they didn't use the female version of the name. That might mean the name wasn't intended as a boy's name originally. Still, changing the name could hurt the parents' feelings, especially since they see it as honoring the grandfather. But the person's autonomy is a key factor here. At 21, she's an adult, so she can make her own decisions. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname also shows that her new name is accepted in her personal life.\n\nThe mother's disapproval is significant, but does that make the person in the wrong? If she's changing her name to feel more comfortable and has the legal ability to do so, it's her right. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's choice is about her own identity and happiness. The humor or teasing she faced might have contributed to her decision, so it's about addressing past pain.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong. She's exercising her autonomy and choosing a name that aligns with how she presents herself, which is a common and accepted practice. The mother's disapproval doesn't override her right to do so. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
