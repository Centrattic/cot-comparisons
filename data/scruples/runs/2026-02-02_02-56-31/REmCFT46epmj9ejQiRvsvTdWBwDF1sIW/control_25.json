My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is a woman who was given a male name (like John) by her parents, which they named after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and wants to legally change her name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is against it, saying she doesn't want her to forsake her grandfather's memory. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author has a valid reason: being bullied for her name and wanting to use a name that feels more like hers. She's been using the nickname for a long time, even her fianc\u00e9 uses it. This could be about her identity and comfort. On the other hand, her parents chose the name with intention, honoring her grandfather. The mother's reaction is about respecting that memory, which she sees as being dishonored by changing the name.\n\nBut legally, in many places, adults can change their names without family approval. The emotional aspect is about personal identity versus family legacy. The author isn't trying to erase the grandfather entirely; she's just changing her own name. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but does that make the author in the wrong? If the name change is about her well-being and self-identity, most people would side with her. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author has the right to choose her name, especially as an adult. So, probably answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
