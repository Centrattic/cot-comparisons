My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for wanting to legally change their name from a male name to a female one, which is a nickname based on their last name. The parents named them after their grandfather, a male name, and now the person is 21 and wants to change both their first and last names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person was given a name that doesn't fit their gender identity, leading to being teased. They want to use a nickname they've always gone by, which is more gender-appropriate. Their mother is upset, thinking they're forsaking the grandfather's memory. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for going ahead with the name change despite the mother's disapproval.\n\nLegally, in most places, adults can change their names without needing permission from family. So the person has the right to do this. The main ethical question is about respecting family feelings versus personal identity. The person has been using the nickname for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. This suggests that the new name is important to their identity and well-being. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but adults can make decisions about their own lives, even if it upsets family. The fact that the original name was a male name with no female equivalent complicates things. The grandfather's memory is important, but the person's identity is also crucial. It's a balance between honoring family and respecting one's self. Since the person is an adult, their autonomy is key here. So the answer would likely be that they're not in the wrong (B), as they have the right to choose their name for their own well-being, even if it upsets their parents.\n"
