My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname they've used for years. The parents gave the name in honor of the grandfather, but the person feels it's a boy's name and has been teased for it. They want to change both their first and last name to their nickname, which is based on their current last name. The mom is upset, says she'll never accept the new name and that the person is forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if changing one's name is a valid reason here. The person is an adult, 21, so they have the legal right to change their name. The parents gave a name that they now feel doesn't fit their identity. The fact that the nickname has been used by friends and even the fianc\u00e9 suggests it's a well-established alternative. The parent's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather, but the person feels the original name was problematic for them socially.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and identity versus family tradition. The person is asserting their right to self-identify with a name they feel more comfortable in, especially since they're an adult. The parent's disapproval is strong, but the person's well-being and comfort are also important. The nickname being based on the original last name might mitigate the issue of completely discarding the family name, but the first name change is more about personal identity.\n\nI think the person isn't in the wrong here. They have the right to choose their name as an adult, especially if it helps them feel more authentic and accepted. The parent's feelings are valid, but the child's autonomy should take precedence. The fact that the change isn't entirely abandoning the family name (since the last name is modified) might help. Also, the social impact of being teased is a real issue to consider. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
