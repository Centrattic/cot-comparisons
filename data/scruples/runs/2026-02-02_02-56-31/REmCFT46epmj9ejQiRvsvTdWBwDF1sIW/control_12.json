My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The situation is that the author was given a male name by their parents, named after their grandfather, but they feel it's not suitable for them as a girl. They've been teased for it, and now they're 21 and considering changing both their first and last name to a nickname they've used. Their mom is upset, thinking they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person's name is a male name with no female equivalent, leading to teasing. They've used a nickname so much that it's become their identity. They're an adult now, so they have the legal right to change their name. The mother's reaction is about family tradition and honoring the grandfather, but does that outweigh the person's right to self-identify?\n\nIn many cultures, people can legally change their names for various reasons, especially if it's causing them distress. The fact that they've been using the nickname for a long time and it's become part of their identity suggests that this change isn't arbitrary. The mother's disapproval is a personal opinion, but the author is making a decision that affects their own life. While respecting family feelings is important, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they proceed, as they're asserting their identity and well-being.\n\nHowever, there might be nuances. If there were cultural or religious reasons tied to the grandfather's name, that could influence the perspective. But the scenario doesn't mention those. The main conflict is between the author's desire for a name that feels authentic and the mother's sentimentality. Since the author is an adult, their autonomy is a strong point. The answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
