My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate for them. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but the name is a short male name with no girly version. They've been teased for it throughout school, and now they're 21 and engaged. They want to change both their first and last names to a nickname based on their current last name that their friends use. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're forsaking their grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They've been mocked for their name, which is a valid reason for wanting to change it. Using a nickname that's more comfortable and aligns with their gender identity makes sense. At 21, they're an adult, so the right to choose their name is important. The parents' disapproval stems from the name's connection to the grandfather, but the person isn't changing the last name entirely; they're creating a nickname from it. The fianc\u00e9's support is a point in their favor.\n\nHowever, the parents feel the name change is disrespecting the grandfather. But the person isn't rejecting the family history entirely; they're adapting it. The nickname is derived from the last name, so it's a way to honor both their background and their identity.\n\nIn many cultures, changing one's name for personal reasons, especially after adulthood, is a personal right. The key factors are the person's well-being and the impact on their life. The parents' feelings are important, but the individual's happiness and comfort shouldn't be sacrificed unless there's a significant ethical or legal issue. Since the person has a valid reason and is taking steps to address the problem they've faced, it seems they're not in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No, they aren't in the wrong).\n"
