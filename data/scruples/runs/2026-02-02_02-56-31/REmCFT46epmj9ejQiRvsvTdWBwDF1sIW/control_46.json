My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. Their parents gave them a name after their grandpa, which is a male name, and they've been teased for it. Now they want to legally change both first and last names to a nickname their friends use, which is based on their current last name. Their mom is upset, saying they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the individual's right to choose their name is important. They've had a hard time with the name socially, which is a valid reason. They've been using the nickname for a long time, and even their fianc\u00e9 uses it. That suggests the new name is more comfortable and authentic to them. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents had a reason for naming them after the grandfather. But the person isn't erasing the grandfather's name entirely; they're using a nickname that's derived from their current last name. The parent's disapproval is tough, but the individual's well-being and personal identity should also be considered. \n\nName change laws usually allow people to change names for personal reasons. The mother's disapproval doesn't make the person wrong in their decision. They're prioritizing their own comfort and happiness in their adult life, which they have the right to do. The grandfather's memory is honored through the original name, but the person isn't rejecting that; they're just choosing a name that fits them better now. \n\nSo, the answer is B (they are not in the wrong). The person has valid reasons, and their right to self-determination outweighs the parent's disapproval.\n"
