My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) given by their parents, which was named after their grandfather. The parents didn't give the female version, so it's a short male name without a girly nickname. The person has been teased in school and is now 21 and engaged, wanting to change both first and last names to a nickname that friends use. The mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the individual to change their name. In many countries, adults have the legal right to change their name for any reason. The person is 21, so they're an adult, so they can legally do this. The parents' disapproval is a matter of personal feelings, but it doesn't override the person's right to choose their own identity. The name change is for their own well-being and to be called by a name that feels more like theirs, which is a valid reason.\n\nThe parents named the person after their grandfather, but the person is now choosing a name that better fits their identity and how they are perceived. The fact that the nickname is used by friends and even the fianc\u00e9 suggests that it's a name they've integrated into their life. The teasing from school indicates that the current name has caused them distress, which is a significant issue for self-esteem and mental health.\n\nHowever, the parents' feelings are important. The mother feels the name is a tribute to her husband (the grandfather), and changing it might feel like a rejection of their family tradition. But the person is making this decision at 21, which is a time to establish their own identity. The parents might be hurt, but the person's right to self-identification is a strong point in their favor.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both the letter of the law and the spirit of the matter. Legally, the person isn't in the wrong. Emotionally, the mother is upset, but that doesn't make the person wrong for wanting to change their name. The key points are autonomy, personal identity, and the impact of a name that's caused them to be teased. The answer is likely B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
