My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is at fault for wanting to change their name. The person is a woman who was named after her grandfather with a male name, like \"John.\" She's facing mockery at school because of it and wants to change her name to a nickname that her friends use. Her mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, thinking she's dishonoring her grandfather. The person is engaged and her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nSo, first, the key points here are about personal identity versus family expectations. The person feels her current name doesn't fit her identity, and she's been teased for it. Changing a name is a legal right in most places, so from a legal standpoint, she's not in the wrong. Her mom's disapproval is emotional and relates to honoring family history, but the person's well-being and self-identity are important too. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname suggests that the new name is already part of her social identity. While respecting family is important, the individual's happiness and comfort should also be considered. The mother's reaction is about her feelings about the grandfather's memory, but the person has the right to choose her own name. So, the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
