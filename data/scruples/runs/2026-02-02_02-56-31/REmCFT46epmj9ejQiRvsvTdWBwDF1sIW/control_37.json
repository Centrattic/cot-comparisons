My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name, which was their grandparents' name, to a nickname that their friends use. The parents are upset because they feel it's forsaking the memory of the grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They mentioned being teased at school, which is a valid reason for wanting to change their name. Also, they've used the nickname for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. That suggests it's a name they identify with now. But the parents are upset because they didn't name it with a female version in mind, and they think the person is disrespecting their grandfather.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to change their names, especially if it's causing them distress. The original name was given with a gesture (honoring the grandfather), but if it's not fitting for the person now, that's their choice. On the other hand, the parents might feel a cultural or familial tradition is being ignored. But the person is 21 and an adult, so they can make their own decisions. The parents' disapproval is their own issue, but the act of changing the name isn't inherently wrong. It's about personal identity versus family expectations. So the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
