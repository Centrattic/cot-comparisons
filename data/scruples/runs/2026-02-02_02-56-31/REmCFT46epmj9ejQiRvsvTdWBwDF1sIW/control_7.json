My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name. The situation is that they were given a male name by their parents, which is causing them issues because it doesn't fit their gender and they've been teased. They want to change both their first and last name to a nickname that's been used by friends and their fianc\u00e9. Their mom is upset, saying they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The person is an adult, 21, which is of age to make their own decisions. The name was given by parents, but it's causing them distress. The mom is disapproving, but the person is choosing a name that feels more like theirs. Legal rights to change a name usually are on the individual once they're adults. Also, the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, so it's integrated into their personal and social life now.\n\nThe parents' perspective is important, but so is the individual's right to self-identify. The name change isn't just about the first name; they're also changing the last name, which might be more about personal identity rather than just the male name. The key here is autonomy versus family tradition. Since the person is in a committed relationship and uses the nickname in all social settings, it's a significant part of their identity now. The mother's disapproval is a family matter, but the individual has the right to choose their name. So, probably not in the wrong.\n"
