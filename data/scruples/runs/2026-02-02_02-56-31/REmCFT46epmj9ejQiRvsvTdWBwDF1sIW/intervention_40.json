My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname they use. The parents named them after their grandpa, but didn't use the female version. The name is like \"John,\" which is short and not girly. They've been teased in school and are now 21 and engaged, wanting to change both first and last names to the nickname. Their mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the granddaddy's memory. The user's fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, and they've always used it socially.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong (A or B). Let's break it down. The user is an adult, 21, so they have the legal right to change their name. The parents gave them a name they find problematic, and it's caused them distress. The nickname has been used by friends and now the partner. The mother is upset about honoring the grandfather. But the user is choosing their own name now, which is a personal right. The parents can disapprove, but the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for making a choice that affects their own life and happiness. The key points are autonomy, the impact of the name on their life, and the parents' disapproval vs. the user's right to self-identify. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
