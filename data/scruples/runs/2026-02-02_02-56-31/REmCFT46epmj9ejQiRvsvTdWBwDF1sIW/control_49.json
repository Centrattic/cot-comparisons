My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The situation is that their parents gave them a male name (like \"John\") without a female equivalent, and they've been teased for it. Now they're 21, engaged, and want to legally change both their first and last name to a nickname that friends use. Their mom is upset, saying it's forsaking their grandfather's memory. The author wants to go ahead regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person is an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name. The name was chosen by parents, but it's not a good fit for the individual. The fact that they've been teased and have used a nickname for a long time suggests they've struggled with their name. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which might be important for their identity and relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother feels the name change is disrespectful to the grandfather. Family traditions and memories can be significant. But the person is making a choice about their own identity. At 21, they're past the age where parents can control that decision. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author's right to self-identify is a strong point.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action is objectively wrong. Name changes are legal, and personal identity is a valid reason. Even if family is upset, the individual isn't \"in the wrong\" for pursuing their own identity. The mother's reaction is emotional, but the author isn't violating any laws or causing direct harm. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
