  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The question is about changing their name from a boy's name to a nickname based on their last name. They were named after their grandfather, and their parents didn't use a female version. The person has been teased about their name in school and now wants to change it. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, feeling it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They've been made fun of, and the name doesn't fit their identity. They've used the nickname socially, even their fianc\u00e9 uses it. That seems like a valid reason to want a name that feels more authentic. On the other hand, the parents have their own feelings about the name being a tribute to the grandfather. But the person is an adult now, 21, and has the legal right to change their name. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but does that make the person in the wrong?\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong for going through with the change despite their mom's disapproval. In many cultures, people have the right to choose their name, especially in adulthood. The parents' wishes might be important to consider, but the person's well-being and comfort in their own identity are also significant. The fact that they've used the nickname for so long and it's part of their identity suggests that changing the name is about self-acceptance and happiness. The mom's reaction might be about their feelings, but the person isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own needs now. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
