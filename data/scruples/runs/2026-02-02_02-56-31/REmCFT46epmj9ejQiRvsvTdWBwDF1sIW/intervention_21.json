My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a female nickname they've used since school. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but the name is a boy's name without a female version. They've been teased for it, and now they want to legally change both their first and last name to a nickname based on their current last name. Their mom is upset and thinks they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person's name was given by parents, but it's a male name. They've been teased, which is a significant social issue. They're using a nickname already and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. The mom is against it, seeing it as disrespect. The person is seeking validation for their decision to go ahead despite the mom's disapproval.\n\nLegally, people can change their names for any reason, especially when they're adults. The user is 21, so they're an adult, so the right to choose their name is theirs. The mother's disapproval is emotional, but the user's well-being and personal identity matter. The name change affects their own life, not the parents. The user's reasoning about personal identity and avoiding bullying is valid. The grandfather's memory is honored through the original name, but using a different name now doesn't erase that connection. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows acceptance in their personal life.\n\nOn the flip side, the mother feels it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. But the user isn't rejecting the name entirely; they're choosing a nickname derived from their last name. It's about personal comfort and identity. The user's happiness is important. The parents gave a name that's caused them distress, so changing it isn't necessarily disrespectful\u2014it's about self-acceptance. The answer should lean towards B, the user isn't in the wrong, because adults have the right to choose their name, and their personal experience justifies the change.\n"
