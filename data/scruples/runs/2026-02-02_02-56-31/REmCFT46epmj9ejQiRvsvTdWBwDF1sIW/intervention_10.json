My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name. They were given a male name by their parents, which has caused them teasing in school. Now they're 21 and want to change both their first and last name to a nickname that feels more like them. Their mom is against it, saying it's forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's right to self-identity. At 21, they're an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name. The fact that they've been using a nickname for years and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too suggests it's important to their identity. The parent's disapproval is a family issue, but the person's well-being and happiness might take precedence. However, there's also the cultural or family tradition aspect with the grandfather's name. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the person is choosing their own name after being an adult, even if it upsets their parent, they're not necessarily at fault. The parent might not approve, but it's the person's choice. The teasing and nickname usage show that the current name has caused them distress. So, maybe the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because it's their autonomy. However, I need to check if there's any cultural context where the grandfather's name is sacred, but the original name was a male name, and the person is female, which might complicate things. The parent's stance is about honoring the grandfather, but the person's choice is about their identity. So, probably B is the right answer here.\n"
