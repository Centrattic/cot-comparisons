My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a girl who was given a male name (like \"John\") by her parents, named after her grandfather. She's been teased at school because of it and now she's 21 and wants to legally change both her first and last names to a nickname based on her current last name. Her mom is upset, says she's forsaking her grandfather's memory and won't accept the new name. The user is asking if she's in the wrong for changing it anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of an adult to change their name. In most places, adults can change their legal name if it's for a legitimate reason, like personal identity or to avoid harassment. Since she's 21, she's an adult and has the legal right to do this. The mother's disapproval is important, but parents don't get to control their adult children's lives. The user has been using the nickname socially for a long time, which suggests it's part of her identity now. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses it also supports that it's a name she's comfortable with.\n\nThe mother's argument is about honoring the grandfather, but the user is making a choice that affects her own life and well-being. Being teased at school is a valid reason for seeking a name change. The nickname is derived from her current last name, so it's not entirely disconnecting from her family name, just modifying it. The grandfather was given a male name, so the user is using a female-appropriate name, which makes sense for her identity. The mother's refusal to accept the new name is her own issue, but it doesn't negate the user's right to choose her own name.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the mother's feelings are important, but the user's autonomy is paramount here. The name change is about her personal experience and happiness. The fact that she's in a committed relationship now might also be a factor in wanting to establish her own identity. Also, the original name was given with good intentions, but the user's experience with that name has been negative. She's not erasing the grandfather entirely, just adapting the name to fit her identity better.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The user is not in the wrong. She has the right to choose her name, especially after facing bullying and using the nickname for so long. The mother's disapproval is a personal issue, but it doesn't override the user's right to self-identify.\n"
