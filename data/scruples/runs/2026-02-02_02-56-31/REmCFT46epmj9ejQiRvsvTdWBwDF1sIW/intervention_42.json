My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a woman who's considering changing her name from a traditionally male name given by her parents, which was named after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and wants to use a nickname derived from her last name, which her friends and fianc\u00e9 already use. Her mom is upset, saying she wouldn't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to change it despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons she has for wanting to change the name. The main points are that the name is a male name, causing her to be made fun of, and she's been using a nickname for a long time. Her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which suggests she's comfortable with it and it's her preferred name. \n\nRespecting cultural or family traditions is important, but so is an individual's right to choose their identity. If the name causes her distress and she's been using another name to the point that it feels more like hers, her autonomy might outweigh the family's wishes. \n\nHowever, the mother's perspective is also valid. Naming a child after a grandparent is a significant gesture, and changing the name could be seen as disrespecting that. But the mother's reaction is quite strong, even to the point of being \"insanely mad,\" which might indicate a lack of understanding of the daughter's emotional needs.\n\nIn many cultures, people have the legal right to change their names, especially as adults. The daughter is 21 and engaged, which is a time when people often make personal choices about their identity. The nickname-based name is derived from her current last name, so it's not entirely separate from her family's name, maybe maintaining a connection.\n\nThe key factors here are the daughter's personal comfort, her well-being, and her relationship with her partner. If the name change allows her to feel more at ease and accepted, that's a strong argument in her favor. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but it's also a matter of the daughter asserting her own identity. \n\nSo, considering all this, it's more about her right to self-identify and the importance of her mental well-being versus the family tradition. The mother's feelings are important, but they shouldn't override the daughter's personal needs. Therefore, the answer is likely B, Not in the wrong.\n"
