  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman who was given a male name by her parents, specifically named after her grandfather. She's facing issues with the name because it's short and masculine, leading to teasing. She wants to change her name to a nickname derived from her last name that she's used in social settings and by her fianc\u00e9. Her mom is against it, feeling it disrespects her grandfather.\n\nFirst, the person's right to change their name. In many jurisdictions, adults can legally change their names for any reason, so that's a basic right. The name given at birth doesn't have to be the one used throughout life. The fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time and it's become her social name suggests it's an established part of her identity.\n\nHer mom's disapproval is based on honoring her grandfather. However, the person is not erasing her grandfather; she's just changing her own name. The name change is about her personal identity and comfort, not about rejecting her family's history. The mother's stance seems to be emotional, but it's not a valid reason to deny the person's right to self-identify.\n\nThe teasing and the impact on her social life and self-esteem are significant factors. Her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, indicating acceptance and support from her partner. Prioritizing her well-being and personal identity over potential familial disapproval is reasonable. The mother's reaction might stem from not understanding the person's perspective, but that doesn't make the person wrong in seeking a name that feels authentic to her.\n\nSo, considering the right to self-determination, the impact on her life, and the support from her partner, the person isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
