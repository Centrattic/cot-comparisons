My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a woman who wants to legally change her name from a male name (like John) to a nickname based on her current last name. Her parents gave her the name after her grandpa, which she understands but feels is a boy's name that's caused her teasing. Now she's 21 and engaged, and wants to change her name. Her mom is upset and thinks she's dishonoring her grandpa.\n\nFirst, the user is an adult, so legally she can change her name if she wants. That's her right. The question is more about moral wrongness. The parents named her with a gesture (honoring her grandpa), but she's faced bullying because of it. She's been using a nickname for years, and her fianc\u00e9 uses that. The mom's reaction is disapproval and anger.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, she's choosing to use a name that makes her feel comfortable and accepted, especially after years of teasing. The nickname is already a part of her identity in social circles. The parents' naming choice was a gesture, but the user is now making a choice that affects her own identity. It's a personal decision, and while the parents are hurt, their feelings don't override her right to self-identify. The key points here are her right to self-determination as an adult, the impact of the name on her well-being, and the fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time. The mom's refusal to accept the new name is hurtful, but the user isn't in the wrong for pursuing her own identity and happiness. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
