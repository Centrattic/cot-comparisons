My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name given by their parents, which was after their grandfather, to a nickname-based name that they've used socially. Their mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The user has been teased for their name, which is a male name (like \"John\") given to a girl. They're 21 and engaged, planning to change both first and last names. The nickname they want to use is already a part of their social identity, even used by their fianc\u00e9. The parents, especially the mom, are against it, feeling it disrespects the grandfather.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong by going through with the name change despite their mom's disapproval. \n\nFrom a personal autonomy perspective, adults have the legal right to change their names. The user's name has caused them social issues, and they're choosing a name that aligns with their identity. The nickname has been part of their social interactions, so it's significant to them. The grandfather's name was a gesture, but the user isn't rejecting the memory entirely by changing their name; they might still honor him in other ways.\n\nHowever, the mom's feelings about honoring the grandfather are valid. There's a cultural aspect where family names and traditions are important. The user is making a choice that affects family dynamics, so there's a balance between personal identity and family respect.\n\nBut the core issue is about the user's right to self-identify with a name they've used for years, especially when it's causing distress. The parents' disapproval is hurting the user's emotional well-being. The user isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to reclaim their identity through a name they feel represents them better. The answer likely leans towards B, not in the wrong, because it's about personal identity and well-being, which are important considerations.\n"
