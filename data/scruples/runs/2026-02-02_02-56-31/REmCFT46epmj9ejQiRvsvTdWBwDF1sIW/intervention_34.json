  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents. They were named after their grandfather, but the name is a short male one like \"John\" that doesn't have a girly nickname. They've been teased at school and now they're 21 and want to change their name to a nickname based on their last name. Their mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the person's autonomy over their own name and the importance of their parents' wishes. At 21, the person is an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name. The fact that they've used the nickname for a long time and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too suggests that this name is more comfortable and authentic to them. The teasing they experienced could have affected their self-esteem, so changing the name might be a way to address that.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents named them after a grandparent, which is a traditional gesture. The mother's disapproval might stem from feeling that the new name disrespects the grandfather. However, the person isn't rejecting the grandfather's memory entirely; they're just changing their personal name. The grandfather's name is still honored in the original name, but the person is choosing a name that fits their identity better.\n\nThe question is about whether the person is in the wrong. Since they are an adult, the decision to change their name is their right. While respecting their parents' feelings is important, the person has a right to their own identity. The mother's reaction is harsh, but the person isn't wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and well-being. The nickname has been a part of their social identity for years, so using it legally could help them feel more authentic. Therefore, the answer is B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
