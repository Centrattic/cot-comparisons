My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. The author was given a male name (like John) by her parents, which she's been teased for. She wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname based on her current last name, which her friends use. Her mom is against it, saying she's dishonoring her grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The name was given by parents, but it's causing her distress. She's been teased, which affects her well-being. She's using a nickname socially, and her fianc\u00e9 uses that too. Changing the name would align her official name with how she's known. Her mom's argument is about honoring the grandfather, but the author might feel her autonomy is important. \n\nLegal aspects: In many places, adults can legally change their names without family consent. Emotional factors: Her happiness and comfort vs. familial expectations. The mom's disapproval is emotional, but does that make the author wrong? The key is whether the author has the right to make this personal choice despite family disapproval. \n\nThe question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the author is acting within her rights and prioritizing her well-being, then she's not wrong. The mom's feelings are valid, but the author's decision to change is her own. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
