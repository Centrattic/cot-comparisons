My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a woman who wants to change her name from a male name she was given at birth to a nickname that's more feminine and fits her better. Her parents named her after her grandfather, using a male name, not the female version. She's been teased for her name and wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is against it, saying she wouldn't accept the new name and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather. The user is asking if she's in the wrong for wanting to go ahead despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. She's 21, an adult, and the name has caused her distress. She's been using a nickname for years, and her fianc\u00e9 uses that name. It seems like she's seeking to align her legal name with how she's been identified socially and personally. The right to choose one's name is a personal choice, especially as an adult. The parents might feel hurt or that she's disregarding family tradition, but the user's well-being and personal identity are important factors.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's feelings are valid; she's upset because the name was chosen to honor her father. However, the user isn't the mother, and the mother's approval isn't necessary for the user to make this change. The key here is autonomy versus family sentiment. While the mother's feelings are hurt, the user has the right to make decisions about her own identity, especially when it affects her daily life and happiness.\n\nThe name being a male name without a female variant can be challenging. The user's choice to change it to a nickname that's more suitable for her gender and personal identity is a valid decision. The teasing she's experienced adds to the justification for wanting to change her name. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows that it's accepted in her personal life, which supports her desire for legal change.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user isn't wrong for prioritizing her own comfort and identity. However, she might need to consider how to handle the family dynamics sensitively. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling the family's feelings perfectly. Since she's an adult, the decision is hers to make, regardless of her parents' disapproval. The mother's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't mean the user is in the wrong for asserting her own identity.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She has the right to choose her name, especially when it aligns with her identity and improves her quality of life. The mother's feelings are important, but they don't override the user's right to self-determination.\n"
