My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname based on their last name. They were named after their grandfather, but the name is a male one without a female equivalent. They've faced teasing and now want to change their name, but their mom is upset, saying they're dishonoring their grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's rights to their own identity. People often change names for various reasons like gender identity, personal preference, or to distance from an abusive past. In this case, the person is using a nickname they've been called by socially, which feels more authentic to them. That seems like a valid reason for self-identity.\n\nNext, the parents' perspective. They named them after their grandfather, which is a common practice to honor family members. The mother feels the new name forgoes that memory. However, the child is now an adult (21) and has the right to make decisions about their own name. While the mother's feelings are important, they shouldn't override the adult child's autonomy.\n\nThe social context is also a factor. The person has been teased for years, which can affect mental health and self-esteem. Changing the name could help them feel more accepted and comfortable, especially since their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname. It's about their personal happiness and how they present themselves to the world.\n\nLegal aspects: In many places, adults can legally change their names without parental consent, which reinforces their right to do so. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the decision to change the name is the individual's to make.\n\nBalancing respect for family and personal identity: The person should probably communicate their reasons clearly to their mother, explaining that it's about self-identity and not disrespecting their grandfather. The nickname might carry the same essence but in a way that's more fitting for their identity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong. They are asserting their autonomy and choosing a name that aligns with how they see themselves, which is a valid and important personal choice.\n"
