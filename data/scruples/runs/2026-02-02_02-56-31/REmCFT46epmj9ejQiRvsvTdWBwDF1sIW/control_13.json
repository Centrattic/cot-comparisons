My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman who was given a male name, John, by her parents who named her after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and now wants to change her name to a nickname that her friends use, which is based on her last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is a personal choice. In many places, as long as you're not trying to evade legal obligations, you can legally change your name. Her reason is about personal identity and comfort, which is valid. She's been teased, which adds to the emotional impact.\n\nHer parents chose the name, but she's now an adult. The argument about honoring her grandfather is about respecting family tradition, but she's not dishonoring him by changing her name. The nickname she uses is already how she's known socially, so changing her legal name to match that could make sense for consistency and authenticity.\n\nHer mom's disapproval is a conflict, but the question is whether she's in the wrong for proceeding. Since she's an adult, the decision should be hers. The key points are her right to self-identify and the practicality of her nickname being her real name now. The parents' feelings are hurt, but that doesn't override her right to make this choice. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
