My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that they were given a male name (like \"John\") by their parents, which is a tribute to their grandfather. They've been teased for it and now, at 21 and engaged, want to legally change both their first and last name to a nickname based on their current last name. Their mom is upset, feeling like they're dishonoring their grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to choose their own name. In many places, adults have the legal right to change their names if they wish. The original name was given with a male name, which might not fit the person's identity now, especially if they're presenting as female. The fact that they've used a nickname in social settings for years suggests that they've already been living with that identity publicly. Their fianc\u00e9 uses that nickname, which adds to the personal significance.\n\nThen there's the aspect of family history and the grandfather's name. The parents intended a tribute, but if the name is causing the person distress and impacting their self-esteem (due to being teased), the balance between honoring tradition and personal well-being becomes a key point. The mother's disapproval is emotional, but should that override the person's own needs?\n\nCulturally, there's a growing acceptance of name changes for self-identity reasons. The person's age (21) indicates they're an adult, so their autonomy is a strong factor here. The mother's reaction might be about feeling disrespected, but the individual's right to self-identify is also important.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the person isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their identity and legal rights. The mother's feelings are valid, but the individual's choice to live authentically is a stronger consideration here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
