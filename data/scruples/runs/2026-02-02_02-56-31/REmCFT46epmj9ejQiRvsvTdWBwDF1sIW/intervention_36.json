My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a girl who was given a male name (like \"John\") by her parents, who named her after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and now wants to legally change her name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is upset and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather. The user is asking if she's in the wrong for going through with the name change despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The name given was a male name, and there's no female equivalent provided. The user has faced bullying because of it, which is a significant issue. She's an adult now, 21, engaged, and her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname. She's been using this nickname socially for a long time, which suggests it's her preferred name. Her mother's main argument is about honoring the grandfather, but the user feels the nickname is more her identity now.\n\nName change laws vary, but in many places, adults can legally change their names if they choose. The mother's disapproval doesn't legally stop her. The emotional aspect is about identity versus family tradition. The user's experience with bullying and the nickname being part of her social identity for years are strong points in her favor. The mother's argument is about honoring her grandfather, but if the name is causing harm and the user is choosing a name that aligns better with her identity, that's a valid personal choice. The fianc\u00e9's acceptance also supports her decision to move forward.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the user is making a choice that affects her own life and well-being. While family feelings are important, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her own comfort and identity, especially after years of using the nickname and facing negative experiences with the original name. The answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
