My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The situation is that the author was given a male name (like \"John\") by their parents, who named her after her grandfather. The author has been teased for it and wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname that her friends use. Her mom is upset, saying it's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the individual versus family tradition. The author is 21, so an adult, and has the legal right to change her name. The fact that she's been using a nickname for years and her fianc\u00e9 uses that name suggests that she's been living under that name socially for a while. The name change is about her identity and comfort, which is important. However, the mother feels hurt because it's a family name connected to her grandfather. \n\nBut, the parents didn't use the female version of the name, leading to the current issue. The author is not just changing the nickname but making it official. The mother's disapproval is emotional, but does that make the author wrong? In many cases, people have the right to choose their own names as adults, especially if it's causing them distress. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's right to self-identify is also significant. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a decision that affects her own life and happiness. The mother's disapproval is a personal conflict, but it doesn't make the daughter wrong. People should have the autonomy to choose their names, especially when it's about their well-being and how they are perceived by others.\n"
