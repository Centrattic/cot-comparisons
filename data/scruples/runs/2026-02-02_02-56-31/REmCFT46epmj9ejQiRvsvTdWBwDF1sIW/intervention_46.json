My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a woman who was named after her grandfather with a male name, like \"John,\" which doesn't have a feminine variant. She's been teased for it in school and now wants to legally change both her first and last names. Her mother is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, and friends do too.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The main factors here are her well-being versus the family's feelings. The question is about personal choice. Changing your name is a personal decision, especially if it's causing distress. The nickname has been her social name for a long time, which suggests she's been using it as her identity. The mother's disapproval is a conflict here, but the mother isn't the one living with the name. \n\nThe user mentions being made fun of, which is a valid reason for wanting to change. The grandfather's memory is important to the family, but the user is trying to honor her own identity. The name change isn't about rejecting the grandfather entirely but about finding a name that fits her better. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about personal autonomy. Unless there's a legal or cultural issue I'm missing, she's within her rights to change her name. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the user's happiness and comfort are also important. So, the answer would lean towards B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She's making a choice that affects her life, and while it's considerate to explain her reasons, she isn't obligated to keep a name that causes her distress.\n"
