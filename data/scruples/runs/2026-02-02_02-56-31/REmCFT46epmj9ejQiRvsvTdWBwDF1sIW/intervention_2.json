My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name they were given by their parents. They mentioned their parents named them after their grandfather, but it's a male name without a female equivalent. The user has been teased for it in school and now wants to change both their first and last name to a nickname that their friends use. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, thinking they're forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the individual versus family expectations. The user is an adult, 21 and engaged. Legally, they can change their name if they want. The issue is more about the emotional and familial conflict. The parents named them after the grandfather, which is a traditional gesture, but the name isn't suitable for a girl. The user has been made fun of, which affects their well-being. The nickname is how they're known socially and by their fianc\u00e9.\n\nOn one hand, changing the name could be seen as respecting the user's identity and comfort. On the other hand, the parents feel the name is honoring their grandfather. But the user isn't rejecting the grandfather's memory; they're just using a different name that fits better. The parents' disapproval is tough, but the user's autonomy is important. Since they're an adult, they have the right to make this choice. The key points are the user's well-being versus family tradition. The answer likely leans towards B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
