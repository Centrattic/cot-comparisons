My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name away from the one their parents gave them. The name is a male name, like John, and they were named after their grandfather. They were teased for it in school and now they're 21, engaged, and want to change both their first and last name to a nickname they've used. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons they want to change their name. They mention being teased, which can affect someone's self-esteem and social interactions. Also, they've always used a nickname, which feels more like their own name now. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname too, which suggests they're comfortable with it. On the other hand, the parents named them after the grandfather, which is a significant family tradition. The mom is upset that they're changing the name that honors their grandfather.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, at 21, they're an adult and have the legal right to change their name. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but they can't control the adult child's decisions. However, the emotional aspect is tricky. The mother feels like the name is a tribute to her father, so changing it might feel like dishonoring him. But the user is also considering their own well-being and comfort. They're not trying to erase the grandfather's memory, just choosing a name that fits them better now. The nickname seems to have been established over time, so it's not just a random change.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy vs. family tradition. While the family's feelings are important, the user's own identity and happiness are significant. They're not causing harm by changing their name legally. The mother's disapproval is a personal reaction, but the user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs. So the answer is B.\n"
