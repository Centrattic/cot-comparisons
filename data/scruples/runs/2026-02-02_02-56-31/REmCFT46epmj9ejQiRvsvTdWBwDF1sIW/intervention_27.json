  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman named after her grandfather with a male name, like \"John.\" She's being teased for it and wants to legally change her name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if she's in the wrong for changing her name. From an ethical standpoint, people have the right to choose their names, especially if it's causing them distress. The fact that the nickname is already widely used by friends and significant other supports her identity. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the daughter's well-being and self-identity are important. The grandfather's memory is honored by the name, but the daughter isn't rejecting it\u2014she's choosing a name that fits her better. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
