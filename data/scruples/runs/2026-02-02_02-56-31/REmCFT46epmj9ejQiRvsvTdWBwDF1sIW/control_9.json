My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. The author was named after their grandfather, but the name is a common boy's name, leading to teasing. They want to change their name to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate, which their friends use. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking her grandfather's memory. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's rights. In many places, adults can legally change their names for personal reasons. The author is 21 and engaged, so they're an adult making a choice for themselves. The name change affects their own identity and how they're perceived. The mother's disapproval is a family issue but doesn't make the author wrong.\n\nThe mother's argument is about honoring the grandfather. But the author's name was chosen by the parents, and the author now chooses to change it. The grandfather's memory is important to the mother, but the author is the one living with the name daily. The teasing and using a nickname that's been accepted socially suggest that the name change would improve the author's quality of life.\n\nIs the author respecting the grandfather's memory by changing the name? The original name was a boy's name, and the author is changing it to a female version. The grandfather's name was a male name, but the choice to name someone after a male relative with a male name doesn't inherently require the same name to be used if the person identifies differently. The nickname might be a way to honor the original name in a different form.\n\nThe key points are autonomy, personal identity, and family dynamics. The author isn't necessarily disrespecting the grandfather; they're choosing a name that aligns with their identity. The mother's feelings are valid but shouldn't override the author's right to self-identify. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
