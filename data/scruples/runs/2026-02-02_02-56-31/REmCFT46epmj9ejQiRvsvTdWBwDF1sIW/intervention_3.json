My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Let me start by breaking down the situation. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but it's a male name with no female equivalent. The name is like \"John,\" which is short and not typically considered girly. They've been teased about it in school, and now at 21 and engaged, they want to change both their first and last names. The nickname from friends is what they want to use, and their fianc\u00e9 uses that name too. Their mom is upset, feeling they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The user is an adult, 21, which is of legal age to make their own decisions. The name change is about personal identity and comfort, which is a valid reason. The fact that they've used the nickname in social settings for a long time suggests it's part of their identity now. The parents' disapproval is a concern, but does that make the user in the wrong?\n\nIn many cultures, especially in Western ones, changing one's name for personal reasons is a common and accepted practice. It's about self-expression and how one wishes to be known. However, family dynamics can complicate this. The mother's disapproval is based on honoring the grandfather's memory, which is a sentimental issue. The user might feel a conflict between respecting their family's wishes and their own sense of identity.\n\nBut here's the thing: the user is an adult. The decision to change a name is a personal one, and unless there are legal issues or specific cultural taboos, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are reclaiming their identity, especially since the original name has caused them distress. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname supports that it's a name they are comfortable with and that others recognize them by.\n\nHowever, the user should consider the emotional impact on their parents. It's about balancing personal identity with family relationships. Maybe the user could have a conversation with their parents to explain why this change is important, perhaps finding a way to honor the grandfather while still making the change. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. Since the user is acting on their own autonomy and the name change is for their well-being, it's more about their right to self-determination rather than being in the wrong. The parents' disapproval is their issue, not the user's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, they're not in the wrong). The key factors are adult autonomy, personal identity, and the reasons for the name change. The mother's disapproval is significant but doesn't make the user at fault. The user has a right to choose their name, especially after years of using the nickname and the name causing them issues.\n"
