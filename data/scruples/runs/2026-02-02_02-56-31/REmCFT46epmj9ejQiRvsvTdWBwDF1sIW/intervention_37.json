My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents, which they were named after their grandfather. They've faced teasing in school and now they're 21 and want to change both their first and last name to a nickname their friends use. Their mom is upset, saying she doesn't approve and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nSo, the key points here are the person's autonomy, their right to choose their name, and the parents' feelings versus their own. At 21, they're an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name. The name was given by parents as a tribute, but the person has been using a nickname that feels more like their own. The mom's disapproval is a family issue, but the adult child's well-being and comfort in their own name is important.\n\nIn such cases, many would argue that the individual has the right to choose their name, especially if it's causing distress. The parents' feelings are valid, but they can't override the adult child's decision. The fact that the nickname has been used socially and by the fianc\u00e9 supports the idea that this is a meaningful and personal choice. So, the answer is likely B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
