My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation. The author is a girl who was given a male name, \"John,\" by her parents, named after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and now wants to legally change her name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she disapproves and would be mad if she goes through with it. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, and friends do too. The question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to change her name despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, legal name changes are generally a personal choice. People can change their names for various reasons, like gender identity, cultural reasons, or personal preference. In this case, the author is choosing a name that she feels more comfortable with and that friends and her fianc\u00e9 use. The fact that the nickname is from her last name might be a way to retain some connection to her family name, which could be a respectful compromise.\n\nHer parents named her after her grandfather, which she appreciates the gesture but feels the name isn't suitable for her. The name has caused her to be teased, which is a valid reason for wanting to change it. Her mother's disapproval is about feeling like the author is forsaking her grandfather's memory. However, using a nickname as her legal name might still honor the grandfather indirectly through the last name, but the mother's perspective is that the first name is a direct link.\n\nBut in many cultures, especially in Western ones, individuals have the right to choose their own names, even if it means diverging from family tradition. The author's right to self-identify her name is important. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author's well-being and comfort with her name are also significant. The fianc\u00e9's acceptance and the nickname being widely used suggest that this is a name she's been using for a long time, making it feel more authentic to her.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She has a valid reason for wanting to change her name, and it's her right to do so. The mother's feelings are valid too, but the author's autonomy and the impact of the name on her life should be the priority. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
