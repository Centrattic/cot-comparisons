My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name they were given by their parents. They mention their parents named them after their grandfather, but didn't use a female version. The name is a short male name like John without a feminine nickname. They were teased in school, are 21, engaged, and want to change both first and last names to a nickname based on their current last name. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user's reasoning is that they've always used the nickname, their fianc\u00e9 uses it, and it feels more like their name now. The mom is upset but the user is going ahead. \n\nFirst, changing one's name is a personal choice. People have the legal right to change their names, so that's a point in favor of B. The user is using their nickname as their new name, which they've been doing for years. The parent's disapproval is a conflict, but it's about respecting their own feelings vs. honoring family tradition. The user might be prioritizing their identity and comfort over the parent's wishes, which can be valid. However, the parent's perspective is about family legacy and respect for the grandfather. \n\nBut the user isn't denying the grandfather's memory; they're just choosing a name that feels more authentic to them. The parent's disapproval is emotional, but the user's right to self-identify is important. The teasing they endured adds to the justification of wanting to change. \n\nSo the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). They have a right to choose their name, even if it upsets family members. The parent's feelings are valid, but the user isn't wrong for making a decision that affects their own life and happiness.\n"
