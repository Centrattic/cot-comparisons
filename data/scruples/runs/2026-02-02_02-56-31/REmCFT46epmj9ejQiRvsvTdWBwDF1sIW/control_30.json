My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, especially since it's a name after their grandfather. The situation is that the parents gave her a boy's name (like John) and she wants to use a nickname derived from her last name instead. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. She mentions being made fun of, which is a valid reason for wanting to change her name. Using a nickname that friends have always called her and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too. At 21, she's an adult, so she has the legal right to change her name. The parents gave her the name, but it's causing her distress. The cultural aspect is important here\u2014naming after a grandparent is significant, but the person now wants to honor that memory in a different way? Or maybe she feels her current name doesn't reflect her identity.\n\nHer mother's disapproval is emotional, but the person is making a choice about her own identity. In many societies, adults can legally change their names for personal reasons, even if family members disapprove. The key points are autonomy, personal identity, and the impact of the name on her well-being. The mother's feelings are hurt, but the person's right to self-determination might outweigh that. So, likely the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. The mother's reaction is about their feelings, but she's making her own choices as an adult.\n"
