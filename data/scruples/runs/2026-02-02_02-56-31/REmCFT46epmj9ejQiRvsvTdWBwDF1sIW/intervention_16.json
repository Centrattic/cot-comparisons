My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name they've been given to a nickname that their friends use and their fianc\u00e9 uses. Their parents named them after their grandfather, a male name, and the user is a girl. They've been teased about it and now want to legally change both their first and last name. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name.\n\nSo the user's reasoning is that the name was given in a gesture, but it's causing them distress and they want to use a name they feel is more their own. They're 21 and engaged, which gives them some autonomy. The parents feel like they're dishonoring the grandfather, but the user has always used the nickname socially. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, in most places, adults can change their names without needing family approval. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but it's their choice to make. The user's well-being and self-identity are important factors. The fact that the name has caused them to be teased and that they want to use a name that feels more authentic to them supports their decision. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname also indicates social acceptance. \n\nSo the key points are personal autonomy, the impact of the name on the user's life, and the respect for the grandfather's memory versus the user's identity. The answer likely leans towards B, not in the wrong, because they're making a personal choice that affects their own life and happiness, even if it causes tension with family.\n"
