My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name. They were given a boy's name by their parents, which they're now 21 and want to change to a nickname based on their last name. Their mom is upset because it's supposed to honor their grandfather, but the user feels the name isn't suitable for a girl and made them a target for teasing. They want to use the nickname they've always used.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They've been teased for their name, which is a valid reason for wanting to change it. Using a nickname in social situations shows they've already identified with that name for a while. The fact that their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname supports their desire to make it official. \n\nThen there's the family aspect. The parents named them after the grandfather, which is a meaningful tradition. The mom's disapproval is based on honoring that memory. However, the user is an adult now, so the right to choose their own name becomes a factor. Changing one's name is a personal decision, especially when it affects their comfort and identity. \n\nThe key points are the user's well-being and autonomy versus respecting family traditions. While the mother's feelings are important, the user's right to self-identify with a name they feel represents them better is also significant. The fact that the nickname has been used for years suggests it's a natural extension of their identity. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, they're not in the wrong). The user has valid reasons based on personal experience and identity. While the mother's feelings matter, the user is within their rights to change their name for personal reasons.\n"
