My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe person is a girl named after her grandfather, but the name is a male name like \"John\" with no female equivalent. She's been teased about it in school and now, at 21 and engaged, wants to change her first and last name to a nickname her friends use. Her mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The question is whether she's in the wrong for going ahead despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name was given by parents with a specific intention (honoring the grandfather), but the name causes her distress and social issues. She's an adult now, so it's about her autonomy over her own name. The mom's disapproval is significant, but does that make the person in the wrong?\n\nFrom a legal and personal autonomy standpoint, adults can change their names without needing others' approval. The emotional aspect is important too\u2014she's been teased, which can affect self-esteem. The nickname is what she's known by socially and by her fianc\u00e9, so adopting it could be about her identity and comfort.\n\nHer mom's feelings about honoring the grandfather are valid, but they shouldn't override the person's right to choose her own name. It's a conflict between family tradition and individual identity. Since she's an adult, the decision is hers to make. The mom's disapproval is hurtful, but the person isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own well-being and identity.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The reasoning is about personal autonomy, the impact of the name on her life, and the fact that changing a name is a personal choice once you're an adult.\n"
