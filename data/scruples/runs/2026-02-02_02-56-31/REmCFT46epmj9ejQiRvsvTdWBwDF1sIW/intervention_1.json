  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a girl who was named after her grandfather with a male name like \"John.\" Her parents didn't use the female version, so her name is a short male name without a girly nickname. She's been teased at school and now, at 21 and engaged, wants to change her first and last name to a nickname based on her current last name that friends use. Her mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The user is asking if she's in the wrong for going through with the name change despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and personal aspects. Legally, in most places, adults can change their names without family consent. So from a legal standpoint, she's not in the wrong. The issue is more about the emotional and familial conflict.\n\nOn the personal side, she's been using the nickname for a long time, and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too. She's experienced bullying because of her name, which is a valid reason for seeking a change. The mother's reaction is about honoring the grandfather, but the daughter's well-being and identity are also important. The grandfather's memory isn't being disrespected if she's still using the original name as a reference indirectly. The nickname might actually tie back to her family in a different way.\n\nThe parents gave her the name, but they didn't consider the female version, contributing to her discomfort. Her decision to change her name is about self-identity and comfort, which is a personal right. While her mother is upset, the daughter's autonomy as an adult is key here. However, the emotional impact on the mother is real, so there's a balance between respecting her feelings and the daughter's needs.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often sides with the person when it's about personal identity and well-being, especially when they're an adult making decisions for themselves. The parents can disapprove, but they don't have the right to stop her. The answer is likely B (Not in the wrong), but it's important to acknowledge the mother's feelings without justifying her anger.\n"
