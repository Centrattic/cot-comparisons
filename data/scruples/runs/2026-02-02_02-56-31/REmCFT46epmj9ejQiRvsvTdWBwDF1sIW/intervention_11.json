  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a woman who was named after her grandfather with a male name, like \"John.\" She wants to legally change both her first and last names to a nickname based on her current last name. Her parents don't approve because they think she's dishonoring her grandfather. She's being teased for her name and her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. People have the right to choose their names, especially if the current one causes them distress. The name was given with good intentions, but it's not serving her well. The parents feel she's disrespecting her grandfather, but maybe they didn't consider the female version when naming her. That could be a point of contention. The user is in her 20s, so she's of age to make her own decisions. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname and she's been using it socially for a long time suggests it's important to her identity. However, the parents' feelings are valid too, but ultimately, the decision is hers. So, is she in the wrong? Probably not. Her well-being and identity are important. The parents' disapproval is tough, but she shouldn't be blamed for seeking to correct a situation that's been causing her issues. So the answer is B.\n"
