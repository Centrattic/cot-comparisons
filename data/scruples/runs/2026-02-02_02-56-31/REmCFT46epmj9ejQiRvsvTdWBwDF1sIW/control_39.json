My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Let me start by going through the details they provided.\n\nThe person is a woman who was given a male name, \"John,\" which is named after her grandfather. She mentions that her parents didn't use the female version of the name. She's been mocked for her name in school, and now she's 21 and engaged. She wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname that friends have used for her. Her mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons she wants to change her name. She's been teased for her name, which is a significant issue. Being bullied or made fun of for something like your name can have a lasting emotional impact. She's been using the nickname socially for a long time, and even her fianc\u00e9 uses that nickname. That suggests that this nickname is a part of her identity now. \n\nOn the other hand, her parents named her after her grandfather, which is a meaningful gesture. The mother is upset because she feels changing the name is disrespecting her grandfather's memory. There's a conflict between honoring family tradition and the individual's right to self-identify. \n\nFrom a personal autonomy perspective, once someone is an adult, they generally have the right to make decisions about their own name, especially if it's affecting their well-being. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the daughter's reasons are valid. However, there's also the aspect of family relationships. The mother might feel betrayed, which is a valid emotion, but the daughter's need for a name that feels authentic to her is also important.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The key points are the daughter's well-being versus honoring family legacy. In many cases, people choose to change their names for personal reasons, and while family opinions matter, the final decision rests with the individual. The mother's reaction is strong, but it doesn't necessarily make the daughter wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B, meaning the author is not in the wrong. She's making a choice that aligns with her identity and well-being, even if it causes tension with her family. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter has the right to choose her name as an adult.\n"
