My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that they were given a male name (like John) by their parents, who named them after their grandfather. The person is a girl, and the name isn't a female version. They've been teased for it, and now they want to change both their first and last name to a nickname that friends use. Their mom is upset, saying they're dishonoring the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's rights over their name. In many places, adults can legally change their names without needing permission from family, so that's a point in their favor. The fact that they've been teased and use the nickname in social settings suggests it's important for their self-identity and comfort. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname also indicates that the new name is already part of their personal and possibly professional life.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents' feelings are important. They named them after a family member, which carries sentimental value. The mom's disapproval might stem from feeling that the family's memory is being disregarded. However, the person is an adult, so the decision ultimately rests with them. The key here is balancing personal identity against family history. While the parents might feel hurt, the person has the right to choose their name as an adult. The main issue is whether the person is in the wrong for making this choice despite their parents' objections. Since the name change is about their own identity and well-being, and they're not causing harm beyond the emotional impact on their family, it's more likely they aren't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
