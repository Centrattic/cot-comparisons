My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname that feels more like them, especially since their parents named them after their grandfather but didn't use the female version. They've been teased at school, and their mom doesn't approve, saying she'd never accept the new name. The user is 21 and engaged, and their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the different perspectives here. The user's main reason is about personal identity and comfort. They've been using the nickname for a long time, which makes them feel more authentic. On the other hand, the parents see it as disrespect to the grandfather's memory. \n\nBut when it comes to legal name changes, the parents' approval isn't a legal requirement. The user is an adult, so they have the right to make decisions about their own name. The mother's disapproval is hurtful but doesn't necessarily mean the user is in the wrong. The user's well-being and happiness are also important, especially since they've faced bullying. \n\nHowever, maybe the user could try to find a middle ground, like keeping the name but adding a middle name or using the nickname more openly. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for going ahead despite the mom's disapproval. The user's actions are about their own identity and comfort, which are personal choices. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname suggests that it's a name they're comfortable with in their life. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, they're not in the wrong). They're making a decision that affects their own life and identity, which is valid even if it upsets their parents.\n"
