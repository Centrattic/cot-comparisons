My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is a girl who was given a boy's name, John, by her parents. It's after her grandfather. She's been teased for it, and now she's 21 and wants to legally change her name to the nickname she's always used. Her mom is upset, saying she wouldn't accept the new name and that she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for changing her name despite her mom's disapproval. Let's break it down. \n\nName changes are a personal choice. Especially when someone is an adult, they have the right to choose their own name. The person has been using the nickname her whole life, so it's part of her identity. The fact that her parents gave her a name that doesn't fit her gender and caused her to be teased seems like a reason to change. The grandfather was named John, but that's not her fault. Her parents could have chosen a female version, but they didn't. Now she's facing the consequences of a name that doesn't suit her.\n\nHer mother's disapproval is about family tradition and honoring the grandfather. But the author is an adult and has the legal right to change her name. The mother's feelings are important, but the author's well-being and identity matter too. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which shows her partner supports her. Also, the teasing she's experienced is a valid reason to seek change. \n\nHowever, there's a consideration of family relationships. The mother is upset, and changing the name might cause a rift. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't violating any laws, and her decision is about her own identity. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
