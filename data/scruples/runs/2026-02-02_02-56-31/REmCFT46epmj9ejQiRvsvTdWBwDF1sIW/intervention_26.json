My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname based on their last name, even though their parents named them after their grandfather and disapprove. They\u2019ve faced teasing and their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal rights versus family expectations. In many places, adults have the legal right to change their names. The person is 21, so they\u2019re an adult, which means they can make decisions about their own identity. The fact that they\u2019ve used the nickname socially for a long time suggests they\u2019ve been comfortable with it for years, and now they want it officially changed.\n\nThe parents' disapproval is significant\u2014they feel it\u2019s forsaking the grandfather\u2019s memory. But the user isn\u2019t necessarily rejecting the grandfather\u2019s memory; they\u2019re choosing a name that feels more authentic to them. The name they were given doesn\u2019t have a female version, leading to teasing, which affects their well-being. Changing the name could help them feel more at ease and true to themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of family tradition and respect for ancestors. The parents might feel the user is disregarding their wishes and the significance of the original name. However, the user isn't rejecting the grandfather entirely but is seeking a name that aligns better with their identity and experiences.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows that the partner supports this choice, which can be a positive factor. The user's mental health and comfort in their own name are important. If changing the name allows them to live more authentically and reduces the stress from being teased, it's a valid reason.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's autonomy is crucial. The user has the right to choose their identity, even if it causes tension with family. While the parents' feelings matter, the user's right to self-identify is a strong point in their favor. So, the answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
