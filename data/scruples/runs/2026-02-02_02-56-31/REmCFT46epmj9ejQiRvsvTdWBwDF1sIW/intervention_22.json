My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a traditionally male name to a nickname-based name, which their friends use. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but the name is a male name with no female version. The user has been teased for it and now wants to change both first and last names. Their mom is upset and thinks they're forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the user is at fault here. The name change is about personal identity and comfort. The user feels that the nickname is more representative of them and they've used it socially. Their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname too. The parents' disapproval is based on tradition and honoring the grandfather. But the user is an adult, 21, so legally they can change their name. The key points here are autonomy versus family tradition. \n\nChanging a name is a personal choice, especially when it's causing distress. The fact that they've used the nickname for a long time and it's part of their identity now supports their decision. The parents' feelings are valid, but the user has the right to define their own identity. The parents might feel hurt, but the user isn't wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and authenticity. The answer here should be B, meaning they're not in the wrong.\n"
