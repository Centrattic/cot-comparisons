  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's changing her name from a male name given by her parents, which was after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and is changing both her first and last name to a nickname that her friends have used. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. She's been made fun of for her name, which is a valid reason. People shouldn't be bullied for their names, and changing it to feel more comfortable in social settings makes sense. Also, she's using a nickname that her friends already know her by, so it's like she's just formalizing what she's been called anyway. Her fianc\u00e9 uses that name too, which shows it's a name she's been associated with.\n\nOn the other side, her mom is upset because it's a family name honoring her grandfather. The mom feels she's disrespecting that. But the person argues that she's not using the male name; the nickname is a version of her last name. So maybe the grandfather's name was the male version, and she's creating a female version. The parents didn't do that, so she's trying to find a name that fits her gender identity or personal identity better.\n\nIs changing your name a valid choice? Generally, people have the right to choose their name, especially after reaching adulthood. The parents gave her a name, but once you're an adult, you can change it if you want. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but does she have the right to make her feel guilty about it? The person is 21 and engaged, so she's making a choice for herself now. The key here is whether she's respecting her family's wishes versus her own well-being.\n\nThe main points are: she's been teased, she's using a nickname already, she's in a committed relationship, and she's changing the name to something that feels more like hers. The mother's argument is about family legacy, but the daughter is making a choice that's important for her own identity and happiness. In most cases, personal autonomy is considered important, especially when it comes to being comfortable in one's own skin. So, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong (B), because she's making a choice that's right for her, even if it upsets her family.\n"
