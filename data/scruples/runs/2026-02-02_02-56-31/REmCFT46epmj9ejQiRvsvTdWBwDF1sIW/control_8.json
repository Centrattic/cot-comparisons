My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a female nickname. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but the name is a boy's name with no female equivalent. They've faced teasing and want to use the nickname they've always used, which is based on their last name. Their mom is upset, saying they're forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They've been teased, which affects their self-esteem and social life. Using a nickname that feels like their real name makes sense for their identity and comfort. The name change is also about their engagement, which is a significant life change. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents have emotional ties to the name because it's in honor of the grandfather. The mother's disapproval is strong. But does that make the person wrong? People often change names for various reasons\u2014marriage, identity, avoiding discrimination, etc. This seems like a personal choice to align their name with how they identify and how they're perceived by others.\n\nThe mother's reaction is about the grandfather's memory, but the person is still honoring the gesture by keeping the nickname related to the last name. The key points are autonomy, the impact of the name on their life, and the fact that the nickname is already established. The mother's feelings are valid, but the person has the right to choose their name. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
