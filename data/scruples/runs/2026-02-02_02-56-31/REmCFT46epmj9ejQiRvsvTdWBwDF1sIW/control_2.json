My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their name. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person is a girl named after her grandfather, but the name is a boy's name, like \"John.\" She's been teased for it in school. Now she's 21 and wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname her friends use. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking the memory of her grandfather. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, and she's been using it socially.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for changing her name despite her mom's disapproval. \n\nWell, the person is an adult, 21 years old. At that age, they have the legal right to change their name if they choose. The fact that her parents named her after her grandfather shows a family tradition, but she's been teased for it, which affects her well-being. Using a nickname for years suggests she's already identifying with that name. Her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which might be important for her relationship and personal identity.\n\nHer mom's disapproval is significant, but as an adult, she has autonomy over her own name. While respecting her grandfather's memory is important, the person might feel that her own identity and comfort are more crucial. The parents' wishes don't override the adult child's right to make this decision for themselves. Also, the fact that there's no female version of the name could be part of the issue, leading to feeling disconnected from her given name.\n\nSo, considering autonomy, personal identity, and the impact of the name on her life, she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
