My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So, the question is about changing their name from a male name given by their parents, which was after their grandfather. The user is a girl and the name given is like a boy's name, such as John. They\u2019ve been teased for it and now at 21, engaged, wants to change both first and last names to a nickname based on their last name that friends use. Their mom is against it, saying it's forsaking their grandpa's memory, but the user feels the nickname is more like their real name now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents named the user after their grandfather, which was a gesture they appreciated, but the name isn't the female version. The user has been made fun of, which is a valid reason for wanting to change. The user is an adult now, so the right to choose their name is important. The parent's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather, but the user feels the nickname is part of their identity.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people often have the right to change their names once they're adults, especially if it affects their well-being. The parent's feelings are hurt, but the user's own comfort and identity are also significant. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname shows acceptance in their personal life. The parent's disapproval might be a conflict, but the user isn't necessarily in the wrong if they prioritize their own needs and happiness. The key here is balancing respect for family legacy with personal identity. Since the user is an adult, their decision is their own, so likely not in the wrong.\n"
