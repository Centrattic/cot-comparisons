My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, especially since their parents named them after their grandfather. The parents disapprove, but the person has been using a nickname all along and is now 21 and engaged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to choose their name. At 21, they're an adult, so legally, they can change their name if they want. The fact that they've been using a nickname for a long time suggests that the current name isn't fitting for them. They also mention being bullied at school, which is a valid concern for mental health and well-being.\n\nThe parents' disapproval is about honoring the grandfather. But does that give them the right to prevent the person from changing their name? The person isn't necessarily rejecting the grandfather's memory; they might still respect him. The parents not accepting the new name is their issue, not the person's. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows that the new name is already accepted in their personal life.\n\nAlso, names are personal. People often change names for various reasons\u2014marriage, gender identity, personal preference. The key here is the person's autonomy. Unless there's a legal issue, changing a name is a personal choice. The parents' disapproval doesn't make the person wrong. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
