  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname that's more in line with their gender identity. The name was given because of their grandfather, but it's causing them issues, especially in school due to teasing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the name change. They mention being teased, which is a significant issue. Feeling that the nickname is more their true identity and that their fianc\u00e9 uses it. That's about personal identity and comfort, which is a strong point.\n\nThe parents' reaction is about honoring the grandfather, but the person is 21 and has been using the nickname for a long time. At 21, they're an adult, so the decision to change their name is their own. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but does that make the person in the wrong? Probably not. The name change is a personal choice, especially when it's affecting their well-being.\n\nThe key factors here are personal identity, autonomy, and the impact of the name on their life. The parents' feelings are valid, but the person's right to define their own identity is also crucial. There's no clear legal or moral obligation to keep the original name, especially if it's causing distress. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
