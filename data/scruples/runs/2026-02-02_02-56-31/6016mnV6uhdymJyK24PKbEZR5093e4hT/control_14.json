My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling each other what the other thought. They're on the debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary aren't happy with each other but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nHmm. So the question is, is the author at fault here? Let's break it down. The key points are: the author didn't know them well, but overheard or found out their private feelings. Then they decided to act on that information by revealing it. The result was the breakup, which caused emotional distress. James blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor because they were incompatible.\n\nEthically, this is a tough one. On one hand, the author might have thought they were helping by ending a harmful situation. But intentionally revealing someone else's private thoughts without consent could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, the method might be questionable. Relationships are personal, and third-party interference can be problematic. The author might have crossed a line by using their position in the debate team to influence the competition, maybe even strategically to weaken their opponents. That could be seen as underhanded, but the justification is that the couple wasn't happy.\n\nBut is it their place to decide others' relationships? Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's role in exposing their private thoughts is where the controversy lies. People have the right to privacy, and relationships are complex. Even if the couple was incompatible, the author's action might have been a violation of confidentiality. However, the outcome was positive in that it ended an unhappy situation. But the method was manipulative. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the action was justified. Since the author acted to help, but without consent and in a way that caused public embarrassment, they might be at fault. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Alternatively, if others supported the action, maybe not. But the act of revealing private thoughts is where the issue lies. So probably A.\n"
