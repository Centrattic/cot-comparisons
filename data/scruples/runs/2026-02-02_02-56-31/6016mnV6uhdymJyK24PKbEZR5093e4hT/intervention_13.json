  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling each other what they really think. Let me break this down. They're part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The user found out that neither is happy in the relationship but they're staying together because of their debate partnership. The user told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James cried and blamed the user, but others thought the user helped.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the user's intention and the consequences. They wanted to help by ending a toxic situation caused by external pressures. The couple was unhappy but staying together for debate. The user's action led to immediate breakup, which caused emotional distress but also relieved their unhappiness in the long run. \n\nBut wait, was it their place to intervene? They aren't close friends, just casual acquaintances. Telling someone how their partner views them can be really hurtful. Even if the info is true, sharing it without consent might cross a boundary. The user might have thought they were doing the right thing by being honest, but relationships are complex. Maybe the couple needed to confront their issues themselves rather than have it forced.\n\nAlso, the debate aspect is a factor. The user's motivation might be partly strategic to reduce competition. That could influence their judgment. Even if they genuinely wanted to help, the method was direct and public, leading to a dramatic fallout. While others agreed it was a favor, the immediate reaction was negative. So, there's a mix of perspectives here.\n\nIn terms of ethics, meddling in others' relationships can be problematic. Even with good intentions, it's possible to cause more harm. The user might not be in the wrong because the couple was already struggling, but they did take a very active role. Alternatively, respecting their autonomy and letting them handle it themselves could be the better approach. So, the answer might swing between A and B depending on these factors.\n"
