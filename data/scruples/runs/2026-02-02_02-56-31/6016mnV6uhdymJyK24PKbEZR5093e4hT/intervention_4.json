My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. They're part of a debate team and are competing for co-captain positions. Their main competitors are a couple from different social groups, James and Mary. The user found out that they don't actually like each other but are staying together just for the debate partnership. So they told each other how the other felt, leading to a breakup in front of everyone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Was the user justified in playing matchmaker or breaking up the relationship? The user's intention was to prevent an unhappy union, but did they have the right to intervene like that? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple isn't happy, others might not have the right to meddle. However, the user argues that the breakup was beneficial in the long run since they were incompatible and only together for debate.\n\nThe user might have acted without understanding the full context. They might not know the couple's history or deeper reasons for staying together. Even if the couple is unhappy, it's up to them to decide their future. Telling each other their negative thoughts could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially if the user wasn't close to them. The immediate consequences were a public argument and James crying, which suggests emotional harm.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was indeed unhappy and the user's action led to them breaking up, maybe it was a favor. But the method of intervention was direct and perhaps harsh. The user might have overstepped by acting as a mediator or advisor without being asked. The key points are consent, intent, and the method used. The user's intent was to help, but the action might have been inappropriate regardless of the outcome. So, considering all factors, the answer might be AITA for the user because they meddled in others' relationships without permission.\n"
