My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they did the right thing by telling their competitors, who are a couple, what each other thought of them, leading to a breakup. They want to know if they're in the wrong (answer A) or not (answer B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The user is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The user found out that both are unhappy in the relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The user told each of them the other's thoughts, causing an argument and breakup. James is upset and blames the user, but others think the user helped them.\n\nNow, I need to analyze the ethics here. Was it right to intervene in their relationship? The user's intention was to help by ending an unhappy relationship that was maintained only for debate. However, relationships are personal, and the user didn't have the right to meddle. Even if the couple was unhappy, revealing private thoughts without consent could be seen as a violation of trust. The user might have thought they were being kind, but it's not their place to act as a mediator. The result was a breakup, which might have been inevitable, but the method was questionable. Others might agree the couple was incompatible, but the user's actions led to public confrontation, causing emotional distress to James. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue they prevented a forced relationship from continuing, which could affect debate performance. However, the means of revealing the information were harmful and invasive. The user should have considered other ways, like advising them to communicate if asked, rather than directly disclosing negative thoughts. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intention might have been good, the action of revealing private thoughts without consent and causing a breakup in a public and emotional manner is likely to be seen as wrong. The user overstepped boundaries, leading to harm despite the positive outcome. Therefore, the answer would be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
