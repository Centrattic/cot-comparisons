My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other really thinks. So, the scenario is that the author is on a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to an argument and a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author has a motive: they want to be co-captains and see James and Mary as competition because their relationship might help them get votes from different groups. But the author's action of revealing the partners' true feelings could be seen as meddling in their personal lives. Even if the couple wasn't happy, was it the author's place to intervene? Did they have permission to share that information?\n\nThen there's the impact. The breakup happened publicly during a meeting, and James was crying. That's a harsh outcome. The author might argue that they were doing a favor by ending an unhappy relationship that was maintained for the sake of debate, not love. Others might say the author crossed a boundary by exposing private thoughts without consent. The question is whether the ends justify the means here. Even if the couple was incompatible, the method of intervention was abrupt and public, causing emotional distress.\n\nAlso, the author's position on the debate team and their role as a potential co-captain might involve leadership responsibilities. Did they act in a way that's appropriate for a leader? Leaders should foster a healthy environment, but manipulating relationships is unethical. The author's action might damage team morale if others perceive it as underhanded.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had a right to know or share the information. If the information was obtained through casual conversations, maybe the author shouldn't have used it to interfere. The couple might not have shared their true feelings with the author in confidence, but even if they did, sharing that could violate trust.\n\nThe community's reaction, as mentioned, was that others thought the author did a favor. But the author's motivation might be questioned. Was it truly to help the couple, or was it self-serving to eliminate competition? If the latter, that's a conflict of interest and could be seen as manipulative.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty vs. privacy is a key issue. While honesty is important, revealing someone's private opinions without their consent can be harmful. The author didn't give the couple a chance to address their issues on their own terms. Instead, they forced a public confrontation, which might not have been the best approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's action was meddling in others' relationships for strategic reasons, which is generally considered wrong, even if the outcome might have been beneficial. The method used was inconsiderate and caused public humiliation. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
