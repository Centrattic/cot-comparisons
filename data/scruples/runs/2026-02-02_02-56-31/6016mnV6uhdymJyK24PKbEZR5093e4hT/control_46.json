  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a debater and wants to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author noticed that the couple isn't happy but stays together because they're debate partners. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst thought: Is it ethical to interfere in someone else's relationship? Relationships are personal, and even if there's unhappiness, it's their business. The author used information they heard casually and shared it, leading to a breakup. That's a big deal. Even if the others agreed it was a favor, the couple might not have wanted their private thoughts shared.\n\nBut then again, the couple was staying together for the sake of debate, not their actual happiness. The author's action caused immediate consequences but maybe helped them realize the incompatibility. However, the method was direct and maybe harsh. The key question is whether the author had the right to act as a mediator without being asked.\n\nAlso, James was upset and blamed the author. The author might be seen as overstepping, even if the outcome was positive. In terms of ethics, intent matters. The author thought they were helping, but the means involved invading privacy and causing public embarrassment. Even if the motives were good, the action was inappropriate. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
