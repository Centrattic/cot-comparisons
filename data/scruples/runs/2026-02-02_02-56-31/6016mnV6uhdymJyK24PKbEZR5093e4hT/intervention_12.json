My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing each other's negative thoughts. The situation involves high school debate team politics.\n\nFirst, the key points: The user is on a debate team, planning to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competitors are a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The user has overheard that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together for the debate partnership. The user then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset, but others think the user did them a favor.\n\nSo, the user is wondering if they're at fault here. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the user might argue that they were helping the couple realize their incompatibility, which was causing unhappiness. They might think that by ending the relationship, they're preventing future problems, even if it's harsh. Also, the couple's breakup might give the user's team an advantage in the elections since the opposing couple's joint ticket could lose support if they split.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's actions directly caused the breakup. Even if the couple was unhappy, it's their decision to end the relationship. The user might be overstepping by acting as a mediator or judge, using information they weren't supposed to share. Plus, the emotional impact on James, who was crying, suggests that the user's actions had a significant negative effect, even if the outcome was seen as positive by others.\n\nEthical considerations include respect for others' privacy and autonomy. The user had information about the couple's private thoughts and shared them without consent. Even if the couple was planning to break up eventually, the user accelerated the process in a public and traumatic way. The debate team environment might have a culture where such actions are common or accepted, but that doesn't necessarily make it right.\n\nAlso, the user's motivation might be partly strategic, to weaken their competitors. This could be seen as underhanded, even if the breakup was beneficial for the couple in the long run. The user might have a conflict of interest here, wanting to win the captain positions, so their judgment might be biased.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, while others agreed the user was doing a favor, that doesn't absolve them of responsibility. The immediate consequences were painful for James, and the user might be using the team's approval as a defense without considering individual harm.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the user's actions, although possibly well-intentioned, involved meddling in others' relationships and using private information, which is generally considered a breach of trust. The harm caused (public breakup, emotional distress) might outweigh the perceived benefit of ending an unhappy relationship. Therefore, the user could be in the wrong.\n"
