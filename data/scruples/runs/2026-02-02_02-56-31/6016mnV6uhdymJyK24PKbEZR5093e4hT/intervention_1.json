My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. They're part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains against another couple, James and Mary. The user found out that James and Mary don't like each other much but stayed together for the debate partnership. The user then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the user had the right to intervene. The couple's relationship was affecting their partnership, but was it the user's place to meddle? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple isn't happy, others shouldn't necessarily take it upon themselves to fix it. The user might have thought they were helping, but relationships are about the individuals involved, not others' agendas.\n\nThen, the user's motivation. They wanted to win the captain position, so their actions might have been driven by self-interest. That could make their actions less about the couple's well-being and more about their competition. Even if the outcome was the couple breaking up, the user's intent might have been manipulative.\n\nAlso, the couple's situation. They were in a unhappy relationship but stayed together for debate. The user's interference led to an argument in public, which could be seen as harsh and inconsiderate. Even if they were unhappy, the break-up was sudden and public, which might not be the best way to handle it. The user didn't give them a chance to resolve things on their own.\n\nOther people on the team agreed it was a favor, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was right. Group opinion can be biased. The user's actions caused immediate pain, especially James crying. Even if the couple wasn't happy, the way it was handled was hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the user might be in the wrong because they meddled in a personal relationship for their own benefit, even if the outcome seemed better. The method was inappropriate and could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n"
