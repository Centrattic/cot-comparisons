My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their partner, Tim, is a better debater, but the person is better at writing and politics. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The person found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The person then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. James was upset and blamed the person, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the person had the right to intervene in James and Mary's relationship. The person's intention was to help them by revealing the negative perceptions each had of the other, thinking it would end an unhappy relationship. But relationships are personal, and even if the couple is unhappy, it's their choice how to handle it. The person didn't ask for permission or consider the consequences of their actions. They might have crossed a boundary by disclosing private information, even if it was true.\n\nAlso, the fact that the breakup happened publicly during a meeting adds another layer. It could have been embarrassing for both James and Mary, especially since James was crying. The person might have prioritized their own strategy (weakening the competition) over the well-being of their peers. Even if others agreed it was a favor, that doesn't necessarily make it right. People's opinions can vary, and the person's action was a direct intervention that caused immediate harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple was staying together for reasons other than their relationship's health. The person might have thought they were doing the right thing by stopping a harmful situation. But the method of intervention was direct and without consent. It's possible that the person could have approached it differently, like suggesting they talk to each other instead of revealing the information themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, while the person's intention might have been to help, the action of revealing private information without consent and the resulting public breakup could be seen as crossing a line. So, the answer is A (in the wrong).\n"
