My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other really thinks. The situation involves debate team co-captain elections. The author, part of a debate team, is planning to run with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical implications here. The key points are the author's motivation, the method used, and the consequences. The author's intention was probably to eliminate competition by causing a breakup between James and Mary, thereby weakening their joint candidacy. However, the author claims that James and Mary were incompatible and unhappy but stayed together for debate, so the breakup might have been a favor.\n\nBut wait, even if the author believed it was for their benefit, did they have the right to act as a matchmaker? People's relationships are personal, and intervening without their consent can be problematic. Also, the author might have a conflict of interest here\u2014wanting to win the election, so manipulating the situation to their advantage. Even if others on the team agreed it was a favor, the act of revealing private thoughts without consent is invasive. The emotional impact on James, who was crying, shows the hurt caused. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple might have been in a harmful situation, and the breakup could be seen as helping them realize their incompatibility. However, the method of intervention is questionable. The author didn't try to mediate or encourage communication between James and Mary. Instead, they directly relayed negative thoughts, which led to an immediate breakup. This seems like a breach of trust, even if the outcome was beneficial.\n\nEthically, the action is a gray area. The author's intent might be to help, but the means used are questionable. In relationships, honesty is important, but the way the truth is delivered matters. The author's role in the situation is not a neutral third party; they have a stake in the outcome. Therefore, their intervention could be seen as manipulative rather than altruistic. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions likely overstepped their bounds. Even if the result was a breakup, the method of achieving it was inappropriate. People should address their own relationship issues, and the author had no right to intervene without being asked. The emotional harm caused to James, despite the potential long-term benefits, suggests that the action was wrong. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
