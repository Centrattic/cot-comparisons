My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is part of a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author finds out that both James and Mary are unhappy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset and blames the author, but others think it was a favor.\n\nSo, why is this a dilemma? The key points are whether the author had the right to intervene, the intention behind the action, and the consequences. The author's motivation was to help by ending an unhappy relationship that was maintained due to external factors (debate partnership). They believe the couple was incompatible and their breakup would be beneficial.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't ask for permission to share these thoughts. They assumed they were doing a favor without knowing if James and Mary wanted that information. Even though the result was positive (they broke up and were unhappy), the method involved deception or manipulation. Relationships are private, and inserting oneself into someone else's personal life without consent can be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe author's intent was good, but the action involved breaching trust. Even if the outcome was beneficial, the means might still be wrong. Also, the author might have overestimated their understanding of the relationship dynamics. It's possible that James and Mary had reasons to stay together despite their issues, or that the breakup caused more harm than good in other aspects of their lives.\n\nConsidering these points, while the intention was to help, the method of revealing private thoughts without consent is ethically questionable. The author didn't have the right to act as a mediator without being asked. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
