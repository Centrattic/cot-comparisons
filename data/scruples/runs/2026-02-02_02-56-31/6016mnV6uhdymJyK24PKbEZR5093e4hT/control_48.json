My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's true thoughts. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is part of a debate team and is competing for co-captain positions. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author learned that both were unhappy in their relationship but stayed together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author have a right to intervene? They believed their actions prevented an unhappy, forced relationship. But they didn't ask for permission and went straight to revealing the truths, which caused emotional distress, especially with James crying.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. On one hand, honesty can be good, but the method and intent matter. The author's motivation seems to be helping them break up for their own good, but relationships are personal. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author didn't have the right to meddle without consent. It's possible the couple wanted privacy, and the author overstepped by acting as a mediator without being asked.\n\nAlso, the consequence was immediate and public, leading to emotional harm. While the outcome might have been a breakup, the method was intrusive. The author might have thought they were doing a favor, but the way they did it was disrespectful to the couple's privacy and autonomy. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because they crossed a boundary by revealing private information without permission, even with good intentions.\n"
