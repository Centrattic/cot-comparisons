My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stayed together because of their debate partnership. Then the author told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup in front of everyone, and James was upset, blaming the author. Others thought the author was doing a favor.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author did the right thing. Let me break this down. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing their mutual dissatisfaction. But did they have the right to do that? Relationships can be complicated, and even if two people are unhappy, it's their choice whether to stay together or not. The author might have thought they were helping by ending the unhappy relationship, but maybe they crossed a boundary by spreading information they weren't supposed to. \n\nAlso, the context is a competitive environment. Maybe the author was trying to undermine their competitors by breaking them up, which could be seen as underhanded. Even if the author's intention was to help, using such a method might be unethical. Relationships are personal, and the author might not have permission to share that information. So, even if the result was positive (they broke up and were unhappy), the means of getting there could be questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, others on the team agreed the author was doing a favor. They might see it as a good outcome because it ended an unhappy partnership. But does that justify the action? The author could have approached them privately first to see if they wanted to address the relationship issues instead of just revealing everything publicly. Making such a big move in front of everyone might have been harsh, especially causing James to cry. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action might be seen as meddling in someone else's personal life without their consent. Even with good intentions, the method was invasive and potentially harmful. Therefore, the author could be at fault for breaching trust and privacy, even if the outcome was positive. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
