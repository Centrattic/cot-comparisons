My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person involved is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author noticed that James and Mary weren't really happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset and blames the author, but others think it was a favor.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the author had the right to interfere in James and Mary's relationship. The author's intention was to help by revealing the negative perceptions each had of the other, thinking it would end an unhappy but maintained relationship. However, relationships are personal, and even if the couple isn't happy, the decision to end it should ideally be theirs. The author might have acted out of concern but crossed a boundary by acting as a mediator without being asked. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple might have been staying together for the wrong reasons, and the author's intervention brought their issues to light, leading to a breakup that both might have eventually wanted. The debate team's support suggests that others saw the relationship as harmful to their happiness. But the method of intervention\u2014publicly causing a breakup during a meeting\u2014could have been harsh and unkind, especially if it led to emotional distress, like James crying.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is about respecting others' privacy and autonomy versus trying to prevent ongoing unhappiness. The author might not be in the wrong if the intention was genuine, but the action involved divulging private thoughts without consent, which can be problematic. Relationships are complex, and even if the couple's dynamic was unhealthy, it's not the author's place to play a matchmaker or breakup mediator. The outcome might have been beneficial, but the means could be seen as overstepping, especially in a professional setting like a debate team meeting.\n\nSo, considering the intent and the impact, the author might be in the wrong for mediating a personal relationship without being asked and causing public embarrassment. However, if the main point is about honesty leading to a breakup that both wanted, it's a gray area. But generally, intervening without consent leans towards the author being at fault.\n"
