My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they thought of each other. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is part of a debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The user found out that James and Mary aren't really happy in their relationship but stay together for debate. The user then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user did the right thing. The user's reasoning is that they were doing James and Mary a favor by revealing their incompatibility, even though it caused a breakup. Others on the debate team agreed that the user was right, but James was upset and blamed the user.\n\nI need to consider if the user overstepped by mediating in their personal relationship. Even if the user's intentions were good, they might have crossed a boundary by sharing private thoughts without consent. Relationships can be complex, and while the couple might have been unhappy, the user's intervention could be seen as interfering without knowing the full context.\n\nAdditionally, the user's motivation might be questioned. They mention competition for co-captains, so maybe there's an ulterior motive. But they also claim it was to help the couple. The outcome was a breakup, which made some people agree, but it's still about honesty and respect for others' privacy.\n\nIn ethical terms, is it right to act as a mediator without being asked? Even if the couple was unhappy, the user's action might have caused immediate harm (like James crying) and public embarrassment. The user might not be in the wrong if they believed they were helping, but the method of revealing private thoughts without consent is questionable. Relationships are personal, and external intervention can be harmful. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because they interfered without being asked and potentially caused more harm than good.\n"
