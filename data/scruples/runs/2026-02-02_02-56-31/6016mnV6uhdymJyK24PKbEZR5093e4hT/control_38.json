My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the author is part of a debate team and is running for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author discovers that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset and blames the author, but others on the team seem to agree the author did a favor.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Did the author have a right to intervene? The scenario mentions that the couple wasn't happy but stayed together for strategic reasons. The author's action led to the breakup, which might have been beneficial in the long run. However, the method of intervention\u2014telling each person what the other thought\u2014might be questionable. Did the author have consent to act as a mediator? Also, the consequences: James was crying, indicating emotional harm. \n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they were helping by ending an unhappy relationship. On the other hand, they crossed a boundary by revealing private thoughts without consent, which could be seen as a violation of trust. The key factors here are intent vs. consequence. The intent was to prevent an unhappy partnership, but the consequence was emotional distress and a public breakup. \n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. Was it to eliminate competition for the co-captaincy? The scenario says the author is competing with James and Mary. If the author's primary motive was to weaken the competition rather than genuinely wanting to help, that could make their action morally questionable. However, the user states that the author's main reason was concern that the couple was unhappy and staying together for the wrong reasons. \n\nSocial norms suggest that meddling in others' relationships is generally frowned upon unless there's a clear harm. Here, the couple was unhappy but in control of their own relationship. The author's intervention removed their agency to decide for themselves whether to stay or break up. Even if the author thought they were right, forcing the decision upon them could be considered wrong.\n\nIn ethics, there's a principle of autonomy\u2014respecting others' right to make their own choices. By acting as a \"fixer\" without consent, the author may have violated that principle. Even if the outcome was positive (they broke up), the act itself was a breach of trust and autonomy. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's action was a breach of privacy and autonomy, leading to emotional harm, even if the intention was to help. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
