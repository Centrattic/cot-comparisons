My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other. The scenario involves a debate team where the author, who's on the debate team, plans to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author found out that both weren't happy in the relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author acted wrongly. The key points are: the author acted as a mediator by revealing each person's negative opinions about the other. The result was the breakup, which made James cry, but others thought it was a favor because the couple was incompatible but stayed together for debate reasons.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. On one hand, the author might have done a good deed by helping them realize their incompatibility. On the other hand, they might have overstepped by not letting the couple work things out themselves. The author's intention was to help, but the method involved spreading potentially damaging information. \n\nConsider autonomy and consent. The couple wasn't given the chance to address their issues privately. The author's actions could be seen as a violation of trust if they shouldn't have shared private opinions. Also, the author might have caused emotional harm, as James was crying. However, others on the team supported the action, suggesting it was in the best interest of the team's dynamics.\n\nLegal aspects? Probably not relevant here. It's more about moral and ethical responsibility. The author's role in the situation was as a teammate, so their obligation is to the team's success, which might justify the action if it helps their own partnership's chances. But personal relationships and emotional well-being are important too.\n\nThe debate team context is crucial. If the couple's breakup improves team dynamics, maybe it's justified. But if the author acted out of self-interest (to compete for captaincy), it could be seen as manipulative. The story says the author's main concern was their own partnership's competition, so there's a self-serving motive. That might taint the action, making it more about helping their own cause rather than genuinely helping the couple.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but how it's delivered matters. The author didn't advise the couple to talk to each other but instead told each what the other thought. That bypasses communication between the couple, which is a key part of any relationship issue. By doing that, the author might have taken away their chance to confront each other directly, which could have been less traumatic.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they took it upon themselves to mediate a private relationship without the couple's consent. Even if the outcome was a breakup, the method was intrusive and could have caused unnecessary harm. The author's self-interest in the team competition adds to the ethical issue of using their position to influence others' personal lives for their own benefit.\n"
