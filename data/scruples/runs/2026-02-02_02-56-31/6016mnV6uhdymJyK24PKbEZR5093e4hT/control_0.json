My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author did the right thing by breaking up a couple, James and Mary, because they were both unhappy in the relationship but staying together for debate. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that the couple was incompatible but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author believes they were doing a favor by ending their unhappy relationship. But James is upset and blames the author. Others on the team seem to agree with the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to intervene. The author isn't close friends with either James or Mary, just knows them from debate. The key point is whether sharing someone else's private thoughts is justified, even if it leads to a positive outcome.\n\nOn one hand, the couple was unhappy and staying together for the wrong reasons. By breaking them up, maybe the author helped them find happiness. But on the other hand, the author acted as a third party, spreading what they thought were the others' opinions. Did the author have the right to meddle in their personal lives? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple is in a partnership (debate), that doesn't mean others can interfere.\n\nAlso, the author might not have the full context. Maybe James and Mary had reasons to stay together beyond just debate, or maybe their issues could have been resolved. The author's knowledge is based on casual conversations, not deep understanding. The act of revealing these thoughts could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially if the author wasn't close to them. \n\nAnother angle: the author's motives. They were trying to ensure their own partnership's success by eliminating competition. The main competition was the couple, so breaking them up would help the author's team. Is the author's self-interest valid? That might be a factor in determining if the action was right. If the author had ulterior motives, that could taint the justification.\n\nEthically, interfering in a relationship is generally frowned upon, unless there's a serious issue like abuse. Here, the issue is incompatibility. Even if the couple was unhappy, the decision to break up should be theirs. The author didn't consult them both to mediate or offer to talk, but instead took it upon themselves to share private thoughts. That seems like a breach of privacy and trust.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong. They overstepped by mediating a personal relationship between two people they aren't close to, possibly out of self-interest, and caused emotional harm. Even though the outcome was a breakup, the method was inappropriate.\n"
