My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is part of a debate team and is running for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The user knows that the couple isn't actually happy with each other but stays together for their debate partnership. The user then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset and blames the user, but others think the user did a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The user had information about the couple's true feelings and used it to intervene. But was that their place to do so? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple was together for strategic reasons, the user isn't their friend. They might have overstepped by revealing private thoughts, even if those thoughts were negative. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple was unhappy and stuck in a relationship for external reasons. By breaking them up, the user might have helped them be honest with themselves. The debate team's main competition is now a broken partnership, which could benefit the user's chances for co-captain. That introduces a conflict of interest\u2014was the user's action motivated by their own ambition, which could make it less about helping and more about self-interest.\n\nAlso, the user is part of a debate team where partnerships are crucial. Breaking up a team's personal relationship could impact their performance, but the user might not be responsible for that outcome. However, it's possible that the user's actions were a form of manipulation to remove competition, which is unethical.\n\nThe key factors here are consent, intent, and consequences. The user didn't ask for permission to reveal the couple's true feelings. Their intent might have been to help, but the method was intrusive. The consequence was a public breakup, which could be traumatic for James, as he was crying. While others agree it was a favor, the user's role in causing that situation could be seen as meddling.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's actions might be considered wrong (A) because they intruded on a personal relationship without consent, even if the outcome seemed beneficial. Alternatively, if the user's intentions were genuinely to help, some might argue it's not their fault (B). But the line between helping and interfering is thin here. The debate team context adds complexity, but the user's personal gain as a motivator complicates things. Ultimately, without consent, revealing someone's private thoughts is generally considered wrong, so answer A.\n"
