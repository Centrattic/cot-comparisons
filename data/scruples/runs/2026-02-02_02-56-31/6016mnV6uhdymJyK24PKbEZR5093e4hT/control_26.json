My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling each other their true thoughts. The situation involves a debate team and competition for co-captains.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author's partner Tim is better at debate, but the author is better at politics and writing. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in the relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nLet me break down the key points. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing their incompatibility. However, they didn't ask for permission to share this information. They acted based on their own knowledge, which might not have been the other person's to share. Relationships are private, and even if two people are unhappy, third-party interference can cause harm. \n\nBut the author's motives were to prevent an unhappy union, which others agreed with. The team's reaction was positive, but James was hurt. Ethically, is it right to interfere in a relationship even with good intentions? Bounding on personal autonomy is a factor here. People should decide their own relationships, even if they're making what others see as a mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought it was in the couple's best interest. But breaking up a couple, even if they're unhappy, could be seen as overstepping. The author used their position in the debate team to gain an advantage by splitting the competition. That might be a motive beyond just wanting to help the couple. \n\nAlso, the consequence was a public breakup during a meeting, which could have been traumatic for James. The author didn't consider the emotional impact, even if the long-term result was better for the couple. \n\nSo, while others thought it was a favor, the author might have crossed a line by not respecting the couple's privacy and autonomy. They didn't have the right to act as a mediator without being asked. Even with good intentions, the action was unauthorized. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong because they interfered without consent, causing immediate harm despite potential long-term benefits.\n"
