  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for breaking up a couple by revealing each other's true thoughts. They're on the debate team and want to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The user found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of debate. The user told each of them what the other thought, causing a breakup during a meeting. James cried and blamed the user, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nHmm, the key points here are intent and consequences. The user's intention was to help them break up because they were unhappy and only together for debate. But did they overstep by revealing others' private thoughts? The user might have thought it was for their benefit, but relationships are personal, and airing grievances without consent can be harmful. Even if it led to a positive outcome, the method was invasive. Others supported it because they saw the incompatibility, but the act of revealing private thoughts can be seen as a breach of trust. So, while the outcome might have been good, the action itself could be considered wrong because it involved meddling in their private lives without permission. The user might have crossed a line, making them at fault regardless of the outcome.\n"
