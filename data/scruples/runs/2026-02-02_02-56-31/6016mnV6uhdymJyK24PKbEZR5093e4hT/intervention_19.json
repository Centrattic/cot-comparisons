  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is on a debate team and their partner, Tim, is running for co-captain with them. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The user discovers that James and Mary don't actually like each other but are staying together for the sake of their debate partnership. The user then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset and blames the user, but others on the team agree it was a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The user's intention was to expose the incompatibility between James and Mary, believing that their relationship was only sustained because of the debate partnership. The user might think they're helping them by ending the fake relationship. But did they overstep by acting as a mediator without being asked?\n\nJames and Mary's relationship issues are personal. Even if the user knows they're unhappy, spreading those opinions could be seen as betrayal. The user didn't ask for permission or offer a solution; they just revealed each person's negative thoughts. That could be hurtful and public, especially in a professional setting like a debate meeting. James being emotional shows the impact of this action.\n\nOn the other hand, the team agrees that the couple was incompatible. The user's action might have prevented a fake partnership that could affect the team's dynamics. But is it the user's responsibility to interfere? Relationships, even if influenced by professional goals, are personal matters. The user might have crossed a line by not letting the couple handle it themselves.\n\nThere's also the aspect of intent versus outcome. The user intended to help, but the method was direct and confrontational. Maybe they should have approached it differently, like talking to each person privately to understand if they wanted to break up. Instead, they made the conflict public, which could have been more traumatic for James and Mary.\n\nSo, the user's action might be seen as well-meaning but misjudged. They interfered in a personal matter without considering the proper way to handle it. While the team agrees with the outcome, the method was questionable. The user could be in the wrong for not respecting the couple's privacy and autonomy in handling their relationship.\n"
