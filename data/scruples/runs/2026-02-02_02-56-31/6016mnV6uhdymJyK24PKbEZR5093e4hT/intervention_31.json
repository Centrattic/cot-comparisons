My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by breaking up a couple (James and Mary) because they knew each other's negative thoughts. The context is that the couple's relationship was affecting their debate team's competition, and the user wanted to eliminate that threat by causing them to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The user knew the couple was unhappy but stayed together for debate. By revealing their mutual negative opinions, the user directly caused the breakup. Even if the couple was unhappy, was it right for the user to intervene? \n\nIntention matters. The user's intent was strategic, to weaken their competition. But the means were deceitful\u2014spreading the other's criticisms. That feels manipulative. Even if the outcome was positive (they broke up and were happier), the method involved betrayal of trust. \n\nAlso, the user isn't close friends with either, so they might not have the right to meddle in their relationship. The breakup happened publicly, causing James to cry. That suggests emotional harm. The user's actions were self-serving, aiming to win, not genuinely helping the couple. So even if others agreed, the user acted out of personal interest, which is a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the couple was better off breaking up. But the user shouldn't have been the one to do it. The right approach would have been to let the couple handle their issues themselves. So, I think the user is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
