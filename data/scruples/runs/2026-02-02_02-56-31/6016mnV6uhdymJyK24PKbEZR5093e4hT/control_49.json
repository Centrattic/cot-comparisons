My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a debate team member who broke up a couple by telling each other what they thought of the other. The writer is asking if they're the asshole here (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is part of the debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner. They mention that their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The writer learned that both weren't happy in the relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The writer then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the writer have the right to intervene? Was it their place to spread the information they overheard? The writer claims to have done it out of a sense of doing a favor, as the couple was incompatible but stayed together for the sake of debate. Others on the team agreed it was a favor, but James was upset and crying.\n\nI need to think about the intent. The writer's intention was to help the couple by revealing their mutual negative feelings, which might have been affecting their dynamic. However, relationships are personal, and even if the couple was unhappy, sharing private thoughts without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The writer might have crossed a line by acting as a mediator without being asked.\n\nEthically, it's complicated. On one hand, the couple was using the partnership to stay together despite being unhappy. On the other hand, the writer didn't ask for permission to share such personal information. Even if the information is true, disseminating it without the couple's consent could be harmful. It's possible that the writer assumed they were helping, but relationships are sensitive, and their actions might have caused more harm than good, especially considering the emotional impact on James.\n\nAlso, the writer's motivation might be partially self-serving. By breaking up the couple, they might be reducing competition for the co-captain role. However, they don't explicitly state this as a motive, so it's speculative. The main stated reason is wanting to help the couple.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally advised not to interfere in others' relationships unless they're directly asking for help. The writer acted without being asked, which could be seen as overstepping. Even if the outcome was positive (the breakup), the method used was invasive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the writer might be in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, leading to a breakup that was painful for one party. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the approach was intrusive. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of consent and the direct involvement in causing the breakup.\n"
