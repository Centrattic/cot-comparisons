My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thinks. The scenario involves debate team co-captain elections.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and planning to run with their partner, Tim. They're competing against another couple, James and Mary. The author knows that James and Mary are unhappy in their relationship but stay together for debate partnership reasons. So the author tells each of them what the other thinks negatively, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did the right thing. The author's reasoning is that the couple was incompatible and their breakup would help them be happier. Others on the team seem to agree they were doing a favor. However, James blames the author and was crying. \n\nI need to consider if the author crossed a line. Telling someone how another person feels, especially negative things, could be seen as meddling. Even if the intention was to help, the method might be problematic. Relationships are complex, and people might not want others' opinions shared, even if they're true. The author's role in causing a public argument and breakup could be seen as interfering in a personal matter, regardless of the outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple was unhappy and staying together for the sake of debate. The author might believe they were helping them realize the truth. But the act of revealing those thoughts without consent is a breach of trust. Even if the outcome is positive, the means could be unethical. So, the author's actions might be considered wrong because they used private information to manipulate the situation, leading to public humiliation and emotional distress, even if the result seemed beneficial to others. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
