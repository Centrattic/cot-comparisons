My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they think of each other. The scenario is set in a high school debate team where the author is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups.\n\nThe author overheard or knew that James and Mary weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup. James was upset, crying, and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Did the author have a right to intervene? The author's motivation was to help them by ending an unhappy relationship that was sustained only for the sake of debate. But relationships are personal, and intervening without consent could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nEven if the author's intention was good, the method might be questionable. The author didn't ask for permission to meddle in their relationship. They took it upon themselves to act as a matchmaker or breakup agent. This could be considered a breach of trust or privacy. \n\nAnother angle: the author is aware that the couple's relationship is affecting the debate team's dynamics. If the breakup would lead to a more focused and effective debate team, maybe the author's action was in the interest of the team. However, that's a utilitarian view and might not justify the means used.\n\nJames and Mary's perspectives are important. James was crying, indicating emotional distress. Even if Mary and James were unhappy, breaking up a relationship can have lasting emotional consequences. The author might not have considered the potential fallout beyond the immediate situation.\n\nBut the other team members agreed it was a favor. Maybe they saw the relationship as a hindrance. The author's position might be supported by some, but does that make it right? The author should have considered whether they had the right to act as a middleman. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial, but the author's role here isn't as an objective third party. They have a personal stake in the outcome as a competitor. This could bias their judgment. The author might have acted out of self-interest to eliminate competition, which could be a hidden motive.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action might be seen as meddling in a personal matter without the right to do so. Even if the outcome seemed beneficial, the method was intrusive. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong.\n"
