My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. The scenario is a high school debate team where the user's partner and them are planning to run for co-captains. The main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The user found out that both James and Mary aren't happy with each other but stay together for the sake of their debate partnership. The user then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting, with James crying and blaming the user. Others thought it was a favor because they were incompatible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The user had information about the couple's private feelings and decided to share it without their consent. Even if the user's intention was to help them realize the incompatibility, did they have the right to do that? Relationships are personal, and sharing such information can be seen as a breach of privacy. The user might argue that it was for their own good, but that's a classic \"I meant well\" defense.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple was staying together not because of love but because of professional reasons (debate partnership). The user's action might have saved them from a continuing unhappy relationship. However, the method used was direct and public, leading to immediate conflict and emotional distress. The user didn't seek to mediate or give them a chance to address the issues privately. Instead, they exposed each other's negative perceptions in a meeting, which could be seen as a lack of tact.\n\nAnother point is the impact on the debate team. The user's actions might have affected team dynamics, but the question is about moral wrong. The user's role as a debater might involve critical thinking, but this is a personal situation. Also, the user is part of an existing partnership and might have a motive to eliminate competition, which could be a hidden agenda. Is the user's action motivated purely by concern for the couple, or is there a strategic element in weakening the competition?\n\nThe couple's breakup could be beneficial in the long run if they were truly incompatible. However, the manner in which it happened\u2014public argument and emotional fallout\u2014might be considered harsh. The user didn't consider the emotional consequences on James, who was crying and blamed the user. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the user's responsibility towards James and Mary's well-being is a factor.\n\nIn terms of consent, the user didn't ask either James or Mary if they wanted to know what the other thought. They assumed that sharing this information would be helpful, but that's an assumption. Relationships are complex, and even if the couple was unhappy, the decision to break up should ideally come from them, not from an external party.\n\nThere's also the aspect of honesty. The user is telling the truth about the couple's mutual perceptions, but honesty doesn't always equate to ethical behavior when it causes harm. The user's action here is a form of honesty, but it's delivered in a way that's damaging. The question is whether the truth was necessary to tell in that manner and context.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the user might be in the wrong because they intervened without consent, caused immediate public conflict, and possibly acted out of self-interest in a competitive scenario. While the outcome might have been beneficial for the couple in the long run, the method and lack of discretion make the action questionable.\n"
