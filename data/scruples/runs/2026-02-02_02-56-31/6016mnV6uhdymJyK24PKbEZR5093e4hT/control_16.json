My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about someone on a debate team who breaks up a couple by telling each what the other thinks. The author, part of a debate team, plans to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author noticed that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of the debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author's intention was to help them break up because they were incompatible but stayed together for debate reasons. The author believed they were doing a favor, and others on the team agreed. However, James was upset and blamed the author.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the author have the right to intervene? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple is in a partnership for debate, sharing private thoughts without consent could be a breach of trust. The author might have thought they were helping, but inserting themselves into a private relationship can be seen as overstepping. However, if the couple was unhappy and staying together for work, breaking it up might have been beneficial in the long run for their well-being.\n\nBut the method matters. The author acted as a mediator by revealing personal opinions, which could be seen as gossiping or meddling. Even if the outcome was positive (breaking up an unhappy relationship), the means might not justify the end. The author didn't get consent from either James or Mary to share their thoughts. In relationships, communication is key, but it's the couple's responsibility to address the issues themselves unless there's a direct impact on others.\n\nIn a team setting, if their partnership affects the team's dynamics, maybe intervention is justified. However, the author's role as a debater doesn't necessarily give them the authority to disrupt a personal relationship unless the team leaders are involved. The author's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the outcome was seen as positive by others.\n\nAnother angle: the author is part of the debate team and competing. There's a potential conflict of interest here. The author might have done this to eliminate competition or to help their own team dynamics. However, the story doesn't explicitly state that the breakup was done out of self-interest, but it's a possible underlying motive.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's action might be considered a breach of privacy. Even if the information was accurate (James thinks Mary is idealistic and boring, Mary thinks James is a big mouth), spreading that could be seen as harmful. However, if the couple was unhappy and the author's action led to a mutually beneficial breakup, it's a gray area.\n\nThe response from others agreeing that it was a favor suggests that the community saw it as a positive outcome. But individual responsibility in relationships is important. The author might have been acting in their own interests or genuinely wanting to help, but the method was intrusive.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer isn't straightforward. But typically, in ethical terms, interfering in someone else's personal relationship without their consent is generally seen as wrong, even with good intentions. However, if the relationship was harmful to both parties and the intervention helped them realize it, it could be seen as justified. The line is blurry here, but the act of sharing private thoughts without permission is a key issue.\n"
