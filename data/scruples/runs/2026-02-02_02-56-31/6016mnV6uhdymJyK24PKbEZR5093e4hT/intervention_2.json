  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by breaking up a couple, Tim and Mary, by telling each what the other thought of them. They're part of a debate team and competing for co-captain positions. The user's partner is Tim, who's a better debater, but the user is better at politics and writing.\n\nSo the user found out that James and Mary, the couple, weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The user told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup. Now James is upset, blaming the user, but others think the user did the right thing.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, the user had information that the couple was incompatible and unhappy. They used that info to tell each other the bad things, which caused the breakup. The user's intent was probably to help them by ending the fake relationship. But did they overstep?\n\nEthically, is it okay to interfere in someone else's relationship? Even if the couple is unhappy, does the user have the right to act as a mediator? Maybe the couple wanted to handle it themselves. By revealing the truth, the user might have caused emotional harm to James, even if Mary and James were unhappy. Also, the user's motivation might be partly strategic to eliminate competition, which could be a factor.\n\nOn the other hand, if the relationship was a facade and hurting both parties, the user's action might have been a favor. But relationships are complex, and people might not appreciate others deciding for them. The user's role as a debate teammate adds another layer. Should they have focused on the competition instead of personal matters?\n\nIt's a tough call. The user's actions had consequences, and while the outcome was a breakup, the method might be questionable. So, the answer hinges on whether the user overstepped their role and whether the intent was purely altruistic or had an ulterior motive. Given that the user is competing against the couple, there's a conflict of interest. Therefore, even if the result was good, the user might be in the wrong for interfering.\n"
