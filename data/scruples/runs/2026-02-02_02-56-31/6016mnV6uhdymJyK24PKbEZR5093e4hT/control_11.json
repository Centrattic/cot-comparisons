My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who broke up the couple by telling each other what they thought is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is part of a debate team. They and their partner (Tim) are running for co-captains. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much\u2014Mary thinks James is a \"big mouth, small brain\" and James thinks Mary is too idealistic and boring. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. James blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had the information that James and Mary didn't really get along, and they told each other. The breakup happened, causing James to cry. Others thought it was a good thing because the couple was incompatible. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. The ethical angle here is about honesty and the consequences. On one hand, the author might have done the couple a favor by ending a fake relationship. On the other hand, they might have overstepped by revealing personal thoughts without consent. \n\nIn many situations, people in relationships might not communicate their true feelings because of external pressures, like in this case, the debate partnership. The author could argue that by revealing their true feelings, they helped both parties realize the relationship was untenable. However, the act of revealing personal, potentially hurtful information without being asked could be seen as a breach of privacy or trust. \n\nJames and Mary were in a relationship, so they had a certain expectation of privacy. The author, as a third party, might not have the right to meddle in their personal matters unless there was a clear justification. But the justification here is that the couple was keeping the relationship alive solely for the sake of their debate partnership, not because of genuine affection. \n\nThe outcome was a breakup that caused emotional pain (James was crying), but others on the team agreed it was a favor. The debate here is between the intention (helping them by revealing the truth) and the method (interfering without consent). \n\nIn ethical terms, intent matters but so does the means. If the author's intention was to prevent a harmful situation (an unhappy relationship), but the method was intrusive, it's a gray area. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn some contexts, people might argue that it's not the author's place to meddle in others' relationships, regardless of the outcome. Others might think that since the couple was using the relationship for debate purposes and it was causing unhappiness, the author did the right thing. \n\nBut legally and socially, people have a right to privacy in their relationships. Even if the author believed they were helping, the act of disclosing private thoughts without permission could be seen as wrong. The fact that James blamed the author and it caused emotional distress might tip the scales towards the author being in the wrong, even if others agree with the outcome. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer could lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but there's a counterargument for B. However, the key point is whether the author crossed a line by revealing private information. Even if the result was positive, the action itself (without consent) might be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
