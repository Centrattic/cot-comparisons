My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they think of each other. The situation involves a debate team where the author is planning to run for co-captains with their partner. The competition is another team that's a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author found out that they don't really like each other but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's intention was to help them realize their incompatibility, but did they have the right to do so? Were they the right person to act as a mediator or to reveal such personal information? \n\nOn one hand, the couple was unhappy but staying together for strategic reasons in debate. The author's actions led to their breakup, which might have freed them from an unhappy relationship. Others on the team agreed that the author was doing a favor, which suggests there's social support for this action. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped by revealing personal thoughts without consent. Relationships are private, and even if the couple was together for strategic reasons, the author's interference could be seen as a breach of trust. James was upset and blamed the author, which indicates some harm was caused, even if unintended.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the right to privacy. The author might not have known the full context of the relationship dynamics beyond what they overheard. Also, breaking up a couple in a public setting during a meeting seems tactless. Even if the outcome was positive, the method might be questionable.\n\nBut considering the context of a high school debate team where strategic partnerships are crucial, the author's motivation was to ensure the competition was fair. However, the means used could be ethically dubious. The author might not be in the wrong if the intention was to help, but the method and lack of discretion could make them at fault.\n\nI think there's a balance here. The author's action had a justified cause but was executed in a way that could be seen as violating personal boundaries. So, the answer might be that the author is partially at fault. But according to the options given, it's either A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the community's response in the scenario (others agreeing), but also the personal invasion, it's a bit tricky. However, the consensus in these AITA scenarios often sides with the person if their actions had good intentions and the outcome was positive. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
