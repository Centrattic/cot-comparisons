  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. They're part of a debate team, and they're trying to get co-captain positions with their partner. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The user found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stay together for debate. The user told them the truth about each other's opinions, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset, but others think the user did a favor.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the user did the right thing. Let's break it down. The user's intention was to help James and Mary by being honest, but the method was revealing each other's negative opinions, which caused a public breakup. \n\nFirst, the user's action was based on their knowledge from casual conversations. Is it ethical to spread what you hear about someone? Even if it's true, spreading others' private thoughts can be harmful. Also, the user is in a position where they have a conflict of interest\u2014since they want to beat James and Mary for co-captain positions. So maybe their motivation isn't purely altruistic. They might have wanted to eliminate competition by breaking up the couple.\n\nThen, the consequence was a public argument and breakup. James was crying, which shows emotional impact. Even if the relationship was unhappy, the way it was handled was disruptive and possibly cruel. The user might have crossed a line by using this information to damage their partnership, perhaps to gain an advantage.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the couple was already in a harmful relationship and the user helped them end it. But the right to decide that is questionable. Others might say that the user didn't have the right to meddle in their personal lives, regardless of the situation.\n\nSo, considering intent and consequences, the user's actions were manipulative and could be seen as interfering for personal gain. Even if the outcome was beneficial, the method was unethical. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
