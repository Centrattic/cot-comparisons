My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their partner is a better debater, but they're better at politics and writing. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author discovered that the couple isn't actually happy together because of their differences and the fact that they're in a debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo the question is, was it the right thing to do? The author's reasoning is that by keeping the relationship, they were unhappy and it might affect their debate performance. Others on the team seem to agree it was a favor. But James was upset and blamed the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author acted as a mediator of sorts, revealing each partner's true feelings. But was that their place to do? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple is in a partnership, others might not have the right to intervene. The author might argue that they were doing it for the good of the team and to help the couple be honest. However, intentionally causing a breakup can be seen as interfering in a personal matter. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author could have encouraged open communication without revealing the negative opinions. It's possible that the breakup could have been avoided if the couple had talked openly without third-party intervention. Additionally, causing an emotional scene during a meeting might have been unprofessional, even if the intention was good. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author's actions led to a healthier dynamic long-term and prevented the couple from staying together for the wrong reasons, maybe it was justified. But the method of revealing the thoughts might be the issue. The key is whether the author had the right to act as a go-between. Even if the couple was incompatible, it's their relationship to manage. The author might have overstepped by directly sharing the negative opinions, which can be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be questioned. They mention their own competition with the couple for co-captain positions. Could there be an element of wanting to eliminate competition by breaking them up? Even if that's not the case, the perception might exist. \n\nIn terms of the debate team's reaction, others agreed it was a favor, but that's not necessarily a sign the action was right. The team might have a different perspective, but personal relationships are complex. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled in a personal relationship without being asked, which can be seen as crossing a boundary. Intentional breakup of a partnership, even if for perceived good reasons, can be considered unethical unless there's a clear mandate to do so. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
