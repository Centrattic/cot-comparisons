My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they think of each other. The scenario involves a debate team where the author is trying to run for co-captains with their partner, and they're competing against another couple who might be a threat because they can get votes from different social groups.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author knew that the couple, James and Mary, had a strained relationship but were staying together because of their debate partnership. The author decided to tell each of them what the other thought negatively about them, which led to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, while others thought the author was doing them a favor by ending an unhappy relationship.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention might have been to help the couple by revealing each other's true feelings, which they had been hiding due to their mutual dependency on the debate team. The author could argue that the couple wasn't truly happy and that the breakup was inevitable, just accelerated. The fact that others supported the action suggests that the author's intervention was seen as beneficial.\n\nOn the other hand, the author intentionally caused a confrontation by sharing private opinions, which led to public embarrassment and emotional distress. Even if the relationship wasn't healthy, the method of intervention\u2014spreading negative thoughts without consent\u2014could be considered manipulative or harmful. The author's motive might also be questioned; was it genuinely for the couple's benefit, or was it a strategic move to eliminate competition for the captain position?\n\nI need to weigh the ethical implications. While the outcome might have helped the couple realize their incompatibility, the act of revealing private thoughts without permission is a breach of trust. Relationships are complex, and even if the couple was unhappy, the author's interference disrupted their partnership, which could have consequences beyond just the breakup, like affecting their debate performance and personal well-being.\n\nAdditionally, the author's potential ulterior motive (gaining an advantage in the election) might undermine the altruistic claim. If the primary reason was to weaken the competition, then the action is more self-serving and ethically questionable.\n\nConsidering all factors, even if the outcome was positive, the method used might make the author responsible. Relationships are built on trust and communication, and the author's role in exposing hidden tensions without permission could be seen as a violation of that trust. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong regardless of the outcome.\n"
