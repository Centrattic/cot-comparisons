My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. They\u2019re on the debate team and their partner is running for co-captains with them. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The user found out that James and Mary don't really like each other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The user told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting, and James was upset, but others agreed it was a favor.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about honesty and the consequences. The user knew the couple was unhappy but staying together for strategic reasons. By revealing the negative opinions, they caused a breakup. The question is whether that's acceptable or not.\n\nOn one hand, maybe the user thought they were helping by ending an unhappy relationship. The couple might not have broken up otherwise because they were both holding on for debate reasons. Others supported the action, seeing it as a favor.\n\nBut on the other hand, intervening in someone else's relationship can be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the couple had issues, it's their choice to handle. The user's motivation might be strategic to eliminate competition, which complicates things. If the user's main reason was to sabotage their rivals, that's manipulative. If it was genuinely to help the couple, maybe less so. But the line between helping and meddling is thin here.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact: James was crying, so the user's action had a significant negative effect. Even if others agreed, the method of intervention was direct and led to public embarrassment or conflict. Trust is another factor\u2014should the user have trusted the couple to handle it themselves?\n\nSo, considering these factors, is the user in the wrong? If their intent was to benefit their own team's chances and they took advantage of the couple's situation, that's more problematic. But if they were genuinely trying to help, maybe not. However, without the couple's consent to intervene, it's usually considered meddling. The debate team context adds a strategic layer, but personal relationships are complex. The answer might hinge on the user's intent and how they approached the situation. Since the user's primary motivation seems tied to their own goals (winning co-captain), the action might be seen as manipulative. Therefore, the user could be at fault for using the information to their advantage rather than genuinely helping the couple.\n"
