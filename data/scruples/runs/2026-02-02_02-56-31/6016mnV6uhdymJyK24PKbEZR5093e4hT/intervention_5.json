My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by breaking up a couple, Tim and Mary, by telling each other what they really thought. The context is that they're all part of a debate team, and the user is trying to position themselves and their partner for co-captain roles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user knew that James and Mary were unhappy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The user told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the user, but others thought the user was helping them realize their incompatibility.\n\nSo, the main ethical dilemma here is about interfering in others' relationships, even with good intentions. The user's motivation was to eliminate competition by breaking up the couple, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if the user's actions led to a positive outcome (the couple breaking up because they were unhappy), the method of achieving it might be questionable. \n\nThe user's role in this situation is crucial. By acting as a mediator or a truth-teller, they might have thought they were helping, but without the couple's consent, it's a form of betrayal. Relationships are personal, and sharing private opinions without permission can be harmful. Even if the couple was unhappy, the user's intervention caused public embarrassment and emotional distress, especially James crying.\n\nOn the other side, if the couple was indeed incompatible and the breakup was inevitable, maybe the user just accelerated the process. However, the user's primary motive might have been strategic (to compete for co-captain roles) rather than purely altruistic. This adds a layer of self-interest that complicates the situation.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. The breakup happened publicly during a meeting, which could have damaged the couple's reputation and affected the debate team's dynamics. The user's actions, even if well-intentioned, disrupted the team's stability for their own benefit. That's a negative point.\n\nBut then, others on the team agreed with the user, suggesting that the breakup was a relief. If the couple's relationship was a strain on the team, maybe the user did help. However, the method of intervention was direct and invasive, which might still be wrong regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn ethical terms, intent and action matter. The user's intent was to help the couple realize their incompatibility, but the method was deceitful and invasive. The action of revealing private thoughts without consent is a violation of trust, which is a serious issue. Even if the result was positive, the means were problematic.\n\nSo, the user might be in the wrong because they meddled in a personal relationship without consent, using information they shouldn't have shared. The fact that they did it for strategic reasons (to boost their own team's chances) adds to the wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
