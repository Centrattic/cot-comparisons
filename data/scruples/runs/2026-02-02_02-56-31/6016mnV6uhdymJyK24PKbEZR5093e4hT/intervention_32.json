My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing their negative thoughts. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the user is part of a debate team and they're planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The user knows that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The user told each of them what the other thought, leading to a public breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the user, but others thought the user was right because the couple was incompatible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The user acted on information they had, thinking they were helping. But did they overstep by revealing private thoughts without consent? Relationships can be complex, and even if the couple isn't happy, breaking them up isn't necessarily the user's place. The user's motivation was to help them realize their incompatibility, but relationships are personal, and outsiders shouldn't meddle unless there's a clear harm.\n\nAlso, the context is competitive\u2014maybe the user wanted to eliminate competition. But the user claims it's not about competition, just about helping them. However, the outcome might have been influenced by their own interests. The debate team's reaction is mixed: James is upset, but others agree. But public breakup led to emotional distress, which the user might have caused.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user didn't have the couple's permission to act as a mediator. Even if the couple was unhappy, the user's intervention might have been unnecessary and invasive. Relationships are between two people, and third parties shouldn't impose their solutions. So, the user might be in the wrong for interfering without being asked, despite good intentions.\n"
