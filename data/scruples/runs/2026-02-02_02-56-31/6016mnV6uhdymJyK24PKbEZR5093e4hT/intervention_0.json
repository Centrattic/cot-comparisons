  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. So, the situation is they're on a debate team, aiming for co-captain positions. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The user found out through casual talks that both are unhappy in the relationship but stay together for debate. The user then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The user isn't friends with either, just knows them through debate. They acted based on what they overheard or were told, then decided to intervene. The outcome was immediate breakup, with James crying and blaming the user, but others agreed it was a favor.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, spreading someone else's private thoughts without consent is usually considered a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, they didn't ask Mary or James if they wanted to know those things. Relationships are complex, and while the couple might have been unhappy, the user took it upon themselves to end it without knowing the full context. Maybe there were reasons they stayed together beyond just debate. Also, causing a scene in a meeting might have been unkind and public.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple was unhappy and staying together for external reasons. The user's actions led to their breakup, which some might see as helping. But the method\u2014without consent and in a public setting\u2014could be problematic. The user might have overstepped their role, especially not being close friends. Even if the outcome was positive, the means used could be questionable. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they meddled without permission, but others might say B (not wrong) because they helped the couple. However, respecting privacy and consent is key here. So, likely A.\n"
