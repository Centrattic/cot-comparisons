My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing their mutual negative thoughts. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary were unhappy in their relationship but stayed together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted as a mediator by revealing each person's true feelings. The result was a breakup that made James emotional and upset, but others on the team thought it was a favor.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Intervening in someone else's relationship is tricky. Even if the couple was incompatible, the author's role as a friend or teammate doesn't necessarily give them the right to meddle. The author might have thought they were helping, but relationships are personal. Telling each other their thoughts without permission could be seen as a breach of trust. Both James and Mary might have wanted to keep their feelings private, even if they were mutual. The author's action led to public embarrassment and emotional distress, which can be hurtful regardless of the outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple stayed together not out of genuine affection but because of external pressures (debate partnership). The author might have believed that their actions freed the couple from an unhappy situation. However, the method was confrontational and public, which is a questionable approach. The intention was good, but the execution was poor.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a difference between wanting to help and respecting boundaries. The author overstepped by not discussing this privately with each individual first, perhaps giving them space to decide. Also, using their position within the debate team to create conflict could be seen as manipulative, especially if it's to benefit their own partnership's chances.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might have been to help, the act of revealing private thoughts without consent and in a public setting likely caused more harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
