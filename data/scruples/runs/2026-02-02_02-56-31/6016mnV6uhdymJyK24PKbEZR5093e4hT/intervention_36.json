My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether they did the right thing by breaking up a couple (James and Mary) to help their debate team's chances. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is part of a debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, who are a couple but from different social groups. The user found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in the relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The user then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the user, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nHmm, so the user's motivation was to eliminate competition by causing the breakup, which seems self-serving. Even if the couple was unhappy, the user's action was intentional to benefit their own goals. While the breakup might have been inevitable, the user played a direct role in accelerating it. There's a line between helping people realize their incompatibility and manipulating the situation for personal gain. The user might not have malicious intent, but the context here is about personal advantage in a competitive setting. \n\nEthically, is it right to interfere in someone else's relationship, even if you think you're helping? The user's action caused immediate emotional distress (James crying), which is a negative consequence. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the user's primary motive was to weaken the competition. That could be seen as exploiting the situation. On the other hand, if the couple was already on bad terms and the breakup was going to happen, maybe the user just sped up the process. But the key point is intent and the method used. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, honesty is valued, but also the intent behind the action. If the user genuinely believed they were helping and didn't anticipate the emotional fallout, maybe it's more neutral. However, the user did anticipate the competition and strategically decided to intervene. That makes it more about self-interest. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they used the information to gain an advantage, causing harm in the process. But others might argue B (not in the wrong) because it led to a positive outcome for the couple in the long run. However, the means justify the ends here? Probably not. So leaning towards A.\n"
