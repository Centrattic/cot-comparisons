My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling each other their true thoughts. They're on a debate team and want to run for co-captains, and their main competition is a couple from different social groups. The author found out that the couple, James and Mary, have a lot of issues but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. Let's break it down. Intentionally causing a breakup by revealing negative opinions might be seen as interfering. But the couple was already unhappy and staying together for the partnership. The author's motive was to get the co-captain position, so maybe there's an ulterior motive. However, the outcome was that they broke up because they were incompatible. Others on the team agreed it was a favor.\n\nBut is it the author's place to meddle in their relationship? Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's action was direct and caused immediate conflict. However, the couple might not have broken up otherwise. So, depending on the perspective: if the author acted out of self-interest, that's bad. But if the couple was genuinely unhappy and the author helped them realize it, maybe it's justified. It's a bit of a gray area. But in terms of ethics, usually, you don't meddle in others' relationships, even if they're unhappy. The author might have overstepped, even if the result was positive. So, maybe the author is at fault. But the answer depends on whether the action was justified by the outcome. The question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which often considers intent and context. Since the author had a personal motive and caused direct harm (James crying), maybe they are in the wrong. Alternatively, if the couple was already doomed, maybe not. Hmm. The answer is likely A (yes) because they meddled, but some might say B. Need to decide based on typical AITA standards. Usually, people are in the wrong for causing breakups unless it's to stop harm. Here, the couple was unhappy but not necessarily harmful. So maybe A is correct.\n"
