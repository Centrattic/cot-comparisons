My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author breaking up a debate team couple by telling each of them what the other really thought. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is part of a debate team and is running for co-captain with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author noticed that James and Mary were unhappy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them the negative things the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. James blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are: intent, harm caused, and whether the action was justified.\n\nThe author's intent was to help James and Mary by revealing the truth about their incompatibility, which others agreed with. However, the method used might be questionable. By directly telling each person what the other thought, the author acted as a mediator but without their consent. Relationships are complex, and even if the couple was unhappy, the author's intervention led to a public breakup and James crying. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have believed they were doing the right thing by ending a harmful situation. But on the other hand, they crossed a boundary by sharing private sentiments without permission. The couple might have preferred to handle the issue themselves, even if it was difficult. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, as they decided that the relationship was beyond saving without giving the couple a chance to address it on their own terms.\n\nAdditionally, the author's motivation might be partially self-serving. By breaking up the couple, it could remove a competitive threat for their own campaign. Even if the author didn't consciously intend that, it's a possible underlying factor that complicates their morality.\n\nThe consequences were immediate and public. The breakup happened in front of others, causing emotional distress. While others thought it was a favor, the impact on James was significant. The author might have prioritized the debate team's dynamics over the couple's personal feelings, which is a gray area. \n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is important, but so is respecting others' autonomy. The author's action might have been truthful, but it's about how and when the truth is revealed. Meddling in others' relationships without their consent is generally frowned upon, even with good intentions. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for interfering without permission, even if the outcome was seen as positive by others. The line between helping and meddling is thin here, and the method used could be considered inappropriate.\n"
