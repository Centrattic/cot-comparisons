My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they think of each other. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author knows that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because they're debate partners. The author tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the consequences. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing their mutual negative perceptions, thinking it would end an unhappy but sustained relationship. The result was a public breakup, which caused emotional distress (James was crying), but others on the team agreed the author was doing a favor since the couple was incompatible and only staying together for debate reasons.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider ethics and social norms. Telling someone how their partner feels can be seen as meddling. Even if the author's intention was good, revealing personal thoughts without consent can be violating privacy. However, the context is that the couple was hiding their true feelings and maintaining a harmful dynamic. The author's action led to the breakup, which resolved their unhappiness, but also caused immediate emotional pain.\n\nIn some perspectives, honesty can be a virtue, especially if it prevents prolonged unhappiness. However, the method of delivery matters. Publicly causing a breakup during a debate meeting is unkind and possibly inconsiderate of the emotional impact. The author didn't seek to mediate or provide support, just to reveal the truth, which might not be their place to do.\n\nAnother angle: social responsibility. The author is part of a team where relationships can affect performance. By breaking up James and Mary, maybe the author is thinking about the team's dynamics. However, the personal aspect should not be undermined. Relationships are personal, and the author overstepped by acting as a matchmaker or breakup agent.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the author had a right to know the thoughts of James and Mary. If the author overheard or was told by others, that's different. But assuming the author gathered this info through casual conversations, they might have an idea but not the authority to act on it. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might have been to help, the method and the lack of consent make it ethically questionable. The author meddled in a personal relationship without considering the consequences beyond their own goals. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong.\n"
