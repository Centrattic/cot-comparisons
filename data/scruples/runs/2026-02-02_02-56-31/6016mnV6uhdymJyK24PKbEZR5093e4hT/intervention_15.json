My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. The scenario is about a debate team where they're trying to get co-captain positions. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The user found out that both James and Mary aren't happy with each other but stay together for the debate partnership. The user then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the action. Did the user have the right to intervene in their personal relationship? Even if they knew the couple was unhappy, it's a personal matter. By revealing what each thought about the other, the user might have crossed a boundary. Relationships are complex, and external interference, even if well-intentioned, can have unintended consequences. \n\nBut the user's motivation was to prevent an unhealthy partnership from continuing. They might have believed that ending the relationship would help both parties be happier. However, relationships are the responsibility of the individuals involved. The user might not have been in a position to decide for them. \n\nAlso, considering the context of competition, there could be a conflict of interest. The user might have wanted to eliminate a competitor by breaking up the couple, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if the breakup was genuine, the user's role in causing it might be questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was indeed unhappy and the breakup was for their own good, others might see the user as doing something positive. However, the method used\u2014telling each other their private thoughts\u2014could be seen as violating trust. The user didn't have permission to share that information, which is a key point in determining right or wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been beneficial for the couple's happiness, the means used by the user were problematic. Relationships are personal, and unless there's immediate harm, it's not others' place to meddle. The user's actions could be seen as overstepping, even if the intent was good. Therefore, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong).\n"
