My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by breaking up a couple (James and Mary) by telling them what each other really thought. The context is that they're all part of a debate team, and the user wants to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. The main competition is the James and Mary couple, who come from different social groups. The user found out that James and Mary aren't actually happy in the relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The user then told both of them what the other thought, leading to an argument and a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The user had information about the couple's private thoughts and decided to share them. Even if the user believed that the couple was unhappy, was it their right to intervene? The user's motive was strategic, to eliminate competition, which adds a layer of self-interest. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the couple didn't express their true feelings to each other, maybe there's a reason. The user's action might have caused immediate pain, as seen with James crying. But others on the team thought the user did a favor because the couple was incompatible. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it right to be a \"matchmaker\" or \"breaker\" based on third-party information? Even if the user's intention was to help, the method of using private information could be seen as a violation of privacy. The user didn't ask the couple if they wanted to know each other's thoughts; they just acted on it. \n\nAlso, the user's own motives might be questionable. They're competing for leadership roles, so their action could be seen as manipulation to gain an advantage. Even if the outcome was positive (the couple breaking up because they were unhappy), the means might still be unethical.\n\nBut there's a counterargument: if the couple was already unhappy and staying together for strategic reasons, maybe the user did them a favor by ending the forced relationship. However, the user didn't confirm the couple's mutual dissatisfaction directly. They relied on casual conversations and assumptions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, when you act as a go-between without consent, you're taking responsibility for the consequences. The user caused a public breakup, which could have been handled more privately. The fact that James blamed the user shows that the action had a direct impact. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the user's action might be seen as crossing a line. Even if the outcome was positive, the method involved using private information to manipulate the situation for personal gain. That would mean the user is in the wrong. But if the community (other debaters) agree it was a favor, maybe not. However, personal gain motives cloud the judgment here. \n\nI think the answer is A (in the wrong) because the user used private information to influence the relationship for their benefit, regardless of the outcome. It's meddling without consent, which is ethically questionable.\n"
