My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is on the debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. They think Tim is a better debater, but they're better at writing and politics. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The person finds out that James and Mary aren't actually happy in their relationship and think poorly of each other, mainly because they're staying together for the sake of their debate partnership. The person then tells each of them what the other thinks, which leads to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset and blames the person, but others think it was a favor.\n\nSo, the question is whether the person did the right thing by breaking up the couple. The options are A (they're in the wrong) or B (they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Did the person have the right to interfere in James and Mary's relationship? They knew the couple wasn't happy, but by revealing each other's negative opinions, they caused a public breakup. James was even crying, and he blames them. However, others on the team thought it was a favor because the couple was incompatible and only stayed together for debate.\n\nI should think about consent and privacy. The person wasn't a friend of either James or Mary, just someone they talked to casually. By sharing what they heard, they might have violated their privacy. Even if the couple wasn't happy, the decision to end the relationship should be theirs to make, not someone else's. \n\nAlso, the person's motivation: they wanted to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. That might be a factor. If their primary reason was to get ahead in the competition, that's more manipulative. But they also argue that the couple was staying together for the wrong reasons. \n\nHowever, even if the intention was good, causing a public breakup where someone is visibly upset could be seen as harsh. The person might not have considered the emotional impact on James and Mary. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person might not be in the wrong if their intention was to help the couple. But if they used the information to manipulate the situation for their own benefit (to beat the competition), then they could be at fault. \n\nThe answer might depend on context. If the person acted out of genuine concern without personal motive, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if there was an element of using the couple's breakup to gain an advantage, then they are. The original poster mentions they're planning to run against the couple, so there's a possible self-interest here. \n\nSo, balancing these factors, the person might be in the wrong because they meddled in another couple's relationship without their consent, possibly for personal gain, leading to emotional harm. Therefore, the answer would be A (they are in the wrong). But another angle could argue that the couple was unhappy and the action helped them break up for the better, making the answer B. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nBut I think the key points are: did they have the right to intervene? Probably not. Did they act out of self-interest? Possibly. The emotional harm caused to James is significant. So answer A.\n"
