My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary have negative feelings about each other but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup and an argument during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions and intentions. The author's goal was probably to help James and Mary by ending a relationship that was causing them unhappiness because of incompatibility. By breaking them up, the author might be trying to prevent them from being in a bad relationship for the sake of debate. But was it right to do so?\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were doing the right thing by being honest and helping them realize they don't get along. The result was that they broke up, which others agreed was a good thing because they were incompatible. The author's argument is that they were doing a favor by ending a forced relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't ask James and Mary directly for their thoughts or feelings. They went around and told each other what the other thought, which could be seen as meddling. Even if the author's intention was good, the method could be problematic. Relationships are personal, and even if two people are unhappy, it's their choice to end it. The author might have overstepped by not letting them handle it themselves. Also, causing an argument in a public meeting led to James crying, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the debate team. If James and Mary breaking up affects the team dynamics, but the author's main concern was their own competition. Maybe the author had a self-interested motive to eliminate the competition by breaking them up, even if it's framed as helping them. That could be a conflict of interest.\n\nBut the author claims that they were doing it for their well-being, not just to win. However, the line between helping and interfering can be blurry. Even if the outcome was positive (the couple breaking up), the means of using someone else's private thoughts without permission might be unethical. It's about respecting others' autonomy and confidentiality.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might have been to help, the action of revealing private thoughts without consent could be considered wrong. The rightness of the action isn't just about the outcome but also about how it was done. So, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled in a personal relationship without consent, even if it led to a positive result.\n"
