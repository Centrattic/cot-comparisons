My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they did the right thing by breaking up a couple (James and Mary) because they thought their partnership was affecting their debate co-captainship chances. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is on the debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The user found out that James and Mary have a lot of issues in their relationship but stay together because of debate. The user then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the user, but others thought it was a favor because they were unhappy and incompatible.\n\nI need to determine if the user is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key factors here are intent, the method used, and the consequences. The user's motivation was to undermine their competition, which is a bit self-serving. However, the action taken might have been beneficial for James and Mary's well-being, even if it was a harsh way to handle it.\n\nEthically, interfering in a relationship is usually frowned upon unless there's a serious issue like harm. But in this case, the user believed the relationship was keeping them together despite incompatibility. However, the user's primary motive wasn't to help the couple but to advance their own position. That complicates things. While the outcome might have been positive, the intent was manipulative. There's a line between helping someone see the truth and using a backhanded method to get ahead.\n\nAlso, the method of revealing private thoughts without consent is a problem. Even if the user had the right information, sharing it without the couple's consent could be seen as a breach of trust. The user didn't seek to mediate or offer support; instead, they directly caused a confrontation. The emotional impact on James, who was crying, shows that the approach was hurtful, even if the result was a breakup.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user's actions were self-serving and insincere. While the couple might have benefited, the user's role in using them as pawns to eliminate competition makes them at fault. The right approach would have been to let the couple handle their issues themselves or offer support if they were struggling, not to manipulate the situation for personal gain.\n"
