My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. They're on the debate team and their partner is running for co-captains with them. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The user knows they're not happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The user told each of them the bad things the other thought, leading to a breakup in the middle of a meeting.\n\nSo, first, did the user have the right to intervene? They say they did it because the couple was unhappy and only staying together for debate. But relationships are personal, and even if the couple isn't happy, it's their choice whether to stay together or not. The user might have thought they were helping, but did they overstep? \n\nTelling each person what the other thinks is pretty direct. Even if the user heard these opinions from casual talks, sharing them without the couple's consent could be seen as a betrayal. The fact that James was crying and blamed the user shows the emotional impact. The user might have thought others agreed they were doing a favor, but that doesn't mean it's justified. \n\nAlso, the user's motivation might be to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. Even if that's not stated, the timing and context might suggest self-interest. So, even if the outcome was a breakup, the user's role in causing it could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to privacy in their relationships. The user might have acted out of what they believed was the couple's best interest, but without their permission. So, even if the result was positive, the action might be considered wrong because it violated privacy and autonomy. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they meddled in a personal relationship without consent, leading to public embarrassment and emotional distress.\n"
