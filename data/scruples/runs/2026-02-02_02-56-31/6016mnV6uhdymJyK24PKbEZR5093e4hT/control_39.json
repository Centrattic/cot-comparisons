My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other. The situation is set in a high school debate team where the author is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that neither James nor Mary are happy in the relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others agreed it was a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing their mutual discontent. The action led to the breakup, which the author believed was necessary because the relationship was unhealthy and maintained solely for the benefit of their debate partnership. However, the immediate consequence was emotional distress, with James crying and blaming the author. Others supported the action, saying it was a favor.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspects. Was the author justified in interfering? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple was unhappy, the author's role in exposing their private thoughts might be problematic. The author didn't ask for permission or try to mediate; they directly revealed the negative opinions. This could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the outcome was a breakup that both parties might have wanted. However, the author's intent was to help, and the result was the couple parting ways, which might be better in the long run.\n\nBut there's a line between helping and meddling. The author used their position to influence the competition, which could be seen as underhanded. Debate teams often have rivalries, and using personal information to sabotage opponents might be unethical. Even if the breakup wasn't the author's main goal, the timing and method suggest it was done to gain an advantage in the co-captain election. This could be considered unfair manipulation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that the couple wasn't happy and was staying together for the wrong reasons. By revealing the truth, the author might have helped them part ways, which is a positive outcome. However, the method of doing so\u2014telling each other negative opinions without their knowledge\u2014could be seen as a violation of privacy and trust. It's possible that the couple would have broken up on their own without the author's intervention, or they might have addressed their issues differently.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had the right to act as a mediator. Friends or acquaintances sometimes do this, but the author isn't close to either James or Mary. Their role as a debate team member adds another layer, where personal relationships can affect team dynamics. However, using personal information to influence team competitions is questionable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is generally valued, but there's also the importance of respecting relationships and not acting as a \"matchmaker\" or \"breaker\" without consent. The author might not be in the wrong if the intention was purely to help and there was no malicious intent. But the method of revealing private thoughts without the couple's consent could be problematic, regardless of the outcome.\n\nConsidering the outcome, James was upset and blamed the author. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the immediate emotional harm caused by the breakup is significant. The author might have prioritized their own goals (winning the co-captain election) over the couple's well-being, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nAlternatively, if the author truly believed they were doing the right thing and the breakup was inevitable, then maybe it's a positive outcome. But the ethical gray area lies in the method and the lack of consent. Without knowing the full context of the couple's situation, it's hard to say definitively. However, the act of revealing private thoughts without permission is generally considered a breach of trust, which would make the author at fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions were well-intentioned but ethically questionable due to the lack of consent and potential manipulation for personal gain. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
