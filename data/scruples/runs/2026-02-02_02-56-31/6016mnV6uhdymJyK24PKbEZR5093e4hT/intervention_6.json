My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The scenario is about them breaking up a couple by telling each what the other thinks. The main question is whether that was the right thing to do.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The person knows from talking to both that they're not happy in the relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The person then tells each of them what the other thinks, which leads to an argument and a breakup during a debate meeting. James is upset and blames the person, but others think it was a favor.\n\nSo, the key points are: the couple's relationship is affected by their debate partnership, they're incompatible, and the person acted as a mediator by revealing their mutual negative thoughts. The consequences were immediate breakup, with mixed reactions.\n\nNow, considering ethics. Did the person have the right to intervene? They claim it was to help the couple, but relationships are private. Even if the person had good intentions, did they overstep by sharing personal opinions without consent? Also, the context of competition might have influenced their actions. If the couple's breakup affects the debate team dynamics, maybe the person had a motive, but the main issue is the act of revealing private information.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the couple's issues were their own to resolve. By acting as a go-between, the person might have caused harm, even if it was well-intentioned. Relationships aren't the responsibility of others to fix unless invited to help. The person didn't ask for permission to mediate, so it's possible they crossed a boundary.\n\nHowever, the outcome was positive in that the couple was unhappy and broke up. But the method of confrontation in a public setting (during a meeting) might have exacerbated the situation. Even if the couple was incompatible, the person's role as an external party raises questions about their right to intervene so directly.\n\nSo, considering all factors: intent was to help, but the action involved sharing private information without consent, leading to public conflict. The person might be in the wrong because they overstepped their role as a mediator without being asked, and their actions led to immediate and possibly harsh consequences.\n"
