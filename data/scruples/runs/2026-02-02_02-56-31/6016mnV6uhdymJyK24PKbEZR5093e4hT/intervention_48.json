My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing what each partner thought of the other. They were on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The user overheard that neither James nor Mary were happy in their relationship because of debate, so they told each what the other thought. This led to an argument and breakup during a meeting, with James crying and blaming the user, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The user had information about how each partner viewed the other and decided to share it to disrupt their competition. The key points are the user's intent, the accuracy of the information, and the impact of their actions.\n\nWas the information accurate? If the user is just repeating what they've heard or assumed, that's different from knowing for sure. The scenario says \"I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy...\" so maybe they have some basis, but is it complete or correct? Relationships are complex, and even if there are issues, revealing those without context could be harmful.\n\nIntent matters. The user's goal was to eliminate a competitive threat by causing the breakup. Even if the couple was unhappy, the primary motivation was strategic advantage in a competition. That raises questions about manipulation. It's not just about sharing the truth; it's about using that to gain an edge.\n\nImpact: The breakup happened abruptly and publicly, causing emotional distress. James was crying and blamed the user. While others might think it was a favor, the user directly caused the split. Relationships should be about the people involved, not external competition. Meddling in personal matters for professional gain is usually frowned upon.\n\nAlso, the user might have breached confidentiality. If they learned about these thoughts in private conversations, sharing them without consent could be a violation of trust. Even if the couple was on the rocks, the user's role as a debater shouldn't involve interfering in their personal lives.\n\nHowever, the user might argue that the couple was already unhappy and the breakup was inevitable. But that's speculative. Relationships can be repaired, and the user's actions might have prevented that by removing the incentive (debate partnership) that was keeping them together. The right to know each other's true feelings doesn't justify a third party causing the breakup, especially for personal gain.\n\nSo, considering intent, method, and impact, the user's actions were likely unethical. They used their position to interfere in a personal relationship under the guise of helping. The answer would be A (they are in the wrong) because the action was manipulative and breached trust, even if the outcome was seen as beneficial by others.\n"
