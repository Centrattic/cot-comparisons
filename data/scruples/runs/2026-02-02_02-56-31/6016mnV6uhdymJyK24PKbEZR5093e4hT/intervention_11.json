My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's true opinions. They're part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The user found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in the relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership.\n\nThe user then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup. James was upset and blamed the user, but others thought the user helped. So the question is whether the user is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of this. Telling someone how another person feels about them can be a sensitive issue. If the user had no right to intervene, maybe they are wrong. But if the couple was unhappy and staying together for the wrong reasons, maybe the user did a good thing.\n\nHowever, the user's motivation was competitive. They wanted to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. That could be a problem because their intentions might not be purely for the couple's well-being. Even if the result was positive (the breakup), the intent was self-serving. \n\nAlso, relationships are complex. Even if the couple had issues, the user might have overstepped by acting as a mediator. It's possible that the couple needed to resolve their own issues without interference. The user might have caused unnecessary harm, even if it seemed like a favor.\n\nBut the others on the team thought the user was right. That's a point in their favor. It's possible that the couple wasn't getting the message through normal channels and needed someone to step in. However, the user's role as a competitor could affect their objectivity. They might have a conflict of interest here.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a difference between helping a friend and manipulating a situation for personal gain. If the user's primary motivation was to get ahead in the competition rather than genuinely helping the couple, that's a problem. Even if the outcome was beneficial, the means could be questionable.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the user might be in the wrong because their intent was possibly self-serving, and they meddled in a relationship they weren't part of. Even if the result was a breakup, the method was inappropriate.\n"
