My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them their true thoughts. The scenario is in a high school debate team context.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is part of a debate team and their partner is also their friend. They're competing against a couple (James and Mary) who are partners in debate but from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of the debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting, which upset James and others had mixed reactions. Some agreed it was a favor, others like James blamed the author.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author acted out of what they thought was a good intention\u2014helping the couple by ending an unhappy relationship. However, they did so by revealing private thoughts without consent. The problem is that even if the relationship was toxic, the means of breaking it up involved meddling without the couple's permission. The author didn't consult James or Mary before exposing their private feelings. Even though the outcome might have been beneficial, the method was intrusive. Relationships are personal, and while the author might have had good intentions, crossing the line into actively causing a breakup by spreading information can be seen as a violation of trust and privacy. \n\nAlso, from a social standpoint, intervening in someone's personal life without their consent can be considered meddling. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the couple had the right to make their own decisions. The author's action might have caused immediate emotional distress, as seen with James crying. While the intention was to help, the execution was problematic. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the couple's autonomy to handle their relationship issues themselves, even if the outcome seemed positive.\n"
