  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they did something wrong by breaking up a couple to benefit their own debate team's chances. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is part of a debate team and wants to become co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another team, James and Mary, who are a couple but come from different social groups. The user believes that James and Mary's relationship is unhappy and that they're staying together solely because of their debate partnership. The user then told both James and Mary what the other thought about them, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. James blamed the user, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nNow, the key points here are the user's intent and the consequences. The user's motivation was to improve their own team's position by disrupting the competition. By revealing each other's negative opinions, they caused the breakup. The ethical issue here is whether it's right to interfere in someone else's personal relationship for personal gain.\n\nOn one hand, the user might argue that they were doing a good deed by helping the couple realize their incompatibility, even if it was for strategic reasons. But the problem is that the user's primary intent was to weaken the competition. This complicates the moral justification because the action was driven by self-interest rather than genuine concern for the couple's well-being. Even if the outcome was positive for the couple, the method was manipulative.\n\nAlso, relationships are personal, and even if the couple was unhappy, the user didn't have the right to meddle in that. It's possible that the couple might have decided to stay together despite their issues, which is their choice. By causing a public breakup, the user overstepped and acted recklessly with other people's emotions.\n\nJames's reaction, including crying and blaming the user, indicates the emotional harm caused. While others might agree the user did a favor, that doesn't absolve them of responsibility. The user's actions led to a public scene and emotional distress, which is significant.\n\nSo, weighing the intent (selfish) and the consequences (harmful), it seems the user acted wrongly. The answer would be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
