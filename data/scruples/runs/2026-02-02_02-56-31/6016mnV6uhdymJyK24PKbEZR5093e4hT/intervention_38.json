My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're at fault for breaking up a couple by telling each other their true thoughts. Here's the situation: they're on a debate team, and their partner (Tim) is running for co-captains with them. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The user found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but are staying together for debate reasons. The user told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting, with James crying and blaming the user. Others thought the user did a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Was it right to interfere in their relationship? The user's intention was to help them be honest, but relationships are personal. Even if the couple was unhappy, the user didn't have the right to meddle. They might have thought they were doing the right thing, but relationships aren't a problem others can solve. The user's actions caused public embarrassment and emotional distress. Even if the couple was incompatible, it's not the user's place to act as a matchmaker or breakup agent. There could be consequences beyond just the breakup, like affecting the debate team's dynamics. Also, the user's motives might be partly strategic to eliminate competition, which adds another layer of ethical concern. So, even if the outcome seemed positive, the action of intervening without consent was wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
