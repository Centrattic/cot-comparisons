My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other really thinks. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, the context is a high school debate team. The user is planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The user knows that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The user then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James blames the user, but others think it was a favor because they were incompatible and unhappy.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user acted on the belief that the couple was unhappy and incompatible, and by revealing each other's true thoughts, they caused a breakup. Now, the question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider ethical aspects. Was the user justified in revealing private thoughts? Even if the couple wasn't happy, does the user have the right to meddle in their personal relationships? Also, the user's motivation was to eliminate competition, so there might be a self-serving motive here. Even if others agreed it was a favor, does that absolve the user of responsibility?\n\nAnother angle is the concept of honesty versus privacy. While the user might have thought they were being honest, they crossed a boundary by revealing others' private opinions without consent. Relationships are complex, and even if the couple was unhappy, it's not up to others to decide their fate. The emotional impact on James, who was crying, suggests that the action had serious consequences.\n\nAlso, the social dynamics of the debate team play a role. The user's action might have been seen as helpful because it removed a potential joint ticket from the competition, but is that a valid reason to interfere in a personal relationship? Manipulating others for personal gain, even if it's for a position, can be ethically questionable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user took it upon themselves to act as a mediator without being asked. Even if the couple was unhappy, they might have wanted to handle it themselves. The user's intervention could be seen as overstepping, regardless of the outcome.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the user's actions were intrusive and possibly self-motivated. Even if the result seemed positive for the team, the method of achieving it was ethically problematic. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
