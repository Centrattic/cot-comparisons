My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's negative opinions. They're on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The user found out that both James and Mary aren't happy with each other but stay together because of their debate partnership. The user then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nHmm, so the user's reasoning is that the couple was incompatible and staying together only for debate, causing unhappiness. They thought they were doing a favor. But James blamed them, while others agreed. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Intervening in someone else's relationship is tricky. Even if the user had good intentions, did they have the right to meddle? Relationships are personal, and sharing someone's private thoughts without consent can be a breach of trust. But the user might argue that the couple wasn't happy and it was for their own good.\n\nAlso, the context is a competitive environment (debate team), so maybe there's an element of wanting to eliminate competition. However, the user mentions they're not friends with James or Mary, just casual talk. Did they get the information accurately? What if the user misinterpreted or exaggerated the thoughts? That could lead to unnecessary harm.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was indeed unhappy and the relationship was causing them distress, maybe the user did help them realize the incompatibility. But relationships are complex, and even if both have issues, breaking up suddenly might have consequences beyond what the user anticipated, like emotional distress as seen with James crying.\n\nAnother angle: the user's role in the debate team. As a debater, they might be used to strategic thinking, but personal relationships aren't a debate topic. The line between strategy and personal ethics is blurred here. The user might have thought it's in the team's interest for the co-captains to be a stable partnership, but forcing a breakup could backfire if the team dynamics suffer.\n\nConsidering societal norms, it's generally advised not to interfere in others' relationships unless there's a clear harm (like abuse). In this case, the harm is more about personal happiness. The user's actions might be seen as overstepping, even if well-intentioned. The fact that others agreed complicates things, but public opinion doesn't necessarily make an action right.\n\nAlso, the user's motivation could be questioned. Were they genuinely concerned about the couple's happiness, or was there a competitive edge to weaken the opposing team? The user mentions anticipating competition from James and Mary, so there might be a conflict of interest here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been positive (the couple breaking up because they were unhappy), the method of intervention\u2014without consent\u2014could be considered wrong. The user didn't have the right to meddle, even with good intentions. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong), but there are nuances. However, since the user's action led to the couple's own decision to break up, maybe it's a gray area. But ethically, it's still meddling, so likely answer A.\n"
