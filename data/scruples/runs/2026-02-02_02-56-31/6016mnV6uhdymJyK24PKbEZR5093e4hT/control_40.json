My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author noticed that James and Mary weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author did the right thing by helping them part ways.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's motivation, the method used, and the consequences. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing their mutual dissatisfaction, thinking it would lead to a breakup that both would be better off. However, breaking up in the middle of a meeting caused emotional distress, with James crying. Others believed the author was doing a favor, but James is upset.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Telling someone personal thoughts about their partner without their consent is generally an invasion of privacy. Even if the author thought it was for their benefit, sharing such information can be seen as meddling in others' relationships. Relationships are complex, and while the couple might have been unhappy, the decision to break up should ideally be theirs to make. The author took it upon themselves to act as a mediator, which could be seen as overstepping. However, the outcome was positive in that the couple was incompatible, and the author might have prevented ongoing unhappiness.\n\nBut the method was direct and public, leading to emotional harm. Even with good intentions, the way it was handled might be problematic. People have the right to privacy and autonomy in their relationships. The author didn't ask if they wanted to know each other's thoughts, just revealed them. So, while the intention was good, the action was intrusive and could be considered wrong because it violated trust and privacy.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong, because they meddled without consent and caused immediate emotional harm, even if the long-term outcome was positive.\n"
