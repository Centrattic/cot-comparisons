My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other really thinks. So, the situation is that they're in a debate team, and they're planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The person found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The person then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. Did the person have a right to intervene? Well, they claim they were doing it to help them realize their incompatibility. But relationships are personal, and even if the couple was keeping together for the sake of debate, others might not have the right to meddle. The person might be overstepping by acting as a mediator without being asked. \n\nAlso, the breakup happened in the middle of a meeting, causing emotional distress, like James crying. Even if the couple was unhappy, the way the person went about it could be seen as harsh. They could have approached them privately instead of making a public scene. \n\nOn the other hand, the person's intention was to help them be honest and maybe lead to a better outcome, like being happier. The others on the team agreed it was a favor because the couple was incompatible. But does that justify the method? \n\nThere's also the aspect of privacy. The person might have overheard or been told something private and shared it without consent. Even if the information was true, sharing it without the couple's permission could be a breach of trust. \n\nAnother angle is the motive. The person is trying to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. Is their primary intent to help the couple, or is there an ulterior motive for their own ambitions? If the person's actions are partly self-serving, that could reflect poorly on their intentions. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The couple might have needed to confront their issues themselves. By telling them what they thought of each other, the person might have prevented them from resolving the issues on their own terms. \n\nSo, even if the outcome was a breakup that some see as positive, the method and the intent might still make the person in the wrong. They didn't ask for permission, acted in a public setting, and possibly used the information to gain an advantage. Therefore, the answer might be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
