  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're at fault for breaking up a couple by telling them what they think of each other. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The user noticed that the couple isn't happy in their relationship but stays together because of their debate partnership. The user then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James blames the user, but others think they did a favor.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the intention and the method. The user's intention was to help the couple by ending a harmful relationship. But the method involved revealing private thoughts they might have shared in confidence. Even if the user overheard or assumed correctly what each thought of the other, sharing that without consent could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a line between helping someone and violating their privacy. The user might have thought they were doing the right thing, but without permission, they crossed into territory where they shouldn't have. Relationships are complex, and even if people are unhappy, it's not up to others to decide to end them. The user's actions caused public embarrassment and emotional distress, which is a significant factor.\n\nAlso, the user's position on the debate team might have given them a sense of authority or justification, thinking that since the relationship affects their debate performance, it's fair to intervene. However, personal relationships and professional settings should probably be kept separate. The user's interference led to a public breakup, which might be seen as harsh and unnecessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's argument is that the couple was incompatible and staying together for the wrong reasons. But that's a judgment call. They might not have considered that the couple might have wanted to work things out eventually or that the breakup could have been handled privately. The user's role in causing the breakup directly, especially in front of others, could be seen as overstepping.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the outcome (the breakup) was seen as beneficial by others, the method of revealing private thoughts without consent is likely where the user is at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A, meaning they are in the wrong.\n"
