My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a debate team member who broke up a couple by telling each what the other thought. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The writer is part of a debate team, and their partner Tim is better at debate but they are better at writing and politics. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The writer found out that James and Mary don't like each other much but stayed together for debate. So the writer told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup and an argument. James is upset, but others think the writer was right to do it.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are intent and consequences. The author's intent was to stop the couple from staying together because they were unhappy but stuck due to their debate partnership. The consequence was the breakup, which caused emotional distress (James crying) but also resolved a forced relationship.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it right to interfere? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple is unhappy, it's their choice. The author might have thought they were being helpful, but did they have the right to share private information? Telling each person what the other thinks could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the information was true, spreading it without consent can be harmful. The fact that James blamed the author and was crying shows the emotional impact.\n\nOn the other hand, others agree it was a favor, suggesting that the couple's situation was toxic or inauthentic because they were together for strategic reasons. The author might believe their action led to a more honest outcome. However, the method used\u2014directly telling each other negative thoughts\u2014might not have been the best approach. Maybe approaching them separately to mediate or not getting involved at all would have been better.\n\nLegally, it's not about legal rights but ethics. Ethically, the author's actions caused harm even if the intention was good. The problem is that the author took it upon themselves to mediate a personal relationship, which isn't their role. Even if the outcome was positive (the breakup), the means of achieving it might be questionable. Relationships should be handled by the people involved, not third parties inserting their opinions, especially without consent.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be competitive\u2014wanting to eliminate competition by breaking up the rival couple. There's an underlying self-interest here, which complicates the moral judgment. If the author's primary reason was to help James and Mary, but there's also a competitive angle, that could make their actions more self-serving than altruistic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been seen as positive by others, the act of sharing personal, negative feedback without consent could be considered wrong, especially if it led to emotional harm. The author overstepped by not respecting the couple's autonomy and possibly acting out of self-interest. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
