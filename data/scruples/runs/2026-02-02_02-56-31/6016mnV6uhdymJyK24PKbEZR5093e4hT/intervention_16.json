My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's true thoughts. The scenario involves high school debate team politics.\n\nFirst, the user is part of a debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The user knows that the couple isn't happy but staying together for the debate partnership. The user told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset, but others think the user helped.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intent and consequences. The user's intention was to help by revealing the true feelings, leading to the breakup. The couple was already incompatible and staying together for the partnership. The action caused immediate conflict but might have prevented a long-term unhappy relationship.\n\nBut did the user have the right to intervene? They weren't close friends to either, just casual acquaintances. Telling each other's private thoughts without permission could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the couple was unhappy, the user might have overstepped. The fact that James was crying and blamed the user suggests emotional harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's argument is that they were doing a favor, as others agreed. But is it right to act as a mediator without being asked? Maybe the couple should have handled it themselves. The user's action was direct and public, leading to an argument in front of others. That could be seen as harsh, even if the outcome was positive.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the user might be in the wrong because they meddled in a personal relationship without consent, even with good intentions. The method was abrupt and public, which could be hurtful. The right to privacy and autonomy in relationships is important. Even if the couple was unhappy, the user's intervention was a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
