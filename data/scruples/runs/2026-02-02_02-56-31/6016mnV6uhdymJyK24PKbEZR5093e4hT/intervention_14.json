  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the scenario is in the wrong here. So, the user is part of a debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The user found out that James and Mary aren't happy with each other but are staying together because they need to work as a team for debate. The user then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The user had information about the couple's private thoughts and feelings. By revealing that information, they caused a public breakup. The key question is whether it was right to act as a \"matchmaker\" by breaking up their relationship, even if they were unhappy.\n\nOn one hand, the user might argue that they were helping James and Mary by ending a relationship that was making them unhappy. The other team members seemed to agree with this, saying it was a favor. On the other hand, James was upset and blamed the user, which suggests that there's a breach of trust or privacy here. The user didn't ask for permission or consider the potential consequences beyond their immediate goal of winning the election.\n\nAnother angle is the motive. The user's primary motivation might be to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. Even if the user thought they were helping, if part of their intention was to weaken the other team's chances, that could be seen as manipulative. Also, relationships are personal, and even if the couple was incompatible, the user's role in exposing their private thoughts could be seen as interfering in something that isn't their business.\n\nThere's also the aspect of how the information was revealed. Doing it in the middle of a debate meeting might have been a public and stressful way to handle a private issue. Even if the information was true, the method and timing could be problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together: While the user's intention might have been to help, the action taken was meddling in a personal relationship, which can be seen as crossing a boundary. The fact that their main competition was this couple might also imply a conflict of interest. Even if the outcome was positive (both people being happier), the means of getting there could be questionable. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for acting without considering the personal implications and using the information to their advantage in a competitive context.\n"
