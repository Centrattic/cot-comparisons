My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is part of a debate team and told their partner's competition that the other person in the relationship thought poorly of them. The key here is that the couple, James and Mary, were in a relationship but not actually happy with each other. The user found out that James thinks Mary is too idealistic and anti-social, while Mary sees James as a big mouth with a small brain. The user then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The user's goal was probably to help the couple break up because they were unhappy and just staying together for the sake of their debate partnership. Others on the team agreed they were incompatible, so maybe the user felt the breakup would be beneficial in the long run.\n\nBut, did the user have the right to meddle in their relationship? Even if the couple was unhappy, the user isn't in a position to act as a mediator or to force a decision. Relationships are personal, and sharing private thoughts between partners could be seen as a breach of trust. The user might have thought they were doing the right thing by being honest, but without the couple's consent, that could come off as manipulative.\n\nAlso, the context is a high school debate team. The user is trying to secure co-captain positions, and the competition is this couple. By breaking them up, the user might have removed their main rivals, which could look like self-serving behavior. Even if others agreed they were incompatible, the user's motivation might not be purely altruistic.\n\nSo, while the outcome might have been a breakup that others saw as positive, the method used by the user is questionable. They didn't get the couple's permission to share their private thoughts, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy and possibly causing unnecessary harm. Even if they were unhappy, the couple should have the opportunity to address their issues themselves. The user might have overstepped by taking it upon themselves to end the relationship based on their own interpretation of the situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user's actions could be considered wrong because they interfered in a personal relationship without consent, even if the intention was to help. The situation might have been better handled by allowing the couple to confront each other directly if they wanted to. The user's role as a debate team member doesn't necessarily give them the right to meddle in personal matters. So, the answer might be A, as the user could be seen as in the wrong.\n"
