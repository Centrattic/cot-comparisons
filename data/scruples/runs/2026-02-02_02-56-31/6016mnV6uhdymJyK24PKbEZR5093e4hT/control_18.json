My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's true thoughts. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is on the debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. They mention that their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author learned that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author acted out of a belief that the couple was incompatible and their relationship was causing unhappiness. They wanted to help them realize the truth and maybe improve their chances in the competition. But James blamed the author, while others agreed it was a favor.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Intentionally revealing personal thoughts without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author thought they were helping, they didn't ask the couple for permission to share such sensitive information. The breakup was public and caused emotional distress, which the author might be responsible for.\n\nHowever, the author's motivation was to help them break up because they were unhappy. The question is whether the means justified the ends. In relationships, honesty is important, but the method of delivery matters. The author didn't approach James and Mary to discuss privately. Instead, they revealed the information in a meeting, leading to a public argument and breakup. That's a significant intrusion into their personal lives.\n\nAlso, considering the context of competition, there's an element of self-interest. The author wants to eliminate competition, so they might have a conflict of interest in determining whether the couple is truly incompatible. Their judgment could be biased because they benefit from the breakup.\n\nSo, while the intention might have been good, the action was invasive and caused harm. The author didn't have the right to disclose personal thoughts, and the public manner of doing so was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
