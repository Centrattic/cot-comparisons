My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person (the one asking if they're in the wrong) is at fault here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person is part of a debate team. They and their partner are planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The key issue is that the person found out that James and Mary don't really like each other much but stayed together because their debate partnership is important. The person then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting. James blames them, but others think they did the right thing.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Did the person have the right to intervene in this relationship? The main argument is that James and Mary were unhappy but stayed together for their debate partnership. The person's motivation was to help them by ending the unhappy relationship. But was it their place to do so?\n\nOn one hand, the person might believe they were helping by giving the couple a chance to address their issues. On the other hand, relationships are personal, and the person didn't have the couple's consent to act as a mediator or to reveal private thoughts. Even if the couple was unhappy, the method of intervention was public and caused emotional distress, especially with James crying. \n\nAlso, the person's own motives could be questioned. They might have been trying to eliminate competition for the co-captain position, which could be a conflict of interest. However, the person claims they weren't friends with either and just wanted to help.\n\nAnother angle: relationships are complex. Even if the couple had mutual criticisms, the person's intervention led to a breakup, but relationships involve more than just mutual dislike. The breakup could have been avoided if the couple addressed their issues themselves. The person's action might be seen as overstepping, as they didn't consider if the couple wanted to work things out.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is important, but how and when it's delivered matters. The person didn't handle it privately or suggest a mediated discussion, which could have been a more respectful approach. Publicly causing a breakup like this might be seen as bullying or manipulation, especially in a competitive environment.\n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? They had good intentions but acted in a way that violated the couple's privacy and autonomy. Even if others agreed with the outcome, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be that they are at fault (A).\n"
