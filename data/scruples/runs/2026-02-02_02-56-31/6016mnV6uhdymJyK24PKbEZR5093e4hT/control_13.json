My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other. The scenario is from a debate team where the author is trying to set up a co-captain run with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author noticed that the two were unhappy in their relationship but stayed together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are the author's intention and the consequences. The author's motivation was to help James and Mary by revealing their incompatibility, so they could break up and perhaps the author's team would have a better chance against them. However, the author didn't directly ask either of them for permission or have a conversation to understand the deeper reasons behind their feelings. They just passed along what they thought each person thought about the other.\n\nThe ethical question here is about honesty and manipulation. The author might have believed that James and Mary needed to know the truth to make an informed decision. However, the act of revealing private thoughts without consent could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author's intention was good, using their position or information to influence a romantic relationship might be crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the author might have benefited from this breakup, as James and Mary being a team could have been a stronger competitor. This introduces the possibility of ulterior motives. The author's actions might have been self-serving under the guise of helping others. \n\nIn terms of consequences, James was upset and blamed the author, while others on the team agreed with the author's action. But emotions and relationships are complex. The breakup happened publicly, which could have added to the humiliation for James. \n\nEthically, people have the right to privacy regarding their relationships. Even if the author thought they were helping, the method involved meddling in a personal matter without the individuals' consent. The author might have assumed they knew what was best for James and Mary, but relationships are personal and require mutual decisions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the outcome seemed beneficial, the means of achieving it were questionable. The author didn't have the right to disclose others' private thoughts, especially if it was done to gain a competitive advantage. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
