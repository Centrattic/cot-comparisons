My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they did something wrong by breaking up a couple (James and Mary) to help their own chances in an election for debate team co-captains. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is part of a debate team and is running for co-captain with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The user found out that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The user then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting, with James crying and blaming them. Others on the team thought the user was doing a favor.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is at fault. The ethical dilemma here involves honesty and meddling in others' relationships for personal gain. On one hand, the user might believe they were helping James and Mary by revealing the truth and ending an unhappy relationship. On the other hand, they might have overstepped by intentionally causing a public breakup to undermine their competition.\n\nFactors to consider: Was the user justified in thinking their actions were for the couple's benefit? Did they have the right to intervene in their personal relationship? Could there have been a more discreet or respectful way to handle it? Also, the user's motive was partly self-serving to beat the competition, which complicates things. Even if the outcome was positive for the couple, the method might be questionable. Publicly causing a breakup could be seen as a violation of privacy and trust. \n\nOthers on the team agreed it was a favor, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's right. The user might have crossed a line by using their knowledge to manipulate the situation for their advantage. The emotional impact on James, who was crying, suggests that the method was harsh. Ethically, even if the intention had good outcomes, the means (public confrontation, using personal information) might make the user at fault. So, leaning towards A (they are in the wrong) because they meddled in a personal relationship for strategic reasons, causing public embarrassment and emotional distress, despite possible good intentions.\n"
