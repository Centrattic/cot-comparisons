My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author breaking up a couple, James and Mary, by telling them what each other really thought. The author is part of a debate team and they're trying to form co-captains. Their main competition is this couple, who are from different social groups. The author found out that the couple isn't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of the debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup and an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is acting as a mediator here, but did they have the right to do so? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple isn't happy, it's usually up to them to decide. The author might have thought they were helping because the couple might not be compatible, but by revealing the negative thoughts, they caused immediate emotional harm, like James crying. \n\nBut then again, other people on the team agreed that the author was doing them a favor. The couple was unhappy, and staying together for the partnership might have been a mistake. However, the author didn't get their permission to intervene. Relationships are private, and even if there's a mutual benefit to breaking up, the author stepping in without being asked could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the author's motive is questionable. They want to run for co-captains with their partner, and their main competition is this couple. So maybe there's a conflict of interest. Even if the author genuinely wanted to help, the timing and context suggest that their actions benefited their own ambitions. That could be a problem because it's using someone else's personal issues to gain an advantage.\n\nBut then, the outcome was that the couple broke up, which they might not have done otherwise. If they were truly unhappy, maybe the author did them a favor. However, the method of intervention was direct and caused public embarrassment and emotional distress. \n\nSo, the key points are: right to privacy, motive, and the method used. The author didn't ask for permission, acted on their own to affect a situation that's not their place, and did so for personal gain. Even if the result was positive, the means were questionable. \n\nBut others on the team saw it as a favor, which suggests that maybe the author's action was seen as a positive outcome. Still, the act of revealing someone's private thoughts without consent is a breach of trust. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author is responsible for the consequences. Even if the couple was incompatible, the author shouldn't have meddled. The answer might depend on cultural or social norms, but generally, it's not acceptable to interfere in others' relationships without their consent. \n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong because they crossed a boundary by revealing private information and acted out of self-interest. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
