My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, who's on the debate team, is planning to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author noticed that neither James nor Mary was happy in the relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author did a favor.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted on information they had from casual conversations, intending to help James and Mary by revealing their mutual dislike. The result was a breakup that made everyone else agree they were incompatible but stayed together for debate. However, James was hurt and cried, feeling the author was responsible.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about intent versus consequence. The author's intent was to help the couple by ending a bad relationship that was affecting their well-being. However, the method was direct\u2014telling them each other's thoughts without their consent. Even if the outcome was positive (breaking up a toxic relationship), the means involved betrayal of trust with both James and Mary. \n\nAlso, the author might have overstepped by acting as a mediator without being asked. Relationships are personal, and inserting oneself into another's private matter can be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the fact that James blamed the author suggests that the action had negative personal consequences, despite the perceived benefit.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motive was partly strategic, as breaking up the competition could help their own campaign. But the question is whether that's a valid consideration. The author claims the main reason was concern for James and Mary's happiness, but the strategic angle might have influenced their decision, complicating their moral stance.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is a virtue, but so is respecting others' privacy and consent. The author didn't ask for permission to relay the information. They took it upon themselves, which could be seen as interfering without justification. Even if the result was positive, the action might still be considered wrong because it wasn't their role to act as a matchmaker or breakup agent.\n\nSo, even though the outcome might have been for the best, the author's actions were intrusive and possibly self-serving. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A). But some might argue that the author did a good thing. However, the method and the lack of consent are critical factors here. The answer likely leans towards A being correct.\n"
