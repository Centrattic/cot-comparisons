  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by breaking up a couple, James and Mary, by telling each what the other thought. The context is that they're all in debate team, and the user wants to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, but they're from different social groups. The user knew that the couple wasn't happy but stayed together for debate. By revealing each other's negative thoughts, they caused a breakup, leading to James crying but others agreeing it was a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The user had information about each other's negative perceptions and used it to end the relationship. Was it their right to do so? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple wasn't happy, the user's role as an outsider might not justify interfering. Even if others agreed it was a favor, does that make it right?\n\nThen, the user's motive: they wanted to eliminate competition by breaking up the couple. That seems self-serving. Even if they believed the couple was unhappy, using that knowledge strategically to gain an advantage raises questions about their intentions. It\u2019s not just about the truth but about the intent behind sharing it. The user might argue it was a kindness, but the method was invasive and possibly manipulative.\n\nAlso, the consequence: James was upset, which shows the emotional impact. Even if the relationship was toxic, the sudden public breakup in a meeting might have been harsh and unnecessary. The user didn't seek consent from either party before sharing such sensitive information.\n\nAdditionally, the debate team context: partnerships are crucial here. Breaking up a team could affect their performance and the dynamics of the team. The user's action might have disrupted the team without considering the broader implications beyond their own ambitions.\n\nSo, while others might agree the couple wasn't compatible, the user's role in exposing the truth for strategic reasons complicates the morality. There's a difference between facilitating a breakup and actively causing it by revealing private thoughts. The user might not be legally liable, but ethically, they crossed a line by using personal information to manipulate the situation for their benefit. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because of the calculated intent and the method used, despite the outcome being seen as a favor by others. However, some might argue it was a necessary intervention. But given the context of using the information to undermine competition, it's more likely they're in the wrong.\n"
