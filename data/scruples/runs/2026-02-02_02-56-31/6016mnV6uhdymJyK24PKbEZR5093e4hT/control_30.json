My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another team, James and Mary, who are a couple. The author found out that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of the debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications of the author's actions. Did they have a right to intervene? Well, the author's motivation was to help James and Mary by ending a relationship that was inauthentic and causing unhappiness. But relationships are private, and sharing someone's thoughts without consent could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's intention might be good\u2014they wanted the couple to be honest and possibly break up so they could find better partners. However, the method used was to spread information that could harm their relationship. Even if the information was true, the author didn't ask for permission to share it. That's a key point. People have the right to keep their thoughts private, even negative ones about their partners.\n\nAlso, the impact was significant. James was crying and blamed the author. Even though others on the debate team agreed that the author did a favor, the emotional distress caused can't be ignored. The author might have crossed a line by acting as a mediator without being asked to. They could have encouraged the couple to talk to each other instead of stepping in directly.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the debate team. The author's competition with James and Mary might have influenced their decision. Maybe they wanted to weaken the competition, but that's a bit of a stretch. The story says the author isn't friends with either, so it's hard to see a personal gain motive, but the competition aspect exists.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the principle of autonomy is important. People have the right to make their own decisions, even if those decisions are unwise. By revealing the thoughts, the author took away that autonomy, making the decision for them. The couple might have stayed together if they had addressed their issues directly, or maybe they would have broken up anyway. The author's action forced an outcome without their consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were preventing a harmful situation where the couple was staying together out of obligation rather than genuine affection. But even in that case, the appropriate action would be to advise both parties to communicate with each other, not to act as a go-between and share private thoughts.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author likely overstepped their boundaries. They had no right to disclose the couple's private thoughts, even if the intention was to help. The result was a breakup that the couple might not have chosen if they had handled the situation themselves. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
