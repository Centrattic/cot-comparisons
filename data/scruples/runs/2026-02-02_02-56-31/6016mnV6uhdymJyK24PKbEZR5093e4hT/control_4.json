My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the scenario is that the author, who's on the debate team, is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out through casual conversations that James and Mary don't really like each other much\u2014Mary thinks James is a \"big mouth, small brain,\" and James thinks Mary is too idealistic and boring. So, the author tells each of them what the other thinks, which leads to them breaking up in the middle of a meeting.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA). The options are A for yes, B for no. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation: they want to win the co-captain election. Their main competition is this couple, and they think that if James and Mary are together, they can get votes from both their social groups. The author might have felt that breaking them up would remove that competition. But the author claims it's not just about that; they say they were doing it because the couple was unhappy and staying together just for debate.\n\nThe key points here are intent and action. Did the author cross a line by revealing what each thought of the other? The author didn't overhear or eavesdrop; they had casual conversations with both. But even if they had permission to know, sharing that information could be problematic. The question is whether the author had the right to intervene in their relationship, even if they thought it was for their own good.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, relationships are between two people. Even if both parties are unhappy, it's not necessarily someone else's place to meddle unless there's a direct harm to others. The author's action led to a public breakup, which is invasive. Even if the couple was already unhappy, the method of intervention might be seen as crossing a boundary. The author might have acted out of self-interest (to reduce competition) but justified it as helping them. However, the couple didn't ask for the author's help, and the result was emotional harm, with James crying.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was genuinely incompatible and unhappy, maybe the author was doing them a favor. But the author's primary motive might have been to eliminate competition, which complicates things. The other people on the team agreed it was a favor, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. Peer approval doesn't equate to ethical correctness.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action was meddling in a relationship without consent, even if the outcome was the couple breaking up. The fact that they did it to get an advantage in the election suggests ulterior motives. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't have the right to expose each other's criticisms and caused direct emotional distress. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
