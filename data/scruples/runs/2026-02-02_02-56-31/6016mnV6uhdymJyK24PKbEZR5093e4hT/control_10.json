My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. The author is on the debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't really like each other much but stayed together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted as a mediator by revealing each other's true feelings, leading to the breakup. The couple was unhappy but stayed together for their partnership. The author's intention was to help them realize they were incompatible. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. In some views, honesty is valued, especially if it prevents harm. If the couple was already unhappy, breaking them up might be seen as helping them avoid a longer-term unhappy relationship. However, others might argue that the author overstepped by mediating in their personal lives, especially without permission. The author's own interest in becoming co-captain might also be a factor\u2014are they acting out of self-interest by breaking up the competition?\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The author spoke to both James and Mary separately and shared each other's opinions. But did they have the right to do that? Relationships can be complex, and sometimes people stay together for other reasons, not just the debate. The author's actions might have caused immediate emotional distress (James was crying), which is a negative outcome.\n\nAlso, the debate team's reaction is mentioned\u2014others agreed it was a favor. So maybe the community sees it as a positive. But the author's role in causing public embarrassment or a scene during a meeting could be another angle. Did the author handle it appropriately?\n\nAnother angle: the author might have acted in the interest of the debate team's dynamics. If the couple's incompatibility was affecting their performance or causing tension, breaking them up could be seen as helping the team. But that's speculative.\n\nI should also consider if the author used the information responsibly. They learned the opinions from casual conversations. Is it ethical to spread such personal information, even if it's true? It might be seen as gossip, but if the goal is to help them make a better decision, it could be justified.\n\nThe author's own motives\u2014are they altruistic or do they have a hidden agenda to eliminate competition? The story mentions the author is planning to run for co-captains, so there's a possibility of self-interest here. If the author is trying to weaken their competition by breaking up the couple, that could be seen as manipulative.\n\nHowever, the author claims they're not friends with James or Mary, just casually talking. Their main concern is the competition, but the action was based on the couple's incompatibility. The outcome was that the couple broke up, and others agreed it was a favor. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they helped the couple realize their incompatibility, even if it caused immediate pain.\n\nBut on the other hand, relationships are personal, and the author's interference might be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's role as an outsider mediating their relationship could be problematic. The emotional impact on James, like crying and blaming the author, suggests that the action had negative consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, there are arguments both ways. The author's action might be considered justified if it helped the couple part ways for a healthier situation, but it's also possible that the author meddled in a personal matter they weren't part of. The answer could depend on cultural or situational norms. However, in many ethical frameworks, respecting personal relationships and consent is paramount, so the author might be in the wrong for intervening without their knowledge.\n"
