  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about them breaking up a couple by telling each what the other thinks. The person is on the debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The person found out that neither James nor Mary is happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. So they told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Is it right to interfere in someone else's relationship, even if the couple is unhappy? The person's intention was to help by revealing mutual negative opinions, but did they overstep? Relationships are personal, and while the couple might have issues, they might have chosen to stay together for their debate goals. The person might have thought they were doing the right thing by ending the unhappy relationship, but they didn't ask for permission or consider the emotional impact. James was crying and blamed the person, but others agreed they were doing a favor. However, the method of revealing the thoughts might be problematic. Even if the couple wasn't happy, causing a public breakup during a meeting could be seen as harsh. The person might not be in the wrong if their intent was good, but they crossed a boundary by not respecting the couple's privacy and autonomy in handling their relationship. So, it's a mix of good intentions and poor execution. Depending on cultural or ethical perspectives, the answer could vary, but generally, respecting others' decisions even if they're flawed is important. So maybe the person is in the wrong for not letting the couple handle it themselves.\n"
