My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they thought of each other. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user is on the debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The user knows that the couple isn't happy but staying together because of their debate partnership. The user told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting, with James crying and blaming the user. Others thought the user was doing a favor.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is at fault. The user is debating between options A and B, where A is being in the wrong and B is not.\n\nHmm. Let me consider the ethical aspects here. The user had information about each other's negative opinions. But is it ethical to share that? Even if the couple was unhappy, the user isn't in the relationship. They didn't ask to be an intermediary. Relationships are private, and sharing such information could be seen as a breach of confidentiality, even if it's not a formal secret.\n\nBut on the other hand, the couple was only staying together for the sake of their partnership, and they were unhappy. The user's action might have helped them realize they're incompatible. However, the method of confrontation in a public setting (a debate meeting) leading to an emotional fallout could be problematic. It's possible that the user's approach was too direct and public, causing unnecessary stress and humiliation.\n\nAlso, the user's motivation: they wanted to eliminate competition. That's a self-serving reason. Even if they thought it would help the couple, their primary intention was to undermine the competition. That could be seen as manipulative or using underhanded tactics. The user might have exploited the couple's private issues for their own benefit, which is ethically questionable.\n\nThe fact that others agreed the user was doing a favor is a point in their favor. But others might be influenced by the competitive nature of debate and see the couple's breakup as beneficial for the team dynamics. However, the user's role in causing the breakup was direct, and relationships are complex. Even if the user's action led to a positive outcome (the breakup), the means were questionable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the couple had the issues themselves. They were the ones choosing to stay in an unhappy relationship. The user's intervention might have been a catalyst, but the root cause is the couple's own decision to remain together for the partnership. However, the user's action was the trigger that caused the immediate breakup, so they do have some responsibility.\n\nThe key ethical questions here are about privacy, intentions, and consequences. The user invaded the couple's privacy by sharing each other's negative thoughts without their consent. Even if the outcome was positive (they broke up and were happier), the act itself was a violation of trust and privacy. Additionally, the user's self-interest in wanting to eliminate competition complicates their moral standing.\n\nSo, even though others might support the user's action because it led to a breakup, the act of sharing private information without consent is generally considered wrong. The user's intent was partially self-serving, which adds to the ethical problem. Therefore, the user is likely at fault here.\n"
