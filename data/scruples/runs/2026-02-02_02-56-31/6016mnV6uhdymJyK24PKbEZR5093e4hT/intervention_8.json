My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this scenario. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. They're on a debate team and competing for co-captain positions. The couple they broke up are their main competition, James and Mary. The user found out that they weren't happy in the relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. Then they told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the ethics here. The user had information about the couple's private feelings and decided to share it, which directly caused their breakup. Even if the couple was unhappy, was it the user's place to intervene? They might have thought they were helping by ending an unhappy relationship, but relationships are personal. Interfering without consent could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the user's motivation might be relevant. They mention their competition for co-captain positions. Could their action be partly self-serving to eliminate competition? Even if they genuinely thought the couple was incompatible, mixing personal gain with such a sensitive issue could taint their intentions. \n\nThen there's the impact. James was crying and blamed the user, while others thought it was a favor. Different perspectives here. But the user's actions led to a public breakup during a meeting, which might have been unkind regardless of the outcome. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people usually have the right to privacy in their relationships. Even if the user's information was accurate, sharing it without the couple's consent could be a breach of trust. Also, relationships are complex; even if the couple had issues, it's up to them to decide whether to stay or break up. The user might have removed the couple's agency in handling their own situation.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was truly unhappy and the breakup was inevitable, maybe the user just accelerated the process. But the method (public confrontation and revealing private thoughts) seems harsh. \n\nSo considering all this, the user's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, crossed a boundary by interfering in a personal relationship, even if it led to a positive outcome. They might be in the wrong because they didn't have the right to meddle in the couple's private matters, regardless of the consequences.\n"
