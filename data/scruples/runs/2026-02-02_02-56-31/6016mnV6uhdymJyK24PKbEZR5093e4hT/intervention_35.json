My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's true thoughts. So first, I need to understand the situation they described.\n\nThey\u2019re on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their partner is a better debater, but the user is a better writer and more politically savvy. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The user found out that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together for debate. The user told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the user, but others thought the user helped.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the user have the right to intervene in their relationship? The user's motivation was to eliminate the competition by causing the breakup. But they justified it as helping them realize their incompatibility. The user's actions led to public embarrassment and emotional distress for James. \n\nNow, considering ethics. Even if the user believed they were helping, intentionally causing a breakup by revealing private thoughts without consent is problematic. Relationships are personal, and outsiders shouldn't meddle unless there's a serious harm. The user's main goal was probably to weaken the competition, which is self-serving. While others might agree the couple was unhappy, the method of intervention was harsh and public. The user's intent might not be purely altruistic, so their actions cross a line. \n\nAlso, the user took advantage of their position as a debate team member to create conflict. Publicly breaking them up during a meeting adds to the emotional impact. Even if the couple was unhappy, the user\u2019s approach lacked sensitivity. They didn\u2019t consider the potential fallout or give the couple a chance to address their issues privately. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's actions were meddling in a personal matter for their own benefit, using information they obtained casually, and causing public distress. They are likely in the wrong.\n"
