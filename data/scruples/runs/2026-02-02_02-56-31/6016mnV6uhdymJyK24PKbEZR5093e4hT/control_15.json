My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. The situation involves the debate team and competition for co-captain positions. \n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author noticed that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did the right thing. The answer options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing their mutual dissatisfaction, which they thought was keeping the relationship going. However, they didn't ask for permission or consider the consequences. Breaking up a couple, even for what seems like a good reason, can have emotional consequences. The fact that James was crying and blamed the author suggests that the action caused direct harm. \n\nOn the other hand, others on the team thought the author was doing a favor because the couple was incompatible. But that's more about the outcome rather than the action itself. The key issue is whether the author had the right to intervene in their personal relationship. Relationships are private, and even if the author had good intentions, sharing someone else's private thoughts without consent can breach trust and privacy. \n\nThe author's role here is as a competitor. Their motivation might be to weaken the competition, but even if they genuinely wanted to help, the method was intrusive. People have the right to handle their relationships without external interference. The author's actions could be seen as manipulative or overstepping boundaries, regardless of the outcome. \n\nSo, even though the result might have aligned with what others thought was right, the act of revealing private thoughts without consent is ethically questionable. The author didn't have the authority to make that decision for James and Mary. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they interfered in a personal matter without permission, leading to emotional distress.\n"
