My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other really thought. They're on the debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their partner, Tim, is a better debater, but the user is better at writing and politics. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The user found out that James and Mary weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of debate. The user told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The user's intention was to help them by revealing the negative perceptions, which led to the breakup. The user's motivation was to improve their own chances in the competition by removing a strong opponent. But was it ethical to intervene like that?\n\nFirst, consider the ethical angle. People have the right to their own relationships, even if they're unhappy. By revealing private thoughts without consent, the user acted as a mediator without being asked. Even if the couple was unhappy, it's not the user's place to play matchmaker or breakup-maker. The user's actions might have been driven by self-interest (helping their own campaign by weakening competition) rather than genuine concern for the couple's well-being.\n\nThen there's the emotional impact. James was crying and blamed the user. The breakup happened publicly, which could have been embarrassing and hurtful. The user might have caused unnecessary pain, even if the relationship was troubled. The couple might have worked through their issues or decided to stay together for other reasons beyond debate. The user's intervention may have removed that possibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the user argues that the couple wasn't compatible and was keeping up the relationship for strategic reasons. If they were truly unhappy, maybe the breakup was inevitable, and the user just accelerated it. The team members agreed that it was a favor, so maybe there's some social validation here. But that doesn't necessarily make it right. The user's peers might have their own biases, especially if they're part of the same social groups competing against the couple.\n\nAnother angle: the user's role as a debate team member. Is it appropriate to meddle in personal relationships for professional advancement? It could set a bad precedent. If others do the same, it could create a toxic environment where people's personal lives are manipulated for career gains. The user's action might have crossed a line from competition to unethical behavior.\n\nAlso, the user's knowledge of the couple's thoughts\u2014how accurate was it? They might have misinterpreted or exaggerated the negative traits. Even if the user's information was accurate, sharing it without the couple's consent could be seen as a violation of trust.\n\nIn summary, while the couple's relationship might have been strained, the user's intervention was a personal overstep. The user had an ulterior motive (weakening the competition) and caused public embarrassment and emotional distress. The ethical responsibility to respect others' autonomy and privacy suggests that the user is in the wrong. However, the outcome (breaking up an unhappy relationship) might have had positive aspects. But the means used were inappropriate. So, the answer would be A (in the wrong).\n"
