  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their play aunt. The main points are that they helped care for the aunt along with their actual aunt, the aunt left them her property and money, and the relatives are upset but haven't been around much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The will was created by the play aunt, and if it's valid, then the user is the rightful heir. The relatives might contest it, but unless they can prove the will is invalid, the user is in the right legally. \n\nThen there's the moral angle. The user and their family provided care and support for years without expecting anything in return. The relatives weren't around, so the user might feel the inheritance is deserved. The play aunt's actions in the will show her intent to leave it to them. \n\nBut the user is worried about being seen as an asshole. The key here is whether the user is respecting the deceased's wishes. If the play aunt clearly intended to leave it to the user, then following that wish is morally justifiable. The relatives not being close might make the user's decision more understandable. \n\nAlso, the user isn't being greedy; they acknowledge the amount isn't huge and are willing to share non-material things. Their husband agrees it's their choice. The main conflict is between the legal right and the relatives' dissatisfaction. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong because they followed the will and provided care. The answer should be B.\n"
