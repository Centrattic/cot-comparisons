When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The setup is that they and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with chores for years. The play aunt left her estate to them, and the relatives are upset but haven't taken action. The user feels annoyed the relatives are involved now, especially since they weren't around much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the user is named as the beneficiary, then legally they are entitled to the inheritance. The relatives talking about contesting the will might not have a strong legal basis if the will was properly executed. But the user is more concerned about the moral aspect.\n\nMorally, the user provided services without expecting payment, and the play aunt left them the inheritance as a gesture of gratitude. The user's husband thinks it's up to them. The user's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable since they were absent during the play aunt's life. However, there's a social obligation to consider if the relatives should get anything, even if they haven't been present. \n\nBut the user isn't legally obligated to give them anything, and the relatives haven't made a formal claim. The user's actions are based on the play aunt's wishes, which were to benefit those who supported her. The key here is whether the user is being fair, but given the circumstances, it's more about the user respecting the deceased's last wishes. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they followed the play aunt's wishes and the relatives haven't taken formal action.\n"
