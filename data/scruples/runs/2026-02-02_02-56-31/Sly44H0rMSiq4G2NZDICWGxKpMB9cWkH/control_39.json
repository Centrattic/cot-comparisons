When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance from the \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationship between the author and the play aunt, the actions taken by the author and their actual aunt, and the reactions of the play aunt's relatives.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores because they were nearby. The play aunt wasn't blood-related, but the author and their family were close, even doing work for her without expecting payment. The play aunt left her assets to the author through the actual aunt's will. The relatives are unhappy and might contest the will, but they weren't close to her.\n\nSo, the author is being questioned about whether they're an asshole for keeping the inheritance. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe play aunt had the right to decide who she wanted to leave her estate to. If the will was properly executed, the author has a legal right to the inheritance. The relatives not being involved in her life might make their claim weaker. However, there's also the moral aspect\u2014did the author have any prior expectations or agreements about this? The author didn't expect compensation but was left the inheritance anyway. The husband's advice is to decide based on their own judgment.\n\nLegally, the author is within their rights. Morally, it's more complex. The play aunt's relatives might feel entitled, especially if the will was contested. But if the will is valid and the play aunt's intention was clear, then the author isn't in the wrong. The key here is the validity of the will and the intentions of the deceased. Since the author was the one the play aunt chose to leave her estate to, especially given their active role in her life, it's more about following her wishes. Unless the will is legally contested successfully, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
