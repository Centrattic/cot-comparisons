When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The key points here are the aunt's wishes, the relatives' possible contest, and the author's actions.\n\nFirst, the play aunt left her estate to the author's actual aunt, who is the executor, and the author. The author's husband says it's up to them to decide if they want to give anything to the relatives. The author is considering keeping everything as the aunt wished, even though the relatives are upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by following the will's instructions. The author didn't expect compensation for helping the aunt, but the aunt still left them money and property. The relatives haven't been around much, and the will is valid as per the executor. Legally, if the will is valid, the relatives can't contest it unless there's a legal reason. The author isn't obligated to give them anything unless the will requires it. Emotionally, the author might feel annoyed, but they aren't in the wrong for following the deceased's wishes unless they did something illegal or unethical. Since the author is honoring the will and the relatives were distant, the answer is likely B.\n"
