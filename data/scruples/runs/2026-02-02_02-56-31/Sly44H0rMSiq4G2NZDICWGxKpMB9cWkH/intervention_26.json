  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their play aunt. The play aunt left her property and money to the user, but her actual relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the will was properly executed and witnessed, then the user is legally entitled to the inheritance. The relatives might have a hard time contesting it unless they can prove the will was made under duress or is invalid. Since the user's actual aunt is the executor and she's supporting the will, that adds credibility. So legally, the user is probably fine.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The user helped the play aunt with chores out of kindness, not expecting anything. The play aunt was close to them, and the relatives weren't around. The user feels they were the de facto family. The relatives haven't been part of the aunt's life for years. Moral responsibility might be tricky here. The user isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless the will says otherwise. But they might feel a personal connection to the relatives, especially if they have family photos to return. But the user's husband says it's up to them, which suggests that the decision is personal.\n\nEmotional factors: The user is annoyed by the relatives' involvement now. It's understandable given their past relationship. The user might feel the relatives don't deserve the inheritance since they were absent. However, the relatives are technically family, so there's a conflict between personal feelings and familial ties.\n\nPossible consequences: If the relatives contest the will, the user might face legal challenges, but if the will is valid, it's unlikely. The user could also face social judgment if they keep everything, especially if there's a public perception that the relatives are being ignored. However, the user's actions were based on a close relationship, not any expectation of payment.\n\nIn summary, unless the will is invalid, the user isn't in the wrong legally. Morally, it's a gray area but the user's actions were based on a long-term relationship and the relatives' absence. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong to keep the inheritance as per the will. Answer B.\n"
