When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance left by their play aunt. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the person had a \"play aunt,\" not a blood relative, who lived near their actual aunt. They helped out by doing chores for both aunts, which wasn't much extra work. The play aunt left her property and money to the user via the executor, their actual aunt. The user is considering keeping it, even though the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The user feels justified because the relatives weren't around much, and their family was closer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The will is valid if it meets legal requirements, and the executor is the person who administers it. If the will was properly written and witnessed, the user is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives' contest would depend on proving the will's invalidity, like undue influence or lack of mental capacity. Since the user mentions the relatives talked to their aunt about contesting but not them, it's unclear if their claim is valid.\n\nEthically, the user had a close relationship and provided care. They didn't expect compensation but received it. The relatives were distant. The user might feel they deserve the inheritance as a way of gratitude for the care provided. The husband supports the user's decision, which suggests their relationship and feelings are in line.\n\nThe key points are legality of the will, the user's contribution to the play aunt's care, the relatives' involvement, and the user's intentions. If the will is valid, the user isn't in the wrong. However, if the relatives have legitimate grounds to challenge the will, the user might face legal issues. But since the user isn't the executor and the will is being administered by their actual aunt, it's more about following the deceased's wishes.\n\nThe user isn't legally required to give up the inheritance if the will is sound. Ethically, since the play aunt chose to leave it to them, and the user helped her regularly, keeping it isn't wrong. The relatives' unhappiness doesn't negate the will's validity unless proven otherwise. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
