  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong here. They had a play aunt who wasn't related by blood, but they helped take care of her along with their actual aunt. The play aunt left her inheritance to the user, and now her relatives are upset about it. The user is annoyed because these relatives weren't around much, and they want to keep the inheritance.\n\nHmm. The play aunt didn't have kids, so her will naming the user as beneficiary might be valid if she had the legal right to do that. The user helped out with chores, which was a mutual arrangement where they didn't expect payment. The play aunt's relatives are contesting the will, but maybe they have a legal standing to do so.\n\nBut the key points here are about legal validity and moral expectations. Legally, if the will is valid and properly executed, the user has a right to the inheritance. Morally, the user feels justified because they were close and the relatives weren't involved. The user isn't stealing; they're following the deceased's wishes. The relatives might have a legal claim, but the user isn't ethically wrong if the will is valid. The husband's opinion supports the user's right to decide. So, the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
