  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" The situation is that they helped take care of the play aunt over the years, and she left her assets to them through her actual aunt, who is the executor. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and considering contesting the will. The user feels they didn't expect anything but are now conflicted because of the relatives' reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The user and their family provided care to the play aunt, which the play aunt appreciated. She left her estate to them, and the executor supports that. The relatives weren't close and haven't been involved, but they're upset. The question is whether the user is in the wrong by keeping the inheritance.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid, the user has the right to the inheritance. The relatives would need to contest it in court, which they haven't done yet. Ethically, the user's family had a close relationship with the play aunt, and she acknowledged their care. The relatives didn't contribute as much and were distant. The play aunt's wishes, as expressed in the will, should be respected. The user's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable, especially since they were the ones providing care. The husband's advice that the decision is up to them also suggests that they have agency here.\n\nConsidering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. They acted in accordance with the play aunt's wishes, especially since she expressed them in the will. The relatives' potential contest doesn't change the user's right unless there's a legal challenge. The user's actions are justified by their long-term support and the play aunt's gratitude. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
