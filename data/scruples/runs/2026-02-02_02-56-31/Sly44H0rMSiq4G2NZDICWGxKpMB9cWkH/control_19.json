When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance from their play aunt. The situation is a bit complicated. The author helped their actual aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass for the play aunt, which wasn't much extra work. The play aunt left her property and money to the author through the executor, their actual aunt. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been around much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the will is valid and the author was named as a beneficiary, they are legally entitled to the inheritance. The relatives talking about contesting it would need to prove the will is invalid, which is a separate issue. Since the author didn't expect compensation and was just helping out of kindness, the play aunt's decision to leave them the inheritance seems like a personal choice.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author didn't expect anything and the play aunt was nice to them and their kids. The relatives weren't close, so the play aunt's choice might reflect her appreciation. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable since they weren't part of her life. The husband's advice to let the author decide makes sense because it's their choice.\n\nI should check if there's any obligation for the author to share the inheritance. Since there's no legal obligation and the relatives aren't legal heirs, the author isn't required to give them anything. The play aunt's will is her final say, so the author following her wishes isn't wrong. The relatives might not have a strong case if the will is properly executed. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the inheritance.\n"
