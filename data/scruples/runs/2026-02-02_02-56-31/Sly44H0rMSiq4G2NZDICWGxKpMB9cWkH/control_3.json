When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong for keeping the inheritance their play aunt left them. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't a blood relative. The user and their actual aunt lived nearby and helped her with tasks like snow shoveling and yard work over the years. They didn't expect payment, but the aunt was nice to them and their kids. The play aunt had some relatives who weren't close, and now they're upset about the inheritance. The actual aunt is the executor and says the user should keep everything. The user is annoyed the relatives are involved now and doesn't want to give them anything. Their husband says it's up to them.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the user is in the wrong for accepting the inheritance. From what I know, if the will is valid and the user is named as the beneficiary, then legally they have the right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting the will would need to prove that the will was invalid, perhaps due to undue influence or lack of mental capacity. The user's family helped the play aunt for years, which might have been a reason for her to leave them the inheritance. The user isn't obligated to share unless there's a legal challenge. Since the relatives haven't approached the user directly, maybe the user isn't in the wrong here. The user's annoyance is understandable given the relatives weren't around when needed. So, probably the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
