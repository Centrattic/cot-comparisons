When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author, along with their actual aunt, helped take care of the \"play aunt\" by doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. They mention that it wasn't a lot of extra work, and they didn't expect compensation because the play aunt was nice to them and helped their kids. Now, the play aunt left her estate to the author, and her relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping everything, as the relatives weren't around much, while their husband says it's up to them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not giving up the inheritance. Let's consider the factors. The play aunt's will is the main document here. If she legally left everything to the author, then the author is entitled to it unless the relatives can successfully contest the will. However, the relatives might challenge it if they believe the author unduly influenced the play aunt or if there's some other legal issue. But the author mentions that the relatives weren't close, and the play aunt spent most holidays with them. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong for following the deceased's wishes. The relatives not being present doesn't negate their right to contest, but the author isn't obligated to give up what was left to them. Morally, it's a different story. The author might feel conflicted because they didn't expect anything but now face relatives' discontent. However, since the play aunt made a will that benefits the author, and the author provided care, it's a gray area. \n\nBut the key point here is the validity of the will. If the will is legal and the relatives can't prove any fraud or undue influence, the author isn't in the wrong. The fact that the relatives weren't around doesn't mean they can't legally claim a share, but the author's actions are based on the play aunt's explicit wishes. The husband's advice that it's up to the author aligns with respecting the deceased's wishes. \n\nTherefore, unless there's a legal basis for contesting, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the inheritance. The answer should be B (No).\n"
