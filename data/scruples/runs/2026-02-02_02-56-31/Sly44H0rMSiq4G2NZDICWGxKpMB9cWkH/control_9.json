When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who isn't a blood relative. The key points here are the relationship between the author and the play aunt, the actions they took (helping with chores), and the decision to keep the inheritance despite relatives being upset.\n\nFirst, the author and their family helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. This was done as a favor since they were nearby and the play aunt was nice to them. The author didn't expect anything in return. Now, the play aunt left her assets to the author through the executor, their actual aunt. The relatives are upset and considering contesting the will, but they haven't been around much. The author is conflicted but feels justified in keeping the inheritance because the relatives weren't present.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong by following the play aunt's wishes. Legally, if the will is valid and the author is the rightful heir, they aren't in the wrong. The play aunt had the right to leave her assets as she saw fit. The relatives' potential contest would depend on legal grounds like undue influence or lack of capacity, which the author doesn't mention. Emotionally, the author might feel conflicted, but legally and morally, since they provided care and the play aunt chose to reward them, it's reasonable. The author has no obligation to share the inheritance unless legally compelled. The husband's advice to decide for oneself also supports the author's autonomy. So, the answer is B.\n"
