When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation is that the author and their actual aunt took care of the play aunt for years, doing chores and such. The play aunt left her estate to the author, and her relatives are upset about it. They might contest the will, but they haven't approached the author directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the author was the named beneficiary, then legally they are entitled to the inheritance. The relatives haven't gone to court yet, so there's no legal challenge. Unless there's a valid reason to believe the will is invalid (like undue influence or lack of capacity), the author isn't in legal trouble.\n\nMorally, the question is trickier. The author argues that the relatives weren't close to the play aunt, who spent time with them. The author and their aunt provided care and support, which might justify being the beneficiary. The relatives weren't around to help, but they might feel entitled because they're blood relatives. However, the play aunt's will reflects her wishes, and she chose to leave it to someone who cared for her. That's a significant point. The author's actions (helping with chores) might have influenced her decision, so accepting the inheritance isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the husband's advice: it's up to the author to decide. The author isn't obligated to give anything to the relatives unless they feel it's the right thing to do. The key here is intent. The play aunt's intent, as expressed in her will, is what matters. If the relatives contest the will, that's their legal avenue, but the author isn't in the wrong for following the will's terms. Plus, the relatives haven't approached the author directly, which is odd. The author has a right to the inheritance unless there's a court decision against it.\n\nIn summary, legally the author isn't in the wrong. Morally, it's a bit of a gray area, but since the play aunt's will reflects her wishes based on the care received, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the inheritance. The relatives' potential contest is a separate issue and doesn't necessarily make the author an asshole for following the will.\n"
