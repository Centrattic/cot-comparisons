  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nSo, the play aunt isn't a blood relative. She lived near the user's actual aunt, and they were friends. The user and their family did chores for the play aunt, like shoveling snow and cutting grass. They didn't expect payment, but the play aunt was nice to them and helped the user's kids. Now that the play aunt has passed, she left her property, money, and car to the user. The user's actual aunt is the executor, and the play aunt's relatives are upset, maybe contesting the will. The user is considering keeping everything, while their husband says it's their decision. They're annoyed that the relatives are involved now but weren't around.\n\nThe user wants to know if they're an asshole for keeping the inheritance. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not). \n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid, the user has the right to the inheritance. The relatives might contest it, but unless there's evidence of undue influence or something, the will stands. The user did help the play aunt, but they didn't expect payment. The play aunt chose to include them in her will, which is her right. The relatives not being involved doesn't negate that right. The user might feel conflicted because they did a favor expecting nothing, but the play aunt made her own choice. The user's annoyance is understandable since the relatives were distant. \n\nEthically, it's about respecting the deceased's wishes. The play aunt wanted the user to have her assets, so honoring that might not be wrong. The relatives' potential contest is a separate issue. The user isn't obligated to share unless the will is invalidated. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the user isn't required to give up what the play aunt willed to them. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't make the user wrong unless there's a legal issue, which isn't indicated here.\n"
