When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author, along with their actual aunt, helped care for their \"play aunt\" (a non-blood relative) by doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. The play aunt left her property and money to the author through her will. The play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will. The author is conflicted but their husband says it's up to them. The question is if the author is wrong for keeping the inheritance as per the will.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author didn't expect compensation for the help, the play aunt was close to them and their actual aunt, the relatives weren't around much, and the will was made with the author in mind.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and was properly executed, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives contesting it would need legal grounds, like proving undue influence or that the will wasn't made properly. Since the author mentions the relatives haven't been close, maybe there's not much they can do legally.\n\nEthically, the author's actions depend on their intentions. They helped out for years without expecting anything, so following the play aunt's wishes makes sense. The author might feel it's right to honor her wishes, especially since the relatives weren't involved in her care. The husband's advice that it's up to them supports the author's autonomy.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should consider the relatives, but given the distance and lack of involvement from the relatives, it's understandable the author feels annoyed. Plus, the play aunt clearly intended for the author to inherit, so respecting her wishes is key.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're following the will and honoring the play aunt's intent, especially considering the circumstances.\n"
