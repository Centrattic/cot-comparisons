When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt wasn't a blood relative, but the family helped her out over the years with chores. The real aunt is the executor and says to keep the inheritance, but the relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, the key points: The inheritance was left intentionally by the play aunt. The relatives weren't close and weren't around much. The question is about whether keeping the inheritance makes the author an \"asshole.\"\n\nThe law says that if the will is valid, the executor can distribute as per the testator's wishes. The relatives contesting the will would need legal grounds, like if the will wasn't properly made or if there was undue influence. Since the author's family was close and the relatives were distant, legally, the author is within their rights to keep what's left to them.\n\nMorally, it depends on perspective. The author didn't expect compensation for their help, but the aunt chose to reward them. The relatives being upset is understandable, but they didn't participate in her care. The author's annoyance at their sudden appearance is also valid. Since the will is clear and the relatives haven't provided a legal challenge yet, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their decision to keep the inheritance is based on the aunt's wishes and their own history with her. So the answer is B.\n"
