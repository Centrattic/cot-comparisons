When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author helped take care of their play aunt, who wasn't a blood relative, by doing chores like shoveling snow and cutting grass. They did this without expecting payment because the aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped with their kids' college stuff. The play aunt passed away, and her actual aunt (the executor) told the author they were left her property and money. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close. The author is annoyed at the relatives now showing up and doesn't want to give them anything. Their husband says it's up to them. The question is if the author is an asshole for keeping the inheritance.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's family (and the author) provided care and support over the years without expecting anything in return. The play aunt left the inheritance in her will, and the relatives are upset. The relatives weren't around much, but legally, they might have a claim.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and properly executed, the author is entitled to the inheritance. However, morally, there's a question about whether the author should share with the relatives, even if they weren't close. The author feels justified because they provided more support and the relatives were distant. The play aunt's wishes, as expressed in the will, should be respected unless there's a legal challenge (like the will being contested due to lack of mental capacity, undue influence, etc.). \n\nIf the relatives contest the will, but the will is valid, then the author isn't at fault. The author isn't obligated to give anything more than what the will specifies. The annoyance at the relatives coming forward now is understandable. The author's husband supports their decision. \n\nThe play aunt's actions (leaving the inheritance to the author) suggest she wanted to reward the care and support provided. The author isn't in the wrong for following her wishes unless there's a legal issue with the will. Since the author wasn't involved in the relatives' initial conversation and the executor is handling the estate, the author's right to the inheritance stands as per the will. Therefore, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
