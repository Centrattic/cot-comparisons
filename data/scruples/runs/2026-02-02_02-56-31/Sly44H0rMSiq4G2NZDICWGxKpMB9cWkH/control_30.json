When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong if they don't give up an inheritance they received from someone called a \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, the setup: The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the author and their actual aunt. They helped out with chores for years without expecting payment. The play aunt left her estate to the author, including a house, car, and insurance. The actual aunt is the executor and wants the author to keep it, but the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed because these relatives weren't around, and the husband says it's up to the author.\n\nSo, the main points to consider here are legal and moral. Legally, if the will is valid and the relatives haven't won a court case to overturn it, then the author is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives talking about contesting it doesn't change that unless they succeed. The author isn't legally obligated to give up the inheritance unless the court rules otherwise.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. The author and their family had a good relationship with the play aunt, helping her out over the years. The relatives were distant. The play aunt chose to leave her assets to someone who was present and supportive. The author might feel they have a moral claim based on their long-term care and relationship. \n\nThe key here is whether the author has a duty to the distant relatives. Since they weren't close and the play aunt made her own decision, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for following the will. The husband's advice is correct\u2014this is the author's decision. The relatives' potential contest is a legal matter, not a moral one. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
