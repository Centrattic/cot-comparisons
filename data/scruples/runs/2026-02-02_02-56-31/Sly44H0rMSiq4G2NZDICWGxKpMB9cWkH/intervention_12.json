When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance left to them by their \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationship dynamics, the nature of the care provided, and the intentions of both the deceased and the relatives.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't a blood relative, but she and the user's actual aunt were close friends. The user and their family helped with chores for the play aunt over the years, which wasn't a huge burden since they were nearby. They didn't expect payment because the play aunt was kind to them and helped their kids. The play aunt left everything to the user, but her blood relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nThe user feels justified because the relatives weren't close, and the play aunt spent most holidays with them. They're annoyed that the relatives are now getting involved. The user's husband says it's their decision. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for keeping the inheritance as the will states.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the executor (the user's aunt) is administering it correctly, the user has a right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting the will would need legal grounds, like proving undue influence or that the will isn't valid. Since the user mentions the relatives haven't spoken directly to them, maybe the contest isn't strong.\n\nEthically, the user acted in accordance with the deceased's wishes, as expressed in the will. The play aunt chose to leave everything to someone who cared for her, which aligns with her relationships. The user isn't obligated to give anything to the relatives just because they're blood. The fact that they offered to share family pictures shows goodwill, but the inheritance is separate.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They respected the play aunt's wishes and the arrangement they had. The answer should be B.\n"
