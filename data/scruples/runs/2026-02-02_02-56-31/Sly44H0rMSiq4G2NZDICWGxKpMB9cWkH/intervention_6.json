  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative. The key points here are the relationship dynamics and the intentions of the play aunt.\n\nFirst, the user and their family helped the play aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and yard work for years. They mention it wasn't a lot of extra work and that the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with college letters. The play aunt's relatives, who weren't close, are upset about the inheritance and might contest the will. The executor, the user's actual aunt, thinks the user should keep everything. The user is considering keeping the inheritance because the relatives weren't around much, while their husband says it's their decision.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is in the wrong by not giving the inheritance to the relatives. Legally, if the will is valid and the user is named as the beneficiary, they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives' potential contest might not hold up if the will is properly executed. Morally, the user has a history of helping the play aunt and being part of her life more than the distant relatives. The play aunt's wishes, as expressed in the will, should be respected unless there's evidence of undue influence or invalidity. The user isn't obligated to give up what they've been legally bequeathed, especially if the relatives weren't active in the play aunt's life. Therefore, the answer is likely B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
