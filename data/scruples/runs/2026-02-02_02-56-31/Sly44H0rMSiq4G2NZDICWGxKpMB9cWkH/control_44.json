When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the scenario) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The play aunt wasn't a blood relative, and the author and their actual aunt helped her with chores over the years. The author didn't expect compensation for that. Now, the play aunt left her estate to the author, but her relatives are upset and might contest the will. The actual aunt is the executor and wants the author to keep everything, but the author is annoyed by the relatives' involvement after not being around for years.\n\nSo, the key points here are the relationship between the author and the play aunt, the nature of the help provided, the play aunt's wishes as stated in the will, and the relatives' reaction. The author's husband says it's up to them to decide, but the author is questioning if they're being an asshole by keeping the inheritance.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the author is entitled to the inheritance. Morally, the author's help was a favor without expectation of reward. The play aunt's relatives weren't close, so the author might feel justified in following the will. However, the relatives' potential contest could be a red flag, but the author isn't the one contesting; they're just receiving what was given. \n\nThe author's annoyance is understandable given the relatives' lack of involvement. Since the play aunt's will is clear and the author didn't act out of greed (they didn't expect anything), keeping the inheritance aligns with her wishes. The author isn't in the wrong here because they're respecting the deceased's final wishes and the help they provided was voluntary and without expectation of payment.\n"
