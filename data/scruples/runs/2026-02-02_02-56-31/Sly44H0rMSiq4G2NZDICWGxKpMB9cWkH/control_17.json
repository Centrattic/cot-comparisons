When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who left her property and money to the author. The play aunt's actual relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close. The author and their family helped the play aunt over the years, and the actual aunt (executor) is encouraging the author to keep everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the will is valid and the relatives haven't taken legal action, the author is within their rights to keep the inheritance. But maybe the relatives have a claim if they believe the will is invalid. However, the author mentions that the relatives haven't been around for years. That's a point in their favor because the play aunt spent time with the author's family instead.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author's family provided care and support, which the play aunt appreciated. She left everything to the author as a token of gratitude. The relatives, who were distant, might not have contributed as much. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless there's a legal challenge. The husband's advice that it's up to the author to decide supports this.\n\nEmotional reactions: The author feels annoyed that the relatives are now involved after being absent. The relatives' potential contest might be more about resentment than legal right. The author's stance on family pictures shows willingness to share personal items but not the inheritance, which makes sense.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author is okay. Morally, the play aunt's gratitude justifies the inheritance. The relatives' lack of prior involvement weakens their case. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
