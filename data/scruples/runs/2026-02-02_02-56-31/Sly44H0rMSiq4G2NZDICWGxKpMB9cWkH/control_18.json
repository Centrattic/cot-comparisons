When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether they should keep the inheritance from the \"play aunt\" or give it to the relatives who might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative. The person and their actual aunt took care of her by doing chores, which wasn't a big hassle. The play aunt left her estate to them, and the actual aunt (executor) thinks they should keep it. However, the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed because the relatives haven't been around, and the aunt spent holidays with them. The husband says it's up to the author to decide.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the author do anything to deserve the inheritance? The play aunt clearly left the inheritance to them, which is her right. The relatives haven't been close, and the author didn't expect anything in return for the help. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping what was left to them.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the relatives don't have grounds to contest, the author is within their rights. But even ethically, since the relatives weren't involved and the care was done without expecting compensation, the author might not be in the wrong. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement makes sense given their lack of presence. The husband's advice supports the author's right to decide. The contestation is uncertain, and the author's actions align with the play aunt's wishes. So, the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
