  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not forgoing an inheritance left by their \"play aunt.\" So the situation is that the play aunt, who wasn't a blood relative, left her property and money to the user. The user, along with their actual aunt, did some chores for the play aunt over the years, but didn't expect anything in return. Now the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to her. The user is conflicted because they feel like they did the right thing by the play aunt, but the relatives are unhappy.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user is in the wrong. The key points here are the intentions of the play aunt, the relationship dynamics, and legal considerations. The user mentions that the play aunt and their actual aunt were friends, and the user helped out without expecting compensation. The play aunt left everything to the user, which seems like her choice. The relatives weren't close and haven't been involved, so their contesting the will might be legally possible but maybe not morally justified.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the relatives can't prove undue influence or lack of capacity, the user isn't in the wrong. Morally, since the user had a close relationship and the relatives were distant, the user might feel it's right to keep the inheritance. The user's husband agrees it's their decision, which supports the idea that the user isn't wrong to follow the play aunt's wishes.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The user could choose to share the inheritance out of respect for the relatives, but they're not obligated. The play aunt's wishes are clear, so following them isn't wrong. The relatives' potential contest doesn't necessarily make the user wrong, especially if the will is valid and the relatives had no significant role in the play aunt's life.\n\nSo the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
