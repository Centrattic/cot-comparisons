  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" So first, I need to understand the situation. The play aunt isn't a blood relative but was close to the user's actual aunt. The user and their family helped the play aunt with chores, and she left her property and money to them. The play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nThe user is being told by their actual aunt (the executor) to keep the inheritance, but they're feeling conflicted because the relatives might challenge the will. The husband says it's up to the user to decide. The core question is whether the user is in the wrong for keeping the inheritance as per the will.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the will is valid and the user is a named beneficiary, then they have the right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting the will would need to do so within the legal timeframe, which varies by jurisdiction. If the will was properly executed and witnessed, contesting might be difficult.\n\nMorally, the user's family provided care and support over the years, which the play aunt acknowledged by including them in her will. The relatives weren't close, so the user might feel justified in keeping the inheritance. However, the relatives might argue they have a right to it as blood relatives, even if they weren't close.\n\nBut since the question is about being in the wrong, legally they're probably not if the will is valid. Morally, it's a bit more subjective, but the user's actions were based on the play aunt's wishes and long-term support. The answer is likely B (No), they're not in the wrong.\n"
