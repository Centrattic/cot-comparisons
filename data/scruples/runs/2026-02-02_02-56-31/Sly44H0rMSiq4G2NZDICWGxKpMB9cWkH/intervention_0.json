  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The play aunt left her property and money to them, and the relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person helped the play aunt and their actual aunt with chores, which wasn't a big effort since they were nearby. They expected no compensation, just out of kindness. The play aunt had other relatives who weren't close, didn't visit much, and the relatives are now upset. The executor (the actual aunt) thinks the person should keep everything, and the husband says it's up to them. The main question is whether keeping the inheritance makes them an asshole.\n\nLegally, if the will was properly executed and the person is a valid beneficiary, they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting the will would need legal grounds, like proving undue influence or that the will wasn't valid. But if the will is valid, the person isn't doing anything wrong. \n\nEthically, the person might feel conflicted. They didn't expect compensation for helping, but the play aunt chose to leave them the inheritance. The relatives' reaction is their issue, especially since they weren't close. The person isn't obligated to share unless the will specifies otherwise. However, giving them family pictures shows consideration, which is good.\n\nThe person's husband supports their decision, and the executor (actual aunt) backs them. The annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable given their lack of presence in the play aunt's life. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the person isn't in the wrong. They followed the play aunt's wishes, and the relatives' potential contest is a separate legal matter. Unless there's a legal issue with the will, keeping the inheritance isn't being an asshole. The answer should be B.\n"
