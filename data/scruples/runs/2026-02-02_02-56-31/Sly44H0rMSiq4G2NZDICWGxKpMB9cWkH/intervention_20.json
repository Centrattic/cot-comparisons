  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should keep an inheritance from their \"play aunt\" or if they should share it with her relatives.\n\nFirst, the play aunt wasn't a blood relative. The person and their family provided care and help over the years, like doing chores and taking care of the aunt when her actual relatives weren't around. The play aunt left her estate to them, and the executor (their real aunt) is advising them to keep it. But the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nThe person is conflicted because they feel they did their part and the relatives weren't around. Their husband says it's up to them. The question is whether keeping the inheritance makes them an asshole.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Legally, if the will is valid, the person is entitled to the inheritance. They didn't owe the relatives anything because the relatives weren't involved in the care. The play aunt had the right to leave her assets as she wished. The person's annoyance at the relatives coming forward now is understandable since they were absent for years. \n\nHowever, morally, some might argue that the relatives have a claim, even if they weren't present. But if the will is clear and the person was a significant part of the play aunt's life, it's not necessarily wrong to honor the will. The person isn't legally obligated to share, and the relatives would have to contest it in court, which is a separate issue.\n\nSo the answer here is likely B (No, they're not in the wrong) because the play aunt's wishes were followed, and the relatives weren't part of her care. The person isn't required to give anything, and the annoyance is justified given the relatives' absence.\n"
