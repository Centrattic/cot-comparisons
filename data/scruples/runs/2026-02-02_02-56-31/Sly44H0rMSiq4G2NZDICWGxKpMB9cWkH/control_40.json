When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're being an asshole by keeping an inheritance from the \"play aunt\" when the aunt's relatives are upset. The key points here are the context of their relationship, the actions the author and their family took, and the legal/ethical implications.\n\nFirst, the author and their family helped the play aunt with tasks like snow shoveling and gardening because she lived near their actual aunt. They didn't expect payment, which is important. The play aunt wasn't close to her relatives, who didn't visit much. Now, the aunt left everything to the author, and the relatives are considering contesting the will.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the relatives aren't named beneficiaries, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The question is more about ethics. The author feels they were a good friend, helped out without expecting anything, and the relatives weren't involved. The husband says it's the author's choice, so the author is conflicted.\n\nThe author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement suggests they don't feel obligated. The fact that the relatives didn't maintain a relationship might support the author's stance. However, the relatives might argue they have a right as family, even if distant. But since the author and their family were more present, the ethical argument leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
