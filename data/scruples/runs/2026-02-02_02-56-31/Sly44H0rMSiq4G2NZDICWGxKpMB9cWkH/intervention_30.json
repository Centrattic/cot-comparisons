When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe play aunt wasn't a blood relative, but they were close. The user and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with chores like snow shoveling and lawn care over the years. It wasn't a lot of extra work, and they didn't expect payment. The play aunt also helped them with things like college letters. The actual aunt is the executor and told the user they were left everything. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The user is annoyed because the relatives weren't around much, and the play aunt spent time with them instead. The husband says it's up to the user to decide whether to give anything to the relatives.\n\nSo, the key points here: The will was made by the play aunt, so legally, unless contested and proven invalid, the user is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives aren't close, and they didn't visit much. The user and their family provided care and support over the years. The user is considering keeping the inheritance as per the will.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, legally, they probably aren't. The will is valid unless contested successfully. The user didn't do anything illegal. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The user helped the play aunt, so the aunt might have felt grateful and wanted to reward them. The relatives not being close might mean they weren't part of her life, so it's less about fairness and more about the testator's wishes. The user's annoyance is understandable because they were the ones providing support. However, there's a part where they mention giving family pictures but not money or property. That's their choice. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the user is following the will as written, unless there's some obligation to share with relatives, they aren't in the wrong. The relatives might be upset, but that's their issue. The user isn't obligated to give them anything unless the will specifies, which it doesn't. So the answer would be B (No), the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
