When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author, along with their actual aunt, helped take care of the play aunt for years by doing small chores. The play aunt left her estate to the author, which includes her home, car, and life insurance. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been close to her for years.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong by taking the inheritance. The key points here are the relationship, the care provided, and the will's validity. The author wasn't legally obliged to do the chores, but they did so out of kindness and mutual benefit. The play aunt, as the testator, has the legal right to leave her estate to whomever she chooses. The relatives might contest the will, but if the will is valid, they might not have a strong case unless there's undue influence or lack of capacity, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe author's actions seem reasonable. They provided care and the play aunt expressed gratitude by leaving her estate to them. The relatives not being involved in her care might weaken their claim. The husband's advice to let the author decide is sound. The author isn't in the wrong for following the play aunt's wishes, especially since they were close and the care was genuine. There's no indication of coercion or deceit. So, the answer should be B, No.\n"
