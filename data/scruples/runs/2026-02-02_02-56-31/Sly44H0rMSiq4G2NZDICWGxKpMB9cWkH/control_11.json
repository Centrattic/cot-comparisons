When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative. The key points are that the woman had a will leaving her property and money to the author, and her actual relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid, the author is legally entitled to the inheritance. The relatives might try to contest it, but unless there's something like undue influence or the will being invalid, the author's right to the inheritance stands. The author wasn't expecting anything, just helped out as a favor, but the aunt chose to leave her estate to them. \n\nThen, the moral side. The author did a lot for the aunt, helping with chores, and the aunt had a good relationship with them. The relatives weren't around much, so maybe the aunt felt they didn't deserve her estate. The author is now being blamed or annoyed by the relatives' involvement, but they weren't involved in the aunt's life. The husband says it's up to the author to decide, so the author is conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the inheritance. Legally, if the will is valid, they're not. Morally, since they didn't expect anything and the relatives weren't close, it's understandable they keep it. The aunt's wishes should be respected unless there's a legal reason to challenge the will. The relatives not being close might justify the author not giving them anything. The author isn't being selfish because they helped the aunt out of kindness, and the aunt reciprocated. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
