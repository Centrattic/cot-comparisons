  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they were left. The situation is a bit complex. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the user had a \"play aunt,\" not a blood relative. The play aunt and the user's actual aunt were friends. They didn't have kids, so the user and their actual aunt helped with chores like snow shoveling and lawn care. The user says it wasn't much extra work since they were nearby. They didn't expect payment because the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids later.\n\nNow, the play aunt left her assets to the user. The actual aunt is the executor and says the user should keep it. But the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The user is annoyed because the relatives weren't around much, and the play aunt spent holidays with them. The user's husband says it's up to them, but they're wondering if they're an asshole for keeping everything.\n\nSo, the key points here: the user was left an inheritance, they had a close relationship with the play aunt, provided help over the years, and the relatives weren't present. The question is whether keeping the inheritance makes them an asshole.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the will is valid and the user is the named beneficiary, then they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives might try to contest it, but unless they can prove the will was invalid (like undue influence or lack of mental capacity), the user is within their rights.\n\nMoral-wise, the user helped care for the play aunt, and the play aunt reciprocated by leaving her estate to them. The relatives not being involved much might mean they have a weaker claim morally. The user isn't obligated to give them anything unless they want to out of goodwill. But the user is annoyed that the relatives are causing issues now.\n\nThe user's husband says it's their choice. The user is conflicted but also justified in feeling entitled since they were close. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they were named in the will and provided care. However, if the will is being contested, there might be legal risks, but the user isn't necessarily immoral for following the will's instructions. The relatives might have a legal case, but that's separate from being an asshole. The user's actions were based on the play aunt's wishes, so they aren't in the wrong morally.\n"
