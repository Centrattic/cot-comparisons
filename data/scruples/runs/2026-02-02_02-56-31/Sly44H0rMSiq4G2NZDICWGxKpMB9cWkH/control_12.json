When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is wrong for not giving up the inheritance from their play aunt. The user is asking if they would be an asshole for keeping it as per the will.\n\nFirst, the situation: The play aunt wasn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt did some chores for her over the years, but it wasn't a lot of work. The play aunt left everything to the actual aunt, and the author is now being given this inheritance. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to her.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. The play aunt's relatives aren't blood relatives either, but they might feel entitled. However, they weren't involved in her life recently. The author's family spent time with her, especially during holidays, and the play aunt was supportive of their kids. \n\nMoral angle: The author didn't expect compensation for helping out, but the play aunt chose to include them. The relatives aren't close, so the author might feel justified in keeping it. The husband supports the decision, which adds to the idea that it's their choice. The relatives haven't tried to reconnect, just expressing discontent after her death. \n\nContesting the will is possible, but the author's side has the legal standing if the will is valid. The author isn't obligated to give anything to the distant relatives unless the will is contested successfully. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're adhering to the wishes of the deceased, who had a closer relationship with them and their family. The relatives' potential contest doesn't automatically make the author wrong; it's about respecting the will as written. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
