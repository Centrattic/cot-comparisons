When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about an inheritance they received from a play aunt, who wasn't a blood relative. The key points are that they helped take care of the play aunt along with their actual aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow, cutting grass, etc. They didn't expect compensation because the play aunt was nice to them when they were a kid and helped their kids.\n\nThe play aunt left her property and money to the person, and the actual aunt (executor) says they should keep it. However, the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The person feels annoyed that the relatives are involved now, especially since they weren't around much. They're considering keeping the inheritance as per the will and not giving anything to the relatives, even though they might offer family pictures.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the person is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance. Let's break it down. Legally, if the will is valid and the play aunt intended to leave it to them, then the person has the right to it. The relatives contesting the will would need to show that the will is invalid, like undue influence or lack of capacity. But if the will is valid, the person isn't legally in the wrong.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The person did help care for the play aunt, so it's possible the play aunt saw them as family and wanted to provide for them. The relatives didn't visit much, so maybe the play aunt felt closer to the person. However, the relatives might feel excluded now. But since the person didn't expect payment before and the play aunt included them in her will, it's a matter of following her wishes. The person isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless legally required, and since there's no mention of a legal obligation, the ethical stance might depend on the relationship dynamics. The person's husband says it's up to them, which is valid because it's their decision unless the will specifies otherwise.\n\nSo, putting this together: legally, they're not in the wrong if the will is valid. Ethically, it's about honoring the play aunt's wishes. The relatives' potential contest might not hold if the will is valid. Therefore, the answer is B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
