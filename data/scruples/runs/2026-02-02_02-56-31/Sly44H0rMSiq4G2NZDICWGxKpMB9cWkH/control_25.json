When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The user's actual aunt is the executor and said they should keep everything, but the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the will was properly executed and the play aunt had the legal right to bequeath her assets as she wished, then the person is within their rights to keep the inheritance. The relatives contesting might not have a strong legal case if the will is valid.\n\nOn the ethical side, the person helped care for the play aunt by doing tasks like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn, even though they weren't obligated. The play aunt was also nice to them as a kid and helped their kids. The relatives weren't around, so maybe the play aunt felt more connected to the user's family. The person isn't expecting anything in return, but they are now being given the inheritance. \n\nThe user's husband says it's up to them to decide. The person is annoyed that the relatives are involved now. They want to keep the money and property but give family pictures. That seems reasonable since the relatives weren't present during her life. \n\nBut is there a duty to share with the relatives? If the will is valid, the person isn't legally wrong. Ethically, maybe they could consider giving a small portion, but they aren't obligated. The play aunt's wishes should be respected unless the will is contested successfully. Since the relatives haven't contacted the user directly yet, and the user's aunt is the executor, the user might be in the right to follow the will. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), they aren't in the wrong.\n"
