When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationships, the care provided, and the will's distribution.\n\nFirst, the author and their family helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores like snow shoveling and yard work. They mention it wasn't a lot of extra work, and they didn't expect compensation. The play aunt was nice to the author as a kid and helped their kids with things like college letters. So there's a history of mutual support and care.\n\nThe play aunt left her estate to the author, which includes her home, car, and life insurance. The author's actual aunt is the executor and thinks the author should keep everything. However, the play aunt's relatives, who weren't close, are unhappy and might contest the will. The author feels annoyed that these relatives are now involved when they weren't around during the aunt's life.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by just obeying the will's wishes. The author's husband says it's up to them. The main factors here are the intent of the deceased (the play aunt's wishes), the care provided by the author, and the lack of involvement from the relatives. \n\nSince the play aunt explicitly left everything to the author, her wishes are clear. The author wasn't expecting payment but was doing the chores out of kindness and mutual help. The relatives were not involved in her care, which might be a key point. In many places, as long as the will is valid and not contested successfully, the executor follows the instructions. The relatives' potential to contest is mentioned, but the author isn't involved in that legal battle. \n\nThe author's annoyance is understandable given the relatives' absence. Morally, the author wasn't expecting anything but now has to deal with people who weren't supportive. Legally, unless the will is contested and overturned, the author is within their rights to keep the inheritance. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They adhered to the play aunt's wishes and had a history of support. The answer should be B.\n"
