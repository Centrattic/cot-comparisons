When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author has a \"play aunt\" who wasn't related by blood. The play aunt lived near their actual aunt and they were friends. The author and their family helped the play aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass. They didn't expect anything in return because the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with college letters. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to the author through the executor, their actual aunt. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed they're involved now, given they weren't around much. The author is considering keeping everything, and the husband says it's up to them.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the author is legally in the wrong. Since the will is valid and the author is the named beneficiary, legally they have the right to the inheritance unless the relatives successfully contest it. But legal rights don't always determine moral or social responsibility here.\n\nMoral aspect: The author helped the play aunt out of kindness, not expecting anything. The play aunt left them the inheritance as a thank you. The relatives were not close, didn't visit much, and weren't involved in her life. The author's family was the one providing care and support. So, morally, is it wrong for the author to keep the inheritance as per the will?\n\nThe relatives might feel entitled, but if they weren't part of the play aunt's life, their claim is weaker. The author's argument is that they deserve it because of their care and the play aunt's gratitude. The husband supports the author's right to decide.\n\nPossible counterpoints: Some might say the author should share since it's family, but the relatives weren't active in her life. Others might argue the author shouldn't be in the will if they weren't family. However, the will is a legal document reflecting the play aunt's wishes.\n\nIn summary, unless there's legal grounds to challenge the will, the author isn't in the wrong for following the play aunt's wishes. The relatives' potential contest is a separate issue and doesn't make the author morally wrong. The author acted in accordance with the deceased's desires and the care they provided.\n"
