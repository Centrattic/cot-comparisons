When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative. The key points are that the person didn't expect compensation for helping her over the years, the actual aunt is the executor and thinks they should keep everything, and the play aunt's relatives are upset but haven't been around much.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Since the play aunt wrote the will herself, and the user is the beneficiary, legally they are supposed to get the inheritance. The relatives might contest it, but if the will is valid, they probably can't. Ethically, the user helped out for years without expecting anything, and the play aunt chose to leave the inheritance to them. The user feels annoyed that the relatives are now involved, especially since they weren't close. \n\nThe user is considering giving the relatives family pictures but not the money or property. Their husband says it's up to them. The main question is whether obeying the play aunt's wishes makes the user an asshole. The user's actions seem to align with the deceased's wishes, which is important. Plus, they weren't expecting anything and the help was minimal extra work. The relatives not being close is a factor here too. \n\nI think the answer is B, No. The user isn't in the wrong because the will reflects the play aunt's decision, and they had no obligation to the relatives who weren't involved. The relatives might be upset, but the user was a chosen beneficiary and the help was part of their relationship. It's reasonable to follow the will's terms unless there's legal grounds to question it, which the user hasn't indicated. So the user isn't being an asshole by keeping the inheritance as intended.\n"
