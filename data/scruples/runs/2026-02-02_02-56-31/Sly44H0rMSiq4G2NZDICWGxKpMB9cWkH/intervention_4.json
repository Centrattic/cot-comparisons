When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt left her property and money to them, and the relatives are upset and might contest the will. The user's actual aunt is the executor and supports keeping the inheritance, while the user's husband says it's their decision.\n\nFirst, legally, the user probably isn't in the wrong. The play aunt made a will, and if it's valid, the user is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives might contest it, but unless there's a legal issue with the will (like undue influence), the user has a right to it. The user's argument is that the relatives weren't around, and they provided care. That's a common reason for someone to leave an inheritance to a non-relative.\n\nMoral or social angle: The user feels justified because they gave care and support over the years. However, some might argue that the relatives, even if distant, have a claim. But the play aunt clearly chose the user, so it's her right to decide. The user is not obligated to give them anything unless there's a legal pressure, but the contest might not hold up.\n\nThe user's annoyance is understandable. They were close and helped out, while the relatives were absent. The user isn't being selfish; they're respecting the play aunt's wishes. The answer is B, No, they're not in the wrong.\n"
