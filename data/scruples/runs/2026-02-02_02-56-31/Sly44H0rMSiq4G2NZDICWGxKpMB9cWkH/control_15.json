When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from the play aunt. The situation is that the author and their actual aunt helped take care of the play aunt over the years by doing chores, which wasn't too much work. The play aunt left her property and money to the author, and the relatives of the play aunt are upset and considering contesting the will. The author is annoyed because the relatives weren't around much, and they want to keep the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the play aunt intended to leave everything to the author, then legally, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives would have a hard time contesting it unless there's some legal basis like undue influence or lack of mental capacity. But the question is about moral wrongdoing, not legal issues.\n\nMoral standpoint: The author helped care for the play aunt for years, which might be seen as a reason for her to leave the inheritance. The relatives weren't involved, so their absence might make the author feel justified in keeping it. On the other hand, some might argue that the play aunt's relatives have a claim as blood family, but if they weren't close, that could affect the moral judgment.\n\nThe author's actions were based on the play aunt's wishes as stated in her will. The author didn't expect compensation before, but the play aunt chose to reward them. Since the relatives weren't present, the author might not be in the wrong for following the will. The husband's advice supports the author's right to decide.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong as they followed the deceased's wishes and had a history of care. The relatives' discontent doesn't override the will's validity.\n"
