When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt in question left her property and money to them, and the relatives are upset. The user and their family helped care for the aunt over the years, doing things like shoveling snow and mowing her lawn, which wasn't much extra work since they were nearby. They didn't expect payment, but the aunt was nice to them and helped their kids.\n\nNow, the user's actual aunt is the executor and says to keep it, but the other relatives might contest the will. The user feels annoyed that these distant relatives are involved now, especially since they weren't around before. The husband says it's up to them. The question is whether keeping the inheritance makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, the will is the key here. If the play aunt legally left everything to the user, then according to the law, the user is entitled to it. The relatives contesting it would only be possible if there's some legal ground, like the will being invalid due to undue influence, fraud, or lack of mental capacity. But since the user's actual aunt is the executor and the will is in place, unless there's a legal challenge that's successful, the user has the right to the inheritance.\n\nMoral considerations: The user helped care for the aunt for years without expecting anything in return. The relatives weren't involved, so it's understandable that the user feels they deserve the inheritance. The user isn't taking it out of greed but because the aunt wanted to reward their care. The relatives not being close might not have a strong moral claim here.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the user should consider the relatives' feelings or offer a gesture of goodwill. But legally, the user isn't in the wrong. Morally, if the user acted in good faith and the will is valid, then they're justified in keeping the inheritance. The key points are the validity of the will, the user's genuine care without expectation of reward, and the relatives' lack of involvement. So the answer is B.\n"
