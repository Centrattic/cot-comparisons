When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance. The context is that the author, along with their actual aunt, helped take care of the \"play aunt\" over the years. The play aunt left her estate to the author, and her relatives are upset about it, considering contesting the will. The author is conflicted because they feel they didn't expect anything but now the relatives are involved, even though they weren't close to the play aunt.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if the will is valid and the author is the named beneficiary, they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives talking about contesting might not have strong grounds unless there's evidence of undue influence, lack of capacity, or fraud. Since the author wasn't expecting compensation and the play aunt was close to them, it's a testamentary gift based on relationship and care.\n\nEthically, the relatives' reaction is problematic. They weren't involved in the care, yet they're upset. The author's family provided support, so the inheritance is a recognition of that. The author's husband says it's their decision, which is right. The author isn't obligated to share unless legally bound. Since the relatives haven't approached the author directly, contesting the will might not be feasible.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the will's instructions, and the relatives' objections don't negate the author's rightful inheritance. The answer should be B.\n"
