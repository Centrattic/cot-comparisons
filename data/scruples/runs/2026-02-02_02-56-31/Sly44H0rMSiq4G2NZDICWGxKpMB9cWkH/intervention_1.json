  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt\" to her relatives. First, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe play aunt isn't a blood relative, but the user and their actual aunt helped her with tasks like snow shoveling and yard work over the years. The user didn't expect payment, but the aunt left her estate to them. Now, the relatives are upset and might contest the will. The user is considering keeping the inheritance, and their husband says it's their decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the will was made by the play aunt, and as long as it's valid, the user is entitled to it. The relatives not being close or involved could be a factor. But legally, if the will is valid, they can't take it away unless they contest successfully. However, morally, should the user consider giving the relatives something?\n\nBut the user mentions that the relatives weren't around, and the play aunt spent time with them. The user's family did more for her. The play aunt's wishes are to leave it to the user. So, the user is following the deceased's wishes. The question is whether they're wrong for not giving it up.\n\nLegally, no. The user isn't in the wrong if the will is valid. Morally, it might depend on the relationship, but since the relatives weren't involved, and the user had a closer relationship, it's more justifiable. The answer would lean towards B (No), but need to check if there's any obligation beyond the will. Also, the answer should consider cultural or moral expectations. The user isn't obligated to give up the inheritance, so the answer is B.\n"
