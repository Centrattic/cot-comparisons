  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" The aunt left her property and money to them, and the relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, the key points: The user and their family helped care for the play aunt for years by doing chores. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative, and the user didn't expect anything in return. The actual aunt is the executor and says the user should keep it. The relatives aren't close and haven't visited much, but they're now upset.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the user is named as the beneficiary, they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting would depend on their legal standing. If the will was properly executed, it's hard to contest. Emotionally, the user feels justified because they provided care and the relatives weren't present. \n\nThe user's husband says it's up to them, which gives them autonomy. The user isn't obligated to share unless there's a legal challenge. The annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable since they didn't contribute. The user is following the play aunt's wishes, which were to leave everything to them. \n\nSo, considering legality and the situation described, the user isn't in the wrong. They're honoring the deceased's wishes and there's no obligation to share with distant relatives who weren't involved. Answer B.\n"
