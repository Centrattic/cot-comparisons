  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't a blood relative. The user and their actual aunt took care of the play aunt by doing chores like snow shoveling and yard work. They didn't expect payment, but the play aunt left her estate to them. Now, the relatives are upset and might contest the will. The user is considering keeping the inheritance, and their husband says it's up to them.\n\nThe key points here are the will's validity and the user's intentions. If the play aunt legally left everything to the user, then they have a right to it. The relatives haven't taken legal action yet, so the user isn't in legal trouble. Morally, the user might feel conflicted because they didn't expect compensation for the chores, but the play aunt chose to reward them. The relatives might feel overlooked, but if they weren't close, it's understandable. The user isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless the will is contested successfully. Since the user didn't do anything wrong and the will stands, they aren't in the wrong. So, the answer should be B.\n"
