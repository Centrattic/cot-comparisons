  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received. The situation is that their \"play aunt\" left them some property and money, and the play aunt's relatives are upset because they weren't close. The user's actual aunt is the executor and thinks they should keep it. The user feels annoyed that the relatives are involved now when they weren't around before.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who the user is in this scenario. They helped care for the play aunt by doing chores, which the user didn't expect payment for. The play aunt left the inheritance to them, and the relatives are considering contesting the will. The user is considering keeping the inheritance as per the will. The question is whether they're in the wrong for doing so.\n\nThe user's actions are based on the will's instructions. The play aunt had the right to bequeath her assets as she saw fit. The relatives not being close might be a valid point, but legally, if the will is valid and they didn't contest it properly, the user is in the right. The user's annoyance at the relatives' involvement now is justified if they were distant previously. The husband's advice to decide on giving anything is also valid, but the user isn't obligated to give anything against the will. So, the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong. The key points are the validity of the will, the user's prior relationship and care, and the relatives' lack of prior involvement.\n"
