When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an inheritance from a play aunt. The author, along with their actual aunt, helped take care of the play aunt for years by doing chores. The play aunt left her estate to the author through the actual aunt, who is the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author didn't expect compensation for helping the play aunt, as they were nice to them as a kid and helped their actual aunt. The relatives weren't close, hadn't visited much, and the play aunt spent most holidays with the author's family. The author is considering keeping the inheritance, while the relatives are upset. The husband says it's up to the author. The question is whether the author is wrong to just follow the will.\n\nLegal perspective: If the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the author has a right to the inheritance. But maybe there's a moral angle here. The author helped take care of the play aunt, which might be seen as a reason for the bequest. However, the relatives might feel overlooked. But if they weren't close, maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nMoral perspective: The author didn't help for money but out of kindness. The play aunt chose to leave the inheritance to them, possibly as a gesture of gratitude. The relatives not being close might mean they don't have a strong claim. However, if the relatives can prove the will is invalid or that the play aunt wasn't of sound mind, there could be legal issues. But the author isn't involved in that contest unless it affects them.\n\nIs the author at fault? They followed the play aunt's wishes as stated in the will. The relatives' potential contest is their problem unless they win. The author's actions are based on the play aunt's decision. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're obeying the will and the relatives' objections don't negate that. Unless there's a legal challenge they lose, they're within their rights.\n"
