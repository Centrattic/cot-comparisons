When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationship dynamics, the actions taken by the user and their family during the play aunt's lifetime, and the current conflict with the relatives.\n\nFirst, the user and their family provided care and assistance to the play aunt over the years. They did tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass, which weren't a huge burden since the play aunt lived nearby. The user didn't expect compensation, but the play aunt left her estate to them. The user's actual aunt, who is the executor, supports this decision, but the play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nThe user is conflicted because they feel they did the right thing by following the play aunt's wishes, but are frustrated that the relatives are now involved after not being present for most of her life. The husband's advice is to decide based on their own judgment.\n\nIn terms of legal standing, if the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the user is within their rights to keep the inheritance. The play aunt had the right to distribute her estate as she saw fit, especially since she had close relationships with the user and their family. The relatives' absence and lack of involvement over the years might support the play aunt's decision to leave her assets to those who provided care and companionship.\n\nEthically, the user isn't in the wrong because they honored the play aunt's wishes and contributed to her well-being. The relatives' discontent stems from their own lack of presence, which the user couldn't control. The user isn't obligated to share what was left to them unless legally required, which isn't indicated here. Therefore, the answer would be that the user is not in the wrong.\n"
