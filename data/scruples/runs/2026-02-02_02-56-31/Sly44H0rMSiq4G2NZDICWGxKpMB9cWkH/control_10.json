When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt wasn't a blood relative, and the user's actual aunt is the executor. The play aunt left her property and money to the user because they helped her with chores over the years. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to her. The user is annoyed that they're being involved now and don't want to give up the inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points: The will was made by the deceased, and the user is a beneficiary. The relatives are considering contesting the will. But in most jurisdictions, you can't contest a will just because you're a relative unless you can prove legal grounds like lack of mental capacity, fraud, or undue influence. Since the user's actions (helping with chores) were not part of a legal agreement, the relatives might not have a strong case. \n\nThe user is being advised by their husband that they can decide to keep the inheritance. The user feels they were the ones who provided care and support, and the relatives weren't around. The executor (actual aunt) is telling the user to keep it, which adds credibility to the will's validity. \n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They followed their play aunt's wishes as expressed in the will, and unless there's a legal challenge that succeeds, they have the right to the inheritance. The relatives' potential contesting doesn't automatically make the user wrong unless there's a court decision against them. The user isn't obligated to give up the inheritance unless they choose to out of personal ethics, but legally, they're within their rights. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
