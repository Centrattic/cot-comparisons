  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their play aunt. The play aunt left her property and money to them, even though she had other relatives who are now upset.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The user and their family helped the play aunt for years with chores like snow shoveling and lawn care. They didn't expect payment, but the play aunt was nice and helped their kids. The user's actual aunt, who's the executor, told them about the inheritance. The play aunt's relatives are unhappy and might contest the will, but haven't approached the user directly.\n\nThe user is annoyed that the relatives are involved now, especially since they weren't around much. They're considering keeping the inheritance, and their husband says it's their decision. The user wants to know if they're an asshole for following the will.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the user is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives' potential contest doesn't automatically mean the user is in the wrong. Emotionally, the user might feel conflicted, but they were doing favors without expecting anything. The play aunt's decision to leave her assets to the user could be seen as a gesture of gratitude. The user isn't legally obligated to give any of it to the relatives unless forced by a court. Since the relatives haven't approached the user directly, their grievances might be internal. The user's annoyance is understandable given their long-standing relationship with the play aunt. \n\nConsidering all that, the user isn't in the wrong for keeping the inheritance as per the will. The answer should be B.\n"
