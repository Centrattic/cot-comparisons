  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" The play aunt wasn't blood-related but had a close relationship with the user and their actual aunt. They helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores, and in return, the play aunt left her assets to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, legal standpoint: the will is valid if properly executed. Since the user was named as a beneficiary, unless the will is successfully contested, they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives haven't legally challenged it yet, so the user isn't breaking any laws by keeping it.\n\nEthically, the user feels justified because they and their family provided support over the years, and the relatives weren't around. The play aunt chose to leave the inheritance to them, which shows her preference. The user isn't obligated to share unless they feel morally bound. The husband's advice supports the user's autonomy in the decision.\n\nConsidering the effort the user and their family put in, and the lack of involvement from the relatives, the user isn't in the wrong for following the play aunt's wishes. The key points are the will's validity, the care provided, and the relatives' absence. So the answer is B.\n"
