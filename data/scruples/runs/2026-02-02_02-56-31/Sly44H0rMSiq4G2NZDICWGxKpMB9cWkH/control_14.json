When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who isn't a blood relative. The person helped take care of her and their actual aunt, and now the play aunt left them her property and money. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and properly executed, the deceased's wishes should be followed. The author wasn't expecting anything but was left the inheritance. The relatives not contesting it yet but talking about it\u2014maybe they have a legal standing? But if they weren't close, maybe the will is valid, and they can't contest it easily.\n\nThen the moral side. The author helped care for the play aunt, even though the play aunt wasn't a blood relative. The relatives weren't involved, so maybe the play aunt intended to reward the caretakers. The author's husband says it's up to them. The key here is whether the author is obligated to share the inheritance. Generally, you don't have to share an inheritance unless there's a legal obligation. Since the relatives aren't legal heirs, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it. The play aunt's will is her choice, and the author didn't do anything wrong by following it. So answer B.\n"
