When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their play aunt. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't a blood relative, but she's been part of their family for a long time. The user and their family helped out the play aunt over the years by doing chores, which wasn't much extra work since they lived nearby. The play aunt also helped the user's kids with college stuff, so there's a history of mutual support. The actual aunt, who's the executor, told them they were the beneficiaries. The relatives are unhappy and might contest the will, but they haven't done anything direct yet.\n\nThe user is conflicted because they feel they did more for the play aunt than the distant relatives who didn't visit much. They're annoyed the relatives are now involved but don't want to give up the inheritance. Their husband says it's their decision.\n\nNow, legally, if the will is valid, the user isn't in the wrong for taking what was left to them. The relatives would need to contest the will, but the user isn't obligated to give up the inheritance unless the will is proven invalid. The fact that the relatives haven't visited or been close is relevant here. The user's family provided care and support, which the play aunt might have wanted to acknowledge. \n\nEthically, it's more about the user's feelings. They might feel guilty if they think the relatives deserve a share, but they also have a claim based on their actions over the years. Since the play aunt chose them in her will, it's a testament to the relationship they built. The relatives not being involved much might support the user's decision. However, there's a risk if the will is contested, but that's a legal matter the user can't control. \n\nSo, combining legal and ethical aspects, the answer is B (No, the user isn't in the wrong). They're within their rights to accept the inheritance, especially given their long-term support for the play aunt.\n"
