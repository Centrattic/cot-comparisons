When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance left to them by their \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationship dynamics and the intentions behind the inheritance.\n\nFirst, the play aunt wasn't a blood relative, but the user and their actual aunt took care of her over the years, which included tasks like shoveling snow and yard work. The user didn't expect anything in return, but the play aunt left them her property and money. The relatives are upset because they think they should have a share, even though they weren't close to her. \n\nThe user's actual aunt, who is the executor, supports keeping the inheritance. The user is annoyed that the relatives are now contesting the will. The husband says it's up to the user to decide. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid and signed properly, the user has the right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting would need a good legal reason, like the will being made under duress or not valid. Since the user wasn't expecting anything and the play aunt clearly left her property to them, it seems she intended for the user to have it. \n\nMorally, the user might feel conflicted if they have a good relationship with the relatives, but the relatives weren't present in the play aunt's life. The user's family provided care and support, so it's not necessarily unfair that the play aunt left her assets to them. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the will is valid and if the user acted in line with the play aunt's wishes. Since the user wasn't expecting the inheritance and the executor supports keeping it, there's no indication of wrongdoing. The relatives' contesting might be out of spite or lack of understanding, but the user isn't in the wrong for following the will.\n"
