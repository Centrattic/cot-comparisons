  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're wrong for not giving up an inheritance. The situation involves a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative but left her estate to them. They helped take care of this aunt by doing chores, and she was nice to them and their kids. The actual aunt is the executor, and the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and witnessed, the relatives contesting it might not have a strong case, especially if there's a clear expression of intent in the will. The user wasn't expecting anything, but the play aunt chose to leave the inheritance to them. \n\nThen there's the moral angle. The user didn't ask for it, but they provided care and support over the years. The relatives weren't close, so maybe they didn't contribute as much. The user's annoyance is understandable since they were present and supportive.\n\nThe user's husband says it's their decision. Legally, unless the will is invalidated, they have the right to the inheritance. The relatives' potential contest is a legal hurdle, but the user might not be at fault if the will is valid. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). They're following the deceased's wishes, and the relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't necessarily make the user wrong unless there's a legal issue.\n"
