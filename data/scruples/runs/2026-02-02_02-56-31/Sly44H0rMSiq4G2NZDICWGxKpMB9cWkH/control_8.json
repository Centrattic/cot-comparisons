When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The person in question is being offered the inheritance by their actual aunt, who is the executor. The play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will, but they haven't been close.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The will is valid if properly executed. If the play aunt clearly stated that the property should go to the author and the actual aunt is the executor, then legally, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives' contest would depend on proving that the will was not made properly, like issues with mental capacity or undue influence, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nEthically, the author helped care for the play aunt over the years, even though they weren't close relatives. The play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids. The relatives weren't involved, so the author might feel they were the ones providing support. The author isn't obligated to give anything to the relatives unless the will specified otherwise. The husband says it's up to the author, so the main question is if keeping the inheritance makes them an \"asshole.\"\n\nThe key points are the legal validity of the will, the support provided by the author, and the lack of involvement from the relatives. Since the author was chosen by the deceased to inherit and there's no indication of wrongdoing in the will, the author isn't in the wrong. The relatives' potential contest is their problem if they can prove the will is invalid. The author isn't obligated to share unless the will included them. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
