When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about inheriting an estate from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The person helped the aunt by doing chores, and now the aunt left her property and money to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the legal and ethical angles here. Legally, if the will is valid and the executor (the actual aunt) is administering it properly, then the person is entitled to the inheritance. The key points are: the will's validity, any potential challenges from relatives, and the person's intentions in accepting the inheritance.\n\nThe person helped the aunt without expecting payment, which is a good point. They mention it wasn't much extra work. The aunt didn't have close relatives, so the person and their actual aunt were the main support system. The executor, the actual aunt, is advising them to keep everything. The relatives are upset but haven't reached out to the person yet.\n\nLegally, unless the relatives can prove the will is invalid (like undue influence, lack of mental capacity, etc.), the inheritance stands. However, if there's a contest, the person might have to defend the will. Ethically, the person might feel conflicted if they think the relatives should get something, but the aunt's wishes should be respected unless there's a legal issue.\n\nThe husband's advice is that the person decides. The question is whether they're in the wrong by following the will. If the will is valid and the relatives aren't legally entitled (since the person isn't a blood relative), then the answer is probably no. The person isn't in the wrong for accepting the inheritance as per the will. The relatives might contest, but that's their legal avenue. The person's annoyance is understandable given the relatives' lack of involvement. So, the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
