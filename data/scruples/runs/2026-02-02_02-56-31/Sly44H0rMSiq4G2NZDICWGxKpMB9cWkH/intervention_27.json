  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The play aunt left her property and money to them through their actual aunt, who's the executor. The aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed, the user is the rightful heir. Since the relatives haven't officially contested it, legally, the user isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a moral or social angle here.\n\nThe user and their family did help the play aunt without expecting payment. There's a sense of reciprocal relationship\u2014helping with chores, being around during holidays. The relatives weren't involved, so maybe the play aunt had a valid reason to choose the user. \n\nThe user feels annoyed that the relatives are now upset after not being around. The husband says it's up to them. The user is considering keeping everything, which is within their rights if the will is valid. \n\nMoral perspective: If the user was never promised anything and the play aunt intended to leave it to them, then they aren't wrong. However, if there's a family conflict or if the relatives are in serious need, maybe there's a case to share. But the user isn't obligated. \n\nThe key points are legality of the will, the relationship dynamics, and the user's history with the play aunt. Since the relatives aren't close and the play aunt made a choice, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
