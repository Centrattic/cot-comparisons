When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the \"play aunt\" left her inheritance to the author, but her relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author's actual aunt is the executor and wants them to keep everything. The author is considering just accepting the inheritance because they did a lot of favors for the play aunt over the years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the will is valid, then the author has a legal right to the inheritance. The relatives talking about contesting it might not have a strong case if the will was properly executed. But if the will is contested, there might be legal challenges. However, the author isn't in a position to know the validity of the will beyond what's been told to them. They were just informed by their actual aunt.\n\nEthically, the author's reasoning is that they did unpaid help for years, the play aunt was close to them, and the relatives weren't around. The author might feel they deserve the inheritance because of their contribution and closeness. On the other hand, the relatives might argue that they have a right as blood family. But the play aunt didn't have kids, and the author's family was acting as a substitute. The question is whether it's fair to prioritize the person who provided care over distant relatives who weren't present.\n\nThe author's husband says it's up to them, which suggests it's a personal decision. The author is conflicted but leans towards accepting the inheritance. The key points here are the care provided, the actual relationship (not blood), and the relatives' lack of involvement. If the will is valid, the author isn't wrong for accepting it. The relatives' potential contest might be about legal rights, but if the will is valid, they might not win. So the author isn't in the wrong because the will reflects the play aunt's wishes, and the author fulfilled their role as a caregiver. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
