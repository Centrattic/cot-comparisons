When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their play aunt. The scenario involves a family member who wasn't a blood relative but was part of their lives, and the author was given property and money through the will. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and their actual aunt took care of the play aunt by helping with chores, which wasn't too burdensome because they were nearby. The play aunt had relatives who weren't close, and the author didn't expect any compensation. Now, they're being left an inheritance, and the relatives are unhappy. The author is considering keeping it, and the husband says it's their choice.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is an asshole (wrong) for keeping the inheritance. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the following factors: the play aunt's intentions, the relationship between the author and the play aunt, the relatives' potential claim, and legal aspects. The play aunt clearly left the estate to the author, and the executor (the actual aunt) supported that. The author had a long-standing, helpful relationship with the play aunt, and the relatives weren't involved. The author also contributed to the play aunt's well-being over the years. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the play aunt had the right to bequeath her assets as she wished. The relatives not being close and not contesting the will effectively might mean the author is on solid ground. However, if the relatives have a legal claim or if the will was not properly executed, there could be complications. But the question is about being in the wrong, not legal liability. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they didn't expect compensation but did help, and the play aunt valued their relationship. Since the play aunt's wishes are followed, the author isn't in the wrong. The relatives' annoyance doesn't negate the right of the testator to choose. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
