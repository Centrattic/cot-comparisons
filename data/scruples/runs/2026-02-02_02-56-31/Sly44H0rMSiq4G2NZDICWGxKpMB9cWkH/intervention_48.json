  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their play aunt. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe user and their family helped the play aunt for years with tasks like shoveling snow and yard work. The play aunt wasn't blood-related, but they were close with the user's actual aunt. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to the user through her will. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been involved much over the years. The user is considering keeping the inheritance and feels annoyed that the relatives are now making a fuss.\n\nSo the key points here are: the user's family provided significant care and support to the play aunt without expecting anything in return. The relatives were not close. The play aunt explicitly left her inheritance to the user. The user is wondering if they're wrong for keeping it.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the user is named as a beneficiary, then they have a legal right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting might not be successful unless they can prove the will was made under duress or wasn't valid. But if the will is valid, the user isn't in the wrong legally.\n\nEthically, it's a bit more nuanced. The user's family helped out a lot, and the play aunt chose to leave her inheritance to them. The relatives weren't involved, so their claim might be weaker in terms of moral standing. However, the user might feel conflicted about the relatives' potential contest. But since they weren't around when it mattered, that could support the user's position.\n\nThe user's husband says it's up to them, which adds to the idea that there's no obligation to give it up. The play aunt's explicit wishes in the will are clear, so following them makes sense. The user isn't in the wrong because the inheritance is left to them with the executor's knowledge and approval. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't negate the user's right to it unless they can legally challenge the will successfully.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the user is not in the wrong).\n"
