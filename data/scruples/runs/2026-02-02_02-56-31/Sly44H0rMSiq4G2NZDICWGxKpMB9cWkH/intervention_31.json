When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" The aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the user's actual aunt. The user helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores, and they didn't expect anything in return. The play aunt left her property and money to the user, and now her relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user is in the wrong. The key points are the relationship, the care provided, and the will's validity. The user wasn't expecting compensation, and the play aunt chose to leave her assets to them. The relatives aren't close and haven't been around much. The user's actual aunt is the executor and supports the decision. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the user is named as a beneficiary, they have a right to the inheritance. Morally, the user provided care and the play aunt appreciated them, so accepting the inheritance isn't necessarily wrong. The relatives' potential contest might be based on lack of close relationship. The user isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless there's a legal challenge. Since the user didn't expect anything and the play aunt made her wishes clear, the answer is likely B.\n"
