When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from the \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the arrangement the family had with the aunt, the aunt's expressed wishes, and the relatives' potential contest.\n\nFirst, the family helped the play aunt with tasks like snow shoveling and lawn care over the years. The author mentions it wasn't much extra work and that they didn't expect compensation. The play aunt was also kind to the author as a kid and helped with their kids' college letters. This suggests a long-term, reciprocal relationship where the family provided services, and the aunt's gesture of leaving the inheritance is a form of gratitude.\n\nThe author's actual aunt is the executor and has already told them to keep the inheritance. The play aunt's relatives are upset but haven't been involved in her life for years. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are now contesting the will after ignoring her for so long. The husband says it's up to the author, so the dilemma is whether keeping the inheritance makes them an asshole.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and properly executed, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives' contesting would depend on legal grounds like undue influence, fraud, or lack of mental capacity, which aren't mentioned here. The author's actions align with the play aunt's wishes as expressed through the will. Ethically, the relatives weren't part of the aunt's life, so the author has a moral claim based on their long-term support. The author isn't obligated to give up what was left to them unless there's a legal challenge they lose. Since the relatives haven't approached the author directly and their contest is speculative, the author isn't in the wrong for following the will's instructions.\n"
