  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" The play aunt wasn't a blood relative, but they were close. The user and their family helped the play aunt with tasks like snow shoveling and gardening over the years. The actual aunt is the executor and says the play aunt left everything to the user. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to the play aunt.\n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid, the user has the right to inherit. The relatives would have to contest it, but if the will was properly executed, that might be hard. The user didn't expect compensation for helping out, but the play aunt left them the inheritance. The user feels they don't owe the relatives anything since they weren't around. The husband says it's up to them. \n\nEthically, it's tricky. The user might feel they deserve it because they were there for the play aunt, but the relatives might feel entitled. However, since the relatives weren't involved, the user's annoyance is understandable. The user isn't taking anything that wasn't promised; the play aunt decided on her own to leave it to them. \n\nSo, the answer would probably be B, No, the user isn't in the wrong. They're following the will's instructions, and the relatives' potential contest is their issue, not the user's. The user isn't obligated to share unless legally required, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n"
