When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if they would be considered an asshole for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" The play aunt isn't a blood relative, and the author and their family helped her out over the years with things like snow shoveling and grass cutting. The actual aunt was the executor of the estate and told the author they inherited the property and money. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they hadn't been around much. The author is annoyed by their involvement now and is considering keeping the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I should think about the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the author is a legitimate heir, then they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives might contest it, but unless they can prove the will was invalid, the author might be in the right. The play aunt's relatives not being close could matter here. If the author and their family were like family to the play aunt, and the relatives were distant, the author's claim could be stronger.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author helped the play aunt for years without expecting anything. The play aunt left them the inheritance, and the author feels they have a right to it. The relatives are now upset but weren't present. The author's annoyance is justified because they were the ones who took care of the play aunt. However, maybe the author could offer to share some of the inheritance to be considerate, but the question is if they are in the wrong for not giving it up.\n\nThe husband's advice is to let the author decide, which suggests that the husband doesn't think the author is obligated. The key points are the will's validity, the author's role in caring for the play aunt, and the relatives' lack of involvement. If the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong. If the relatives contest, but the author acted in accordance with the play aunt's wishes, they're justified in keeping it. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
