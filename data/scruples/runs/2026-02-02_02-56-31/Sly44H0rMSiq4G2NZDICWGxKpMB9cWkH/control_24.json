When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they were left by their \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative, but had a close relationship with the author and their actual aunt. The author and their family helped out with chores for the play aunt over the years without expecting payment. Now, the play aunt left her estate to the author through her actual aunt, the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been involved in her life for years. The author feels they did the right thing by accepting the inheritance, especially since the relatives were distant.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the executor is following it correctly, the author has a right to the inheritance. The relatives' potential contest would depend on legal grounds, like if the will was made under undue influence or if they were omitted despite being close. But the scenario states the relatives weren't close and didn't visit much, so maybe the will is valid. \n\nEthically, the author feels justified because they provided care and support. The husband agrees it's up to them. The key points are the long-term care and the lack of involvement from the relatives. The author isn't obligated to give up what was left to them unless there's a legal challenge they lose. Since the relatives haven't approached the author directly, just expressing annoyance through the executor, it's unclear if they'll have legal standing. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for following the will's instructions, especially since they had a close relationship and provided support while the play aunt was alive. The answer should be B, No.\n"
