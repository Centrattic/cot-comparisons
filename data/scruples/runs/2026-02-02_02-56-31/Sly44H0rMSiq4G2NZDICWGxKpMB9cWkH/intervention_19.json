  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not forgoing an inheritance. The situation involves their \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative but was close. The user and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with chores over the years. Now, the play aunt left her estate to the user through the actual aunt, who is the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but the user is considering keeping the inheritance because the relatives weren't around much.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral and legal aspects here. Legally, if the will is valid, the user is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives contesting it would depend on their relationship and the laws in the jurisdiction, but if they weren't close, maybe the will is valid. Morally, the user helped the play aunt for years, and the play aunt left them the inheritance. The user feels they didn't expect compensation but were appreciated. The relatives haven't been involved, so the user might feel justified in keeping it. However, there's a potential for conflict if the relatives do contest it. The husband says it's up to the user. The user's annoyance at the relatives' involvement suggests they might not want to share, but is it wrong to follow the will's instructions?\n\nThe key points are: the will's validity, the user's contribution, the relatives' lack of involvement, and the user's intent to keep the inheritance as per the will. If the will is valid, the user isn't in the wrong. The relatives' potential contest is a legal matter, not necessarily a moral one. The user's actions align with the deceased's wishes, which could be seen as respecting her autonomy. So the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
