When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance. The situation is that the author's play aunt left them her property and money instead of her other relatives, who are now upset. The author and their family have been helping the play aunt for years with chores. The actual aunt, who is the executor, says to keep everything, but the relatives might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the will is valid and the author is named as the beneficiary, then legally they are within their rights to keep it. The relatives talking about contesting might not have legal standing if the will is properly executed. However, if there are issues like the aunt was under pressure or not of sound mind when making the will, that could affect it. But the author doesn't mention any such issues.\n\nMoral angle: The author helped the aunt for years without expecting compensation. The aunt seemed to appreciate them, leaving everything to the author. The relatives weren't around, so maybe the author's family had a closer relationship. The author isn't obligated to share unless they feel it's right. The husband says it's up to them, which supports the author's decision.\n\nSocial perspective: People might feel conflicted. Some might think the author is being fair by honoring the aunt's wishes, while others might think they should share because it's family. But since the relatives weren't involved, the author might feel justified in keeping it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they followed the will and the executor (their actual aunt) approved, and there's no legal issue indicated, it's likely they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
