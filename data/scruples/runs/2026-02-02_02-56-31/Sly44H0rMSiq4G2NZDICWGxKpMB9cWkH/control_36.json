When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" The situation is that the play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the author's actual aunt. They helped with chores, and the play aunt left her estate to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the will is valid, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The play aunt had the right to leave her assets to whomever she chose. The relatives mentioned weren't close, so their claim might be weak. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nEthically, it's a bit more complex. The author didn't expect payment for helping, which shows they were acting out of kindness. The play aunt's relatives are upset now, but they weren't around. The author might feel justified in keeping the inheritance since they provided support and the deceased expressed her wishes in the will. However, there's a possible sense of obligation to share, but if the will explicitly states the author is the beneficiary, then the author isn't wrong to follow that.\n\nSocially, some might argue the author should share out of generosity, but the author has a valid claim. The husband's advice that it's up to the author supports their right to decide. The key points are the will's validity, the relatives' lack of prior involvement, and the author's good intentions in helping without expecting anything. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
