When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not forgoing an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" So, the setup is that the author and their actual aunt helped take care of the play aunt over the years by doing chores, which wasn't much extra work. The play aunt left her estate to the author, and her relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The will was executed, and the author is the beneficiary. Unless the will is contested successfully, the author is legally entitled to the inheritance. The relatives haven't directly communicated with the author, just with the actual aunt. If they contest, it might depend on their relationship with the play aunt and whether they were dependent on her, but the author mentions they weren't close and didn't visit much. Legally, if the will was valid, the author is okay.\n\nMorally, the question is trickier. The author helped care for the play aunt, which might justify the inheritance. But the relatives might feel left out. However, the play aunt spent most holidays with the author's family, indicating closer ties. The author isn't obligated to share unless they feel it's the right thing. The husband's advice is that it's up to the author. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the will reflects the play aunt's wishes, and they had a closer relationship. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
