  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their play aunt. The key points here are the relationship dynamics and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the user's actual aunt. The user and their family did chores for the play aunt over the years, which the user didn't expect payment for. The play aunt left her estate to the user, which includes a home, car, and life insurance. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close and didn't visit much.\n\nThe user's actual aunt, who is the executor, thinks they should keep everything. The user is annoyed that the distant relatives are now involved after years of absence. The husband supports the user's decision. The user is considering giving family pictures but keeping the money and property.\n\nIn terms of legal standing, if the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the user is entitled to the inheritance. The fact that the relatives weren't around and the user's family provided care could be seen as a reason for the bequest. Ethically, since the user didn't expect compensation and the play aunt clearly intended to leave it to them, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The relatives' potential contest is their issue, not the user's. The user is following the play aunt's wishes, which is the main point here. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
