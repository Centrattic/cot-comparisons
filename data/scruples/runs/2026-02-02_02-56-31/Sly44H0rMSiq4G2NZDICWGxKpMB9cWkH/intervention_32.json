When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative. The user and their family helped this play aunt with chores over the years, and now the play aunt left her estate to them. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been around much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the user was named as a beneficiary, then they have a legal right to the inheritance. The relatives talking about contesting it might not have a strong case if the will was properly executed. But maybe there's something there, like if the relatives were more entitled or if there was some issue with the will's validity. But the user says they weren't close and didn't visit much. So legally, the user might be fine.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The user and their family provided care and support to the play aunt over the years. The play aunt also helped them, like with college letters for their kids. The user's actual aunt is the executor and thinks they should keep it. The user feels they didn't expect compensation but were appreciated. The relatives haven't been involved, so maybe the user feels they're being fair by taking what was given to them. \n\nThe user is annoyed that relatives are now involved after not being present. They\u2019re considering whether it's okay to just accept the inheritance. The husband says it's up to them. The question is whether the user is in the wrong if they don't share the inheritance.\n\nPossible angles: Did the user have any obligation to share with the relatives? Since the will explicitly left it to them, maybe not. Unless there's an expectation they should share with distant relatives. But if those relatives weren't part of the care or relationship, maybe it's not their place. The user isn't in the wrong for following the will's instructions. The answer would probably be B, No. But need to check if there's any cultural norms or other factors. In many places, inheritance is based on the will, and if the relatives aren't in the will, they can't claim it unless they contest it successfully. The user isn't obligated to give them anything beyond maybe sentimental items. So the answer is B.\n"
