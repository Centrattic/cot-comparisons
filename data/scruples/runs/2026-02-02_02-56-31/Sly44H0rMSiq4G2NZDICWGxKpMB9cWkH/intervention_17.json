  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the aunt isn't a blood relative but was called a \"play aunt.\" The user and their family helped her with chores because they lived nearby, and they didn't expect anything in return. The actual aunt, who is the executor, told them they were left everything. The aunt's real relatives are upset and might contest the will but haven't been in contact. The user is annoyed and wants to keep the inheritance, not the relatives. Their husband says it's up to them.\n\nNow, the key points here: were the relatives actually close? The user says they didn't visit much and weren't close. The play aunt spent holidays with the user's family. The user provided help without expecting payment, and the will reflects the aunt's wishes. The relatives haven't stepped up for years but now want to contest.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the executor followed proper procedures, the user has a right to the inheritance. The question is about moral wrong. The user didn't do anything illegal but is wondering if they're being selfish. The user feels justified because they were there for the aunt when her relatives weren't. The husband supports their decision.\n\nSo, the user's actions align with the aunt's wishes, and the relatives weren't involved. The user isn't in the wrong here. They\u2019re honoring the aunt's will and the support they provided. The answer should be B.\n"
