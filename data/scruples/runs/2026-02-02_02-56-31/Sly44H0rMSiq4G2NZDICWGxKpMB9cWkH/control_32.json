When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an inheritance from a play aunt. The key points are that the play aunt wasn't a blood relative, the author and their actual aunt helped her with chores, and now she left her estate to the author. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the will is already in place and the executor (the actual aunt) is okay with the author keeping it, there might not be a legal issue. But the question is about morality. The author feels they didn't expect anything and that the relatives weren't around, so they're thinking of keeping it. The husband says it's up to them.\n\nThe author's arguments: they didn't expect compensation, the play aunt was nice to them and their kids, the relatives weren't close, and the author's family helped out. The relatives haven't been involved, so maybe they don't deserve the inheritance. But the relatives might have a legal right regardless. However, if the will is valid and they aren't blood relatives, maybe the author is entitled to it. \n\nOn the other hand, morally, is it right to take the inheritance when relatives might have claims? But the play aunt chose to leave it to the author, so maybe it's her right. The relatives not being close is a point in favor. The author is not being asked to share, but they're considering giving family photos but not the money or property. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for following the play aunt's wishes. The answer hinges on the validity of the will and the author's intentions. Since the will is valid and the relatives haven't been involved, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
