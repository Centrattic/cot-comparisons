  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I didn't forgo an inheritance?\nOne of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance. The situation is about a play aunt who left her property and money to them. The key points here are the relationship with the play aunt, the help provided over the years, and the relatives' reaction.\n\nFirst, the user and their family helped the play aunt for years with tasks like snow shoveling and gardening. They mention it wasn't a lot of extra work and they didn't expect compensation. The play aunt was also helpful to them, especially with their kids' college applications. So there's a mutual relationship built over time. The play aunt's relatives aren't close and haven't been around, but they're upset about the inheritance and might contest the will.\n\nThe user is annoyed that the relatives are involved now. They don't want to give up the money or property, only family pictures. The husband says the decision is up to them. The question is whether they're an asshole for keeping it as per the will.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the executor (the actual aunt) is following it, the user has the right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting might be a legal issue, but unless they win the case, the user is within their rights. \n\nMorally, the user feels they were close to the play aunt and provided care when needed. The relatives were distant. The user isn't taking anything they weren't promised; they were just kind and helpful without expecting anything. The play aunt's bequest was a personal choice. The relatives' potential contestation is their own issue, possibly due to their own guilt or failure to maintain a relationship.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They acted according to the will, which was the play aunt's final wishes. The answer is B.\n"
