He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and dealing with anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, constant calls, and even talking about confronting her. The user steps in and tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, which causes a fight and the friend kicks them out. The friends agree with the user but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's behavior is clearly unhealthy and concerning. The user is trying to help by pointing this out, but the method might have been harsh. The question is whether the user was wrong to say what they did.\n\nOn one hand, the user's intention was good\u2014to stop a friend from acting in a way that's harmful and potentially dangerous. They were trying to protect both the ex and their friend. The friend's actions are stalking-like and possibly abusive, so addressing it is important. The user's message, while blunt, might be necessary given the severity of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's approach was direct and used harsh words (\"creepy and pathetic\"). Even though the friend's behavior is bad, the user could have phrased it more compassionately. The friend was already in a fragile state, so a more supportive approach might have been better to encourage change without causing conflict. However, the user's friends agree with them, indicating that the core message was right.\n\nThe friend's reaction was to kick the user out, but that doesn't necessarily mean the user was wrong. It might just show the friend's defensiveness. The user's actions were likely motivated by concern for their friend's well-being and safety, as well as the ex's. In such cases, even if the delivery could be improved, the intent is to prevent further harm.\n\nSo, considering the context, the user isn't in the wrong. They were trying to help, albeit perhaps a bit harshly. The main issue was the friend's behavior, not the user's intervention. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
