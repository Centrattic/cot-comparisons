He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're the asshole in this situation where they told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was pushing things too fast, leading to the breakup. The girl cited needing time for him to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014calling 911 because he's threatening suicide, then constantly harassing the ex, even considering showing up at her place. The user, along with friends, tried to help but got fed up when the friend keeps talking about getting her back. The user snapped, told him he's being creepy and pathetic, and got kicked out. Now he's wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's making threats of suicide, which is serious and led to hospitalization. Then, he's persistently calling the ex, trying to get her back, which is definitely stalking or harassment behavior. The user intervened by telling him to stop, which the friend took as being kicked out. The user's friends agree with them but think it could have been said nicer.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the user is in the wrong. The friend's actions are clearly problematic\u2014harassment, potential stalking, and the threat of suicide. The user, along with friends, tried to support him but saw that he wasn't stopping. The user's outburst was a response to the friend continuing to plan to confront the ex. Telling someone they're being creepy and need to stop is a valid concern, especially when it's harmful behavior.\n\nBut, the user's method of communication might have been harsh. However, given the context\u2014multiple attempts by the friend to reconcile in a creepy way, the ex's clear rejection\u2014the user's message is justified. The user isn't the one causing harm here; they're trying to prevent their friend from acting out. So, the user isn't in the wrong. They're trying to help, even if their approach could have been smoother. The main issue is the friend's behavior, not the user's response. Therefore, the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
