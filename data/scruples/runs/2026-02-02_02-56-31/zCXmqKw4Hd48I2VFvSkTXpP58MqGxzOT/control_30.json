He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, got dumped, had a mental health crisis, and then kept harassing the ex. The author called him out, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. He's threatening self-harm, stalking, and not respecting the ex's wishes. The author is trying to help by setting boundaries, which is a positive action. The friends agree with the author, even if they think there might have been a nicer way to say it. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key here is intent and context. The author was concerned about their friend's well-being and the ex's safety. They intervened to stop harmful behavior. Even if the delivery was harsh, the message was necessary. The friend needed to hear that his actions were unacceptable. \n\nThe alternative is letting the friend continue down a destructive path, which could lead to more self-harm or harassment. The author's actions, though maybe not the most tactful, were aimed at helping. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong), since the intent was good and the action was necessary, even if communicated harshly.\n"
