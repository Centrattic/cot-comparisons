He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who broke up with his girlfriend and is acting out by threatening suicide, stalking her, and the writer called him out for being creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked them out, but other friends agree with the writer but said they could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out in harmful ways\u2014calling the ex, threatening suicide, possibly stalking her. The writer stepped in to tell him to stop, which caused a conflict.\n\nThe main issue is whether the writer was right to confront their friend. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic. Threatening suicide is a serious matter, and stalking is illegal. The writer's intention was to help their friend and protect the ex. However, the approach was harsh (\"creepy and pathetic\"), which might have caused the friend to react negatively. The friends agree with the message but suggest a kinder approach.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the writer is trying to do the right thing by addressing harmful behavior. However, the method could have been improved. But the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Since the friend's actions are dangerous, the writer's intervention is justified. Even if the delivery was harsh, the content was correct. So the answer is B, the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
