He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting inappropriately after a breakup, and the author confronts him directly.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend was in an eight-month relationship where he was overly committed, saying \"the one\" stuff. The breakup was because he moved too fast, and he had issues with anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex, and considering showing up uninvited. The author and friends called 911, which is a responsible action. Then, when the author confronts him about being creepy and pathetic, he gets upset and kicks them out. The friends agree with the author's message but think maybe the delivery could have been nicer.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a yes (A) or no (B) answer. \n\nThe author's actions seem well-intentioned. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking, etc. The author is trying to help their friend by setting boundaries and pointing out the inappropriateness. While the method might have been harsh, the intent was to prevent further harm to both the friend and the ex. The friends agree with the message, so the author isn't wrong about the content. The argument for AITA would be if the author's approach was unnecessarily harsh, but the friend's actions were severe enough that intervention was necessary. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted reasonably. The author did what many would consider a responsible thing: stopping a friend from acting in a harmful way. Even if the delivery could have been softer, the core message is valid. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author isn't wrong for calling out harmful behavior, especially when it's endangering others and himself.\n"
