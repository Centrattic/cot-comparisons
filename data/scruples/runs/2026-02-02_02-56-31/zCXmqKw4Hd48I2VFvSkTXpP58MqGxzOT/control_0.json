He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend dealing with a breakup in a very unhealthy way.\n\nFirst, the friend was with a girl for eight months and made grandiose statements about marriage. Then she broke up with him because he moved too fast and needs to work on himself and his anxiety. The friend's reaction was extreme: threatening self-harm, calling 911, and then continuing to stalk the ex by calling constantly and threatening to confront her in person. \n\nThe writer, seeing their friend spiral, finally snapped and told them they're being creepy and pathetic, leading to being kicked out. The friends agree with the writer's sentiment but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Threatening self-harm is a serious issue, and the friend's stalking behavior is clearly problematic. The writer intervened to stop the friend from acting inappropriately. \n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is at fault. The writer's message, while harsh, is aimed at preventing harm to the ex and possibly to the friend. The friend's actions are not only hurting the ex but could also lead to self-harm. The writer's friends agree that the behavior needs to stop, even if the delivery was rough.\n\nBut does the writer deserve blame? They called out the friend's bad behavior, which is necessary here. Even if the delivery wasn't the most empathetic, the core message was correct. The friend needed to be told to stop, and the writer took a stand when others might have stayed silent. \n\nHowever, there's a consideration of how to approach a friend in crisis. Being direct and harsh might not be the most effective, but in this case, the friend's actions are dangerous. The writer's intervention might have been necessary to prevent further harm. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the writer not being in the wrong. The friend's behavior is the main issue here. The writer's intent was to help, even if the method could have been nicer. The friends also agree that the behavior needs to stop, which supports the writer's position.\n"
