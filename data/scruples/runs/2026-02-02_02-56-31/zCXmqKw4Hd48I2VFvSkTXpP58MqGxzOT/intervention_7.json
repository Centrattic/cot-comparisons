He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship for eight months and the girl broke up because he was moving too fast. He had a mental health crisis, called 911, and then kept trying to get her back, even threatening to go to her place. The user confronted him, said he was creepy and pathetic, and now he kicked them out. The friends think the user was right but maybe could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend's behavior after the breakup sounds really concerning. He's suicidal, making threats, and stalking the ex. The user and friends tried to support him after the hospital, which shows they care. But when the user confronted him, maybe the tone was harsh, but the message was valid. The ex has made it clear she doesn't want to get back together, so his actions are definitely not appropriate. The user's friends agree with them, even if they could have been kinder.\n\nThe key points are: the user is trying to help a friend who's acting inappropriately, and the user's main concern is the friend's well-being and respecting the ex's wishes. The user's message, while possibly harsh, is pointing out harmful behavior. The friend's reaction was anger and kicking them out, but that doesn't mean the user was wrong. The user isn't the one causing harm here. They're trying to intervene to prevent further issues. So the answer is probably B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
