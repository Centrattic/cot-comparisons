He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's being really obsessive after a breakup. The main points here are the ex's behavior\u2014calling the ex, threatening self-harm, wanting to confront her in person\u2014and the author's response, telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic.\n\nFirst, the ex-girlfriend broke up because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself. After the breakup, he's not handling it well. He called 911 because he was threatening harm on himself, which is a serious issue. Then he's repeatedly contacting the ex, which is definitely not healthy. The author's friends are helping him, but when the author confronts him, he gets angry and kicks them out.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend off. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the context. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014stalking, suicidal thoughts, not respecting the ex's decision. The author is trying to help by pointing out the bad behavior. Even though the method might have been harsh, the intent was to help their friend stop harmful actions. The friends agree with the author, so maybe the author's message was necessary. \n\nBut there's a balance. Should the author have been more compassionate? Maybe. However, the alternative is letting the friend continue in a harmful pattern. The author's actions might prevent further damage. The key here is whether the author crossed a line by calling him creepy and pathetic. Those are strong words, but given the situation, they might be justified. The main issue is the friend's behavior, not the author's response. So the answer is probably B (no).\n"
