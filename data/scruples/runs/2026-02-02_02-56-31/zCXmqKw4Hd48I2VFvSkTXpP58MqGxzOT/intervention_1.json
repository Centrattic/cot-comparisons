  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for confronting their friend about his behavior after a breakup. The friend was acting in a way that sounds like stalking or obsessive behavior\u2014calling the ex constantly, threatening suicide, talking about going to her place. The user stepped in and told him he was being creepy and needed to stop. The friend was upset and kicked them out.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to help their friend by pointing out the harmful behavior. The friend was already in a fragile state, having been hospitalized. The user's actions, while direct, were aimed at stopping actions that could escalate the situation. The friends agree that the behavior needed to stop, even if the user's method could have been softer. \n\nBut was the user wrong? Well, the friend's actions were clearly problematic. The user intervened when others might have stayed silent. Even if the approach was harsh, the intent was positive. The key point is that the user was trying to prevent further harm. So, the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
