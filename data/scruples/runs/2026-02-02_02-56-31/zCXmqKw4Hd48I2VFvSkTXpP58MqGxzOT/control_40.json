He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting really badly after a breakup. The author told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic, which led to being kicked out. So, need to figure out if the author was right to say that.\n\nFirst, the friend was already in a bad state\u2014called 911 because he was threatening self-harm and kept trying to get back with the ex. The author's friends agree he's acting poorly. The author was frustrated and spoke up when they were with him. They called him creepy and pathetic, which made him angry. The key points here are the friend's behavior: stalking, threatening self-harm, harassment. The author is trying to intervene to protect the ex and maybe help their friend.\n\nThe question is whether telling someone they're being creepy is wrong. Well, sometimes how you say it matters, but in this case, the behavior is clearly problematic. The friend is abusive towards the ex, and the author is pointing out the issue. Even if the tone could be better, the message is valid. The author's friends agree they're right. Also, the friend is in a vulnerable state due to mental health issues, but that doesn't justify his actions. The author is trying to help by setting a boundary. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
