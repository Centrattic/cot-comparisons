He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, moving too fast, and then after the breakup, he's acting out\u2014calling the ex, threatening self-harm, and planning to confront her. The user intervened when they thought it was getting out of hand.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is definitely problematic. He's showing signs of not handling the breakup well, which could be a red flag for something more serious like stalking or harassment. The user's friends agree with them, so that's a point in their favor. The user's intention was to help their friend realize he's going too far and to protect the ex. \n\nBut the user's approach was direct and harsh. They told their friend he's \"creepy and pathetic,\" which can come off as judgmental. While the message was right, the delivery might have been too harsh, leading to the friend getting angry and kicking them out. The user's friends mentioned that a nicer approach could have worked better. \n\nHowever, the situation is urgent. The friend's behavior is dangerous, and the user's intervention might be necessary to prevent escalation. The alternative would be doing nothing, which could lead to the friend harming himself or harassing the ex further. \n\nSo, while the user's method could have been more compassionate, the intent was good, and the outcome was necessary. The key here is that they were trying to stop harmful behavior. The user isn't in the wrong for pointing out the truth, even if the delivery was rough. The main issue is that the friend is the one acting badly, not the user.\n"
