He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was in an 8-month relationship, moved too fast, got dumped, and then started acting out by threatening suicide, calling the ex, and wanting to confront her. The author confronted him, saying he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior after the breakup. He was threatening self-harm, which is a serious issue. The author and friends intervened, which is good. The friend's actions of continuously contacting the ex and wanting to confront her in person are definitely problematic and could be considered stalking or harassment. \n\nThe author's reaction was to tell their friend off, which the friends agreed with, though maybe they could have been more diplomatic. The question is whether the author was wrong to say that. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author was trying to help their friend by pointing out harmful behavior. Even if the friend was upset, the author's intent was to stop something that's not healthy. The friend needed to hear that his actions were crossing lines, especially since he was already in a fragile state. \n\nHowever, the way it was delivered might be a factor. The author lost it after multiple instances, which might have made the confrontation more harsh than necessary. But the content of the message\u2014saying he's being creepy and needs to stop\u2014is justified. So the author isn't in the wrong for the message itself, even if the delivery could have been better. \n\nThe friend's actions are clearly the problematic part here. The author was trying to prevent further harm to the ex and their friend. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
