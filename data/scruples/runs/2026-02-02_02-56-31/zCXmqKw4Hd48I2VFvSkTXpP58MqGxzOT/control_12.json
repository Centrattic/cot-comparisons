He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who's acting really badly after a breakup, and the author confronts him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, made big commitments like marriage, but the girl broke up because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, the friend is threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up at her place. The author steps in, tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, tells him to stop, and gets kicked out. Friends agree with the author but say maybe the approach could have been nicer.\n\nHmm. The author's actions are about stopping harmful behavior. The friend's actions are definitely problematic: threatening self-harm, stalking behavior, harassment. The author is trying to help their friend, but maybe the delivery was harsh? But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nLegally, the author isn't doing anything illegal. Ethically, they're trying to intervene to protect the ex and maybe help the friend. Even if the approach was blunt, the message is valid. The friend needs to stop, and the author is right to point out that the ex doesn't want to get back together. The friend's actions are stalker-like, so the author's confrontation is justified. The friends agree, even if they think a nicer approach could work. But since the author's intent was good, and the action was to stop harmful behavior, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. Even if the method could be improved, the intent and necessity are valid.\n"
