He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling a friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm and trying to get back with the ex. The user confronted him, which led to the friend kicking them out. The friends think the user was right but maybe could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend was in a bad state after the breakup, had been taken to the hospital, and was still persisting in contacting the ex. The user's message was direct, calling him creepy and pathetic. The user was concerned about the friend's well-being and the ex's safety.\n\nThe friend's actions are problematic. He's violating boundaries by continuing to reach out and even threatening to confront his ex. The user's intervention was to stop this behavior, which is a valid concern. However, the way they delivered the message might have been harsh. The user's friends agree with the sentiment but suggest a nicer approach.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's intent was to help, and they were addressing harmful behavior. But using words like \"creepy\" and \"pathetic\" might have been unkind. However, given the urgency of the situation, the user's actions might be justified. The main issue is whether the user's words were appropriate. Even if the message was harsh, the underlying motivation was to prevent further harm. The friend's reaction was extreme, but the user isn't in the wrong for trying to intervene. So the answer is B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
