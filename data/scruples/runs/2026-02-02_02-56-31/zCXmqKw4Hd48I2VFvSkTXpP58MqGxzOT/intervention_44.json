  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he moved too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, the friend was acting out\u2014calling the ex, threatening suicide, wanting to go to her place. The user stepped in and told him to stop, called him creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked them out. The user's friends agree but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, first, I need to assess if the user did something wrong. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014calling the ex repeatedly, threatening self-harm, stalking. The user intervened to stop this, even if the approach was harsh. The key points here are the friend's harmful actions and the user's intent to help.\n\nThe user's approach was direct and maybe not the nicest, but they were trying to prevent their friend from doing something worse. The friend's actions could be considered harassment or stalking, which is not okay. The user's friends agree with the sentiment but suggest a kinder approach. However, the user's main point was to stop the harmful behavior, which was justified.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help someone in crisis and prevent further issues. The method could have been improved, but the intent was good. The answer should be B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
