He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast. The ex-girlfriend wanted him to work on his anxiety and himself. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling her constantly, and even considering showing up at her place to \"ask in person.\" The author steps in, tells him he's being creepy and needs to stop, and gets kicked out. The friends agree with the author's stance but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Harassment, threatening self-harm, and stalking-like behavior are serious issues. The author is trying to help their friend by pointing out the problematic actions. The friend's actions are not just emotional\u2014they're potentially illegal or dangerous (like showing up uninvited at someone's home after being told not to). \n\nThe author's message is to stop the harmful behavior, which is valid. Even if the delivery could have been kinder, the content of the message is correct. The friend's actions need to change regardless of how the advice is framed. The friends also support the author's stance, so there's consensus here. \n\nI don't think the author is in the wrong. They were addressing dangerous and inappropriate behavior. Even if the friend was upset, the author had a responsibility to speak up to prevent further harm to both the ex and the friend. The alternative would be allowing the friend to continue down a destructive path. So the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
