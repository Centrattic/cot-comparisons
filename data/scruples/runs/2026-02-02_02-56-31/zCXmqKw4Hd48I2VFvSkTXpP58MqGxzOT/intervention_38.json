  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is at fault here. So the situation is about a friend who's being really clingy and acting out after a breakup. The user told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic for trying to get his ex back, which led to the friend kicking them out. The user wants to know if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the behavior of the friend. He was in an 8-month relationship, talking about marriage, but then the breakup happened because he was moving too fast and has anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up at her place. That sounds like really unhealthy behavior. The user and friends even called 911 when he was threatening harm on himself. So, his actions are concerning and could be dangerous for both him and the ex.\n\nNow, the user intervened by telling him he's being creepy and pathetic. The friends agree with the sentiment but suggested a nicer way to say it. The user was frustrated after hearing the same thing multiple times. Their intention was to stop the harmful behavior. Even though the friend got angry and kicked them out, the user's message was that the ex isn't interested and he needs to stop. \n\nI should think about whether the user's approach was appropriate. While the friend was in a vulnerable state, the user's directness might have been harsh, but the message itself is valid. The key here is that the user is trying to protect the ex from harassment and the friend from further self-harm. Even if the delivery could have been kinder, the core message was necessary. The friend's reaction (getting angry) might be due to his emotional state rather than the user's intent. \n\nAlso, considering the context of the friend's mental health issues (anxiety and possible depression), the user might have handled it with more empathy. However, the user's responsibility is to support the friend in a constructive way. The user's friends agreed with the sentiment, which suggests that the concern was valid. \n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily at fault for pointing out the problematic behavior, even if the method could have been better. The main issue is the friend's actions, not the user's attempt to address them.\n"
