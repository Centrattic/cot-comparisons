He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is at fault for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend was in an 8-month relationship, got dumped because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, he started threatening suicide, so they called 911. Then he keeps calling the ex and wants to go to her place to \"ask in person.\" The writer got fed up and told him he's creepy and pathetic, leading to the friend kicking them out.\n\nSo, the writer's actions were confronting their friend about his behavior. The key points here are the friend's actions post-breakup. He's showing signs of stalking, harassment, and possibly violating a restraining order if the ex is avoiding him. The writer's friends agree with the sentiment but thought it could have been said in a nicer way. \n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic and potentially dangerous. The writer intervened to stop their friend from behaving in a harmful way towards the ex, which could be seen as protecting the ex and preventing escalation. However, the method of confrontation might be an issue\u2014being harsh could have been counterproductive. But the message was valid: the ex doesn't want to get back together, and his behavior is inappropriate.\n\nThe writer wasn't advising or supporting the unhealthy behavior; instead, they were pointing out the reality of the situation. Even though they could have been more tactful, the intent was to help their friend see the situation clearly. The friend kicking them out is a result of the confrontation, but that doesn't make the writer wrong for speaking up. In cases where someone is in denial about their own behavior, a direct approach might be necessary, even if not the most compassionate way.\n\nSo, the writer isn't in the wrong because they're trying to help their friend realize his inappropriate actions. The answer should be B (No).\n"
