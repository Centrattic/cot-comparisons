He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The situation is pretty intense. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, moved too fast, got dumped, then started threatening suicide and stalking the ex. The author and friends had to call 911. Now the author snapped and told their friend to stop being creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The friend was already in a crisis, with self-harm threats and stalking behavior. The author's intervention was direct and confrontational, saying he's creepy and pathetic. The friends agreed with the author but thought a nicer approach might have been better.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. The author was trying to help by calling out the unacceptable actions. But the way they did it\u2014directly telling him he's creepy\u2014might have been harsh, even if the message was right. The friend was in a vulnerable state, maybe with mental health issues. The author's friends agreed, so maybe it's justified, but the delivery could be questioned.\n\nHowever, the alternative is letting the friend continue harmful behavior. The author's actions might have been necessary to prevent further harm to the ex or the friend. The key here is whether the author's message was correct. Since the ex broke up and the friend isn't respecting that, the author's message is valid. The method might not be ideal, but the intent was good. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to help a friend who was in crisis and acting dangerously.\n"
