He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for confronting their friend about his behavior after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm, and stalking his ex. The user told him he was being creepy and pathetic and to stop, which led to the friend getting angry and kicking them out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend's actions are clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm is a red flag, and contacting the ex repeatedly despite her not wanting to get back together is definitely stalking. The user's friends agree with them, so there's some social validation. But the user is questioning if they were too harsh.\n\nThe main points to consider are intent and method. The user's intent was to help their friend by stopping harmful behavior. However, the way they did it might have been harsh. Telling someone they're \"pathetic\" can be hurtful, even if the message is correct. The user might have been right to intervene but could have chosen a more constructive approach. However, the behavior they're addressing is serious, so the direct approach might have been necessary to get through to the friend.\n\nThe friend's reaction (getting angry and kicking them out) suggests he was in denial or in denial about his actions. The user's friends acknowledge they could have done it nicer, which shows they had good intentions but maybe the delivery was off. But given the situation's gravity, the user's actions might be justified despite the harsh words.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was harmful or unnecessary. Here, the user is trying to prevent further harm to their friend and the ex. The user isn't in the wrong for addressing the behavior, even if the delivery could be improved. So the answer is B.\n"
