He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for calling their friend \"creepy and pathetic\" after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening suicide, and harassing his ex. The user tried to intervene by being direct, which led to being kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend was in a bad mental state, but the user was trying to help. The key points are the friend's behavior post-breakup\u2014harassment, threats, self-harm. The user's response was to tell him off, which others agree was necessary but maybe could have been softer.\n\nIs the user wrong? Well, they were trying to prevent their friend from making things worse. However, the approach might have been harsh. But considering the context\u2014mental health crisis, harassment\u2014it's about whether the user's actions were justified. The friend needed to hear that his actions were problematic. The user's friends support them. So probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
