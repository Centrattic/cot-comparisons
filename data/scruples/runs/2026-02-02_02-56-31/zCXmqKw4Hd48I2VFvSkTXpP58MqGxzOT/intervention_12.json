He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was really intense in the relationship, moving fast, then after the breakup, he's acting out, threatening suicide, stalking the ex, and the user snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The friend's behavior is definitely concerning\u2014calling the ex repeatedly, threatening self-harm, possibly showing up uninvited. The user and their friends are trying to support him, but he's not getting the message. The user's outburst was in response to repeated attempts to get the ex back, which is unhealthy.\n\nThe user's friends agreed with the message, just thought the delivery could be gentler. So the content of the message is valid, but the tone might have been harsh. However, the friend was already in a fragile state, being hospitalized. The user's frustration is understandable. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, the friend's actions are problematic, and the user is trying to intervene. The user might have handled it more tactfully, but the core message was necessary. The friend's reaction was to kick them out, which is his choice, but that doesn't mean the user was wrong. \n\nAlso, the user's friends supported the intervention. So while the delivery could be smoother, the intent was good and necessary. Therefore, the answer is B. The user isn't in the wrong.\n"
