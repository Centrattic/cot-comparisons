  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out, calling the ex, threatening self-harm, and wanting to confront her. The user intervened to stop the behavior, which led to the friend kicking them out. The friends agree with the user but think they could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, the friend's actions post-breakup are clearly problematic. Stalking behaviors, harassment, and potential self-harm are serious. The user's concern is valid because they're trying to prevent further harm to both the friend and the ex. The user's response was direct, maybe a bit harsh, but the intent was to help. The friend was already in a crisis, so the user had to act quickly. The friends support the user, so there's a consensus that the behavior needed to stop. While the approach could have been more empathetic, the user wasn't wrong in their stance. The key is the friend's well-being and preventing escalation. So the answer is B.\n"
