  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was really upset, had a mental health episode, and was threatening self-harm. The user intervened when the friend kept trying to get the ex back, which the ex clearly didn't want.\n\nFirst, the user's friend was in a bad state. After the breakup, he was calling the ex, threatening self-harm, and possibly stalking her. That's concerning. The user and friends took care of him, even calling 911. So their initial support was good.\n\nNow, when the user confronted the friend, they said he was being creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked them out. The user's friends agree with the message but think it could have been said nicer. \n\nSo the key points here are: the user's actions were to stop harmful behavior. They were trying to help the friend respect the ex's boundaries. Even if the delivery was harsh, the content was valid. The user's intention was to support the friend's mental health and prevent further issues. The friend's reaction was defensive, but the user wasn't in the wrong for pointing out the inappropriate behavior.\n\nAlso, considering the friend's mental state, the user might need to approach this with more care next time, but the core message was right. They weren't being cruel without cause. The ex had clearly stated she didn't want to get back together, so the user was advocating for her boundaries. So, the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
