He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, moved too fast, got dumped, had a mental health crisis, and is now stalking the ex. The user confronts him, he gets angry and kicks them out.\n\nFirst, the user's friend is clearly in a bad place. He's threatening self-harm and chasing the ex, which is unhealthy and potentially dangerous. The user steps in, tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, and he reacts badly. The user's friends agree with them but think maybe they could've been nicer.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, the friend's behavior is problematic. The user is trying to help, pointing out the friend's creepy actions and the need to stop. But the way they did it might have been harsh. However, the situation is serious. The friend is emotionally unstable and in a harmful cycle. The user's message is valid\u2014his actions are creepy and need to stop. Even if the delivery could be softer, the intent is to help. The friend's reaction is about his own defensiveness and inability to hear feedback when in crisis. So the user isn't in the wrong for speaking up. They're not the one acting unhealthily. The answer is B.\n"
