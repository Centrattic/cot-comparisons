  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening suicide, and trying to get back with his ex, who had already broken up with him. The user confronted him, and he got angry and kicked them out.\n\nHmm, so the friend was in a bad state, but the user was trying to help by telling him to stop. The friends agreed with the user's approach but thought it could have been done nicer. The main question is whether the user was in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the actions. The user was trying to help a friend who was in crisis, albeit in a harsh way. The friend was acting out in a concerning manner, which the user addressed. The user's intention was to prevent the friend from doing something worse, like showing up at the ex's place or continuing the harmful behavior.\n\nOn one hand, the user's message was direct and criticized the friend's actions as creepy and pathetic, which might have been hurtful. But on the other hand, the friend's behavior was clearly problematic and needed to be addressed to prevent further harm. The user's friends supported the user's stance, so maybe the user wasn't wrong in the message, just the delivery could have been better.\n\nBut the question is about right or wrong, not about the delivery style. The user was pointing out the friend's harmful actions, which is necessary even if it's not said nicely. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
