He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and planning to confront her. The author, along with friends, tried to support him after a hospital visit but finally snapped when he kept talking about getting her back. The author called him out, leading to a fight and being kicked out. The friends agree with the author's message but think it could have been done nicer.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about the friend's behavior being potentially abusive or harassing. The author is trying to stop a friend from acting in a way that's harmful to himself and others. The ex has clearly indicated she doesn't want to get back together, so the friend's actions might be considered stalking or harassment. \n\nThe author's approach was direct and maybe harsh, but the intention was to help. The friend's actions are problematic, and the author is trying to intervene. Even if the method could have been softer, the content of the message\u2014that the friend is creepy and needs to stop\u2014is on point. \n\nHowever, the author's friend was in a vulnerable state due to anxiety and possible mental health issues. Confronting someone in that state with strong language might not be the best approach, but the author's concern is valid. The friends agree with the message, so it's not just the author's opinion. The main issue is whether the friend's behavior is wrong, which it is, and the author is right to point that out. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they're trying to prevent harmful behavior, even if the delivery could have been improved.\n"
