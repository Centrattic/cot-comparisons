  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for confronting their friend about his behavior after a breakup. The friend was acting really obsessively, calling the ex, threatening self-harm, and planning to go to her place. The user told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, which led to the friend kicking them out.\n\nFirst, the friend's actions are definitely concerning. Following someone after a breakup, especially with threats and repeated attempts to contact, is not healthy. The user's friends agree that the friend needs to stop, so there's some consensus there. The user's outburst might have been harsh (\"creepy and pathetic\"), but the alternative is letting their friend continue harmful behavior. The user was trying to help, even if their approach was direct. The key is whether the user's intention was to support their friend's well-being. Since the friend was already in crisis mode, the user's intervention, while maybe not the nicest, was aimed at stopping something worse. The friends also think the user was right. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
