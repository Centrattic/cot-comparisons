He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling their friend creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was being really clingy and threatening after being dumped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014calling the ex, threatening self-harm, wanting to confront her. The author stepped in and told him he's being creepy and needs to stop. The friend got angry and kicked them out.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the friend's behavior is definitely problematic. The author was trying to help by setting a boundary. Even though the approach might have been harsh, the message was necessary. The friends agree with the author, which suggests they saw the same issues. The key points here are the friend's threatening behavior and the author's attempt to stop it. The author isn't in the wrong because they were addressing harmful actions, even if the delivery could have been softer. The main thing is that the friend needed to hear that he was crossing lines. So, answer B.\n"
