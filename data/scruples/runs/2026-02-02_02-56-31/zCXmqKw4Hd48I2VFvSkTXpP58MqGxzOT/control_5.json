He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who was in a relationship that ended, and the friend is acting out by threatening self-harm and stalking the ex. The author confronts their friend, calls him creepy and pathetic, which leads to being kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend was in a relationship where he was moving too fast, the breakup happened, and now he's not handling it well. He's threatening self-harm, which is a serious issue. The author and friends called 911, so that's a responsible action. Then, when the author is with the friend, he's still obsessing over getting his ex back. The author tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, which the friend reacts negatively to.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's actions after the breakup. Threatening self-harm is a crisis that needs immediate attention, which the author and friends addressed. Then, the friend is still contacting the ex and considering confronting her, which is definitely inappropriate and potentially harmful. The author's intervention is meant to stop this harmful behavior.\n\nThe author's message is direct and harsh, but is it justified? The friend's actions are problematic, so the author is trying to protect the ex and prevent further issues. The friends agree with the sentiment, though they think it could have been said nicer. The author's main point is that the friend is being creepy and needs to stop, which is valid.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author could have been more supportive or used a gentler approach. However, given the severity of the friend's actions (self-harm threats, harassment), the author's intervention is necessary. The friend's reaction is his own responsibility; the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the behavior. The core issue is the friend's actions, not the author's manner of confronting him.\n\nSo, the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong. They were addressing harmful behavior, which is appropriate despite the harsh wording.\n"
