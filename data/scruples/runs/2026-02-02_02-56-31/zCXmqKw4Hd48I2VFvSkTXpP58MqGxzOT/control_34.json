He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup, and the author told him off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend was in a relationship where he pushed things too fast, leading to a breakup. After, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex repeatedly, and planning to confront her. The author confronts him, saying he's being creepy and pathetic, which led to the friend kicking them out. Friends agree with the author but think they could have done it nicer.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The friend's behavior is definitely not okay\u2014he's stalking, threatening, and showing no respect for the ex's decision. The author is trying to help by stopping this behavior. However, the way they did it might have been harsh. The question is about whether the author is at fault.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a valid reason to express concern. The friend's actions are harmful and need to stop. On the other hand, the approach might not have been the best, but the intent was good. The problem isn't the message but the delivery. Since the author's friends support them, even if they think a nicer approach could work, the core issue is the friend's behavior, not the author's right to address it.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They acted to prevent further harm, even if the method could be improved. The friend's actions are the main issue here.\n"
