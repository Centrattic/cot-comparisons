He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, got dumped because he was moving too fast, had a mental health crisis, and is now acting obsessively. The user confronted him, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is definitely concerning. Calling someone after a breakup, threatening self-harm, and following them could be considered stalking. The user stepping in to stop this behavior seems necessary. The user's friends agree with them, even if they could've been nicer. The key here is intent: the user wanted to help their friend by pointing out harmful actions. \n\nHowever, the way they delivered the message might have been harsh. Calling someone \"creepy and pathetic\" could be seen as shaming, which might not be the best approach. But given the context\u2014multiple 911 calls, the friend's mental health\u2014the user's concern is valid. The main issue is whether the user overstepped. Since the friend's actions were harmful and the user was trying to intervene, it's more about the friend's actions being wrong rather than the user's. So the answer is B.\n"
