  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and dealing with anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even threatening to go to her place. The writer intervenes, tells their friend he's being creepy and pathetic, and the friend gets angry and kicks them out. The friends agree with the writer's sentiment but think the delivery could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic. Stalking, harassment, and threats are serious issues. The writer is trying to stop their friend from engaging in harmful behavior. While the method might not have been the kindest, the intent was to help. The friends support the writer's message. \n\nBut was the writer in the wrong? Well, the friend needed to be told that his actions were inappropriate. Even if the delivery was harsh, the message was necessary. The writer's actions were in response to a friend in crisis potentially causing more harm. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to help a friend who was in a dangerous emotional state and needed to be grounded.\n"
