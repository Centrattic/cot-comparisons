He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the person is at fault for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship for eight months and moved too fast, leading to a breakup. After that, the friend is acting out, threatening self-harm, calling the ex, and wanting to confront her. The person in question told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider intent. The person was trying to help their friend by pointing out his unhealthy behavior. The friend's actions are clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking the ex, and not respecting her decision. The person intervened when their friend was in a crisis, which might show concern. However, the way they did it might have been harsh, using words like \"creepy\" and \"pathetic.\" Maybe there's a better way to approach someone in a fragile state, but the intent was to help.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions are harmful, so the person is right to address the behavior. But the method of communication could be questioned. Telling someone they're creepy might come off as judgmental, especially when they're already emotional. The friends agreed with the person but thought a nicer approach could have been used. So there's a balance between being honest and being supportive.\n\nAlso, considering the friend's mental health\u2014after a breakup and hospitalization, he's in a vulnerable state. The person might have been right to speak up, but the delivery might have been too harsh. However, the alternative is letting the friend keep acting out, which could lead to more serious consequences.\n\nSo, the person's actions were well-intentioned but perhaps not the most tactful. They might not be at fault for the content of their message since the behavior needed addressing, but the method could have been improved. However, the main issue is that the friend was being creepy, so the person had a valid reason to speak up. The key point is that the friend's actions were inappropriate, and the person was trying to stop them. Therefore, the person is probably not in the wrong.\n"
