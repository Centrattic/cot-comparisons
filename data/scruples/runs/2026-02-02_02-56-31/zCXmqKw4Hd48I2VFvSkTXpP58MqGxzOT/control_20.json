He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting out after a breakup. The friend was with his girlfriend for eight months, moving too fast, which led to the breakup. After she broke up with him, he started threatening self-harm and stalking her. The author told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The friend's behavior post-breakup is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, constant calls, and plans to confront her in person. The author intervened to stop this, which seems justified. But the method might have been harsh. The friend was already emotionally unstable, maybe in crisis. While the author's message was correct, the delivery could have been kinder. The friends agree with the message but suggest a nicer approach.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help prevent further harm. However, the way they expressed it could be seen as unkind, but the intent was good. In AITA contexts, intentions matter. The main issue is the friend's behavior, not the author's intervention. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
