  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for confronting their friend after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm, following the ex, and being obsessive. The user told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to being kicked out.\n\nFirst, the user's friend is clearly in a bad mental state after the breakup. He's threatening self-harm, which is a serious issue. The user and friends are trying to help, and after a hospital visit, they're keeping him company. The user's outburst happens after multiple attempts by the friend to pursue the ex, which is unhealthy and potentially stalking behavior.\n\nThe user's message was direct and maybe harsh, but the intention was to stop harmful behavior. The friend's actions were indeed concerning\u2014calling, threatening self-harm, wanting to confront the ex. The user's friends agree with the sentiment, even if the delivery could have been nicer. So, the user's action was to prevent further harm, both to the friend and possibly to the ex. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend's behavior is dangerous, the user's intent was to help, and the message, while blunt, was necessary. The user might have handled it more gently, but the content of the message is justified. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
