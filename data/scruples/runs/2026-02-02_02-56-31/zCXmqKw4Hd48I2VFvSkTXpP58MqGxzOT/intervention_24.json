  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself. After the breakup, the friend started threatening self-harm, was taken to the hospital, and keeps trying to contact the ex, even considering going to her place. The user, along with friends, supported him after the hospital visit. But when the user finally told him to stop being creepy and to accept that the ex doesn't want to get back, the friend got angry and kicked them out.\n\nThe user is wondering if they were wrong to confront their friend. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, on one hand, the user is trying to help their friend by stopping his obsessive behavior, which could be harmful. The ex has clearly stated she doesn't want to get back together. The friend's actions (constant calls, threatening to visit) are indeed concerning and possibly stalker-ish. The user's friends agree with them, even if they think the delivery could have been nicer. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user was too harsh in their approach? But the friend was being told multiple times he's being creepy and pathetic, and he reacted by kicking them out. The user's concern seems valid because the friend's behavior is not healthy. Also, after a hospital visit for self-harm, it's crucial to address the harmful behavior to prevent further issues.\n\nI think the user isn't wrong. They were trying to help a friend who's clearly in a bad state, and the advice was necessary. Even if the delivery could have been softer, the message was important. The friend's reaction is more about his own emotional state rather than the user's rightness. So the answer is B.\n"
