He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about their friend acting creepy after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, got dumped, then became suicidal and started threatening self-harm. Now he keeps trying to get the ex back, even saying he might go to her place. The author tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, which leads to being kicked out. Friends say they agree but maybe could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's threatening self-harm, contacting the ex repeatedly, and considering showing up uninvited. The author's reaction is to confront him, stating he's being creepy and needs to stop. \n\nThe author's intention seems to be stopping harmful behavior. The friend's actions are clearly problematic and could be considered stalking or harassment. The author's words, while harsh (\"creepy\" and \"pathetic\"), are meant to make the friend realize his mistakes. The friends back up the author's stance. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might not have been the most constructive. They could have suggested seeking professional help instead of just calling him names. But the core message\u2014that the friend needs to stop\u2014is valid and necessary. The friend's actions are dangerous, and the author is trying to prevent further harm. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not wrong in pointing out the friend's harmful behavior. The method could have been kinder, but the intent is to help, not to be cruel. The friend's actions are the real issue here. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
