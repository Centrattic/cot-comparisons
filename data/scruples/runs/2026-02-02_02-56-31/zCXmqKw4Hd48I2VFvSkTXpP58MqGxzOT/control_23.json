He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend was in an 8-month relationship where he pushed for marriage and moved too fast. The girl broke up because he had anxiety and needed time. After the breakup, the friend became unstable, leading to a 911 call. He's been threatening self-harm, calling the ex, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, along with friends, tried to help but got frustrated and told the friend he was being creepy and pathetic. The friend kicked them out. The friends agree with the author but think a nicer approach might have been better.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether telling someone they're being creepy and pathetic in this context is wrong. The author was trying to help, but their method might have been harsh. However, the friend's behavior is definitely problematic\u2014stalking, threats, not respecting the ex's wishes. The author's intent was to stop harmful behavior, even if the delivery was rough. The friends support the author, which suggests the action was necessary. The key here is the friend's actions being inappropriate and the author trying to intervene. The author isn't in the wrong because the friend's behavior needed to be addressed, even if the approach could have been softer. The answer is B (No).\n"
