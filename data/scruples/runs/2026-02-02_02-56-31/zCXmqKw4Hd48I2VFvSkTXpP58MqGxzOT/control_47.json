He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who's being really obsessive after a breakup. The ex-girlfriend broke up because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend is threatening self-harm, calling her non-stop, and considering showing up at her place. The author steps in, tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, and that she doesn't want to get back together. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior is clearly unhealthy and potentially dangerous. He's not just upset; he's acting out in ways that could harm himself or others. The author's friends agree with the message, even if they think the delivery could have been softer. The key points here are the friend's actions post-breakup and the author's intervention.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the friend isn't respecting the ex's wishes and is engaging in stalking or harassing behavior. Telling someone they're being creepy and to stop is a valid concern, especially when safety is involved. However, the method of delivery might matter. The author \"lost it\" after multiple instances, which might mean they came on too strong or used harsh language. While the message is right, the approach could have been more constructive. But the core message\u2014stopping the behavior\u2014is necessary.\n\nThe friend's reaction (kicked them out) is more about defensiveness than the author being wrong. Also, the friends support the author's stance, so it's not like they're acting alone. The author isn't trying to be cruel but is trying to prevent harm. So, even if the delivery could have been better, the intent is good. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the behavior they're addressing is problematic. The answer would be B (No).\n"
