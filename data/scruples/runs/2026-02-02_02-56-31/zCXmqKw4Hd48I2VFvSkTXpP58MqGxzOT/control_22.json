He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, let's look at the context. The friend had a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out by threatening self-harm and contacting the ex constantly. The user intervened, told him he was being creepy and pathetic, and he got angry and kicked them out. Friends agree with the user's sentiment but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here: the friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking the ex, harassment. The user is trying to help by pointing out the behavior. The question is whether the user was wrong in how they communicated that.\n\nThe user's message was direct and maybe harsh (\"creepy and pathetic\"), but the friends agree with the message. The alternative is that the user could have been more tactful, but the core message was valid. The friend needed to hear that his actions were wrong. The user's intention was to stop harmful behavior, not to attack personally. The friend's reaction was defensive, but that doesn't make the user wrong for speaking up. The user's friends support the stance, which suggests they saw the behavior as problematic too.\n\nIn terms of moral culpability, acting to prevent someone from acting on harmful impulses isn't wrong. Even if the delivery could have been softer, the intent was to help. The user isn't in the wrong for calling out the behavior, even if they could have phrased it better. The main issue is the friend's actions, not the user's response.\n"
