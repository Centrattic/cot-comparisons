He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship for eight months and was moving too fast. The ex-girlfriend broke up because he needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend started threatening self-harm, called 911, and the friend was hospitalized. He kept contacting her and wanted to confront her. The narrator, along with friends, took turns helping him. During their time together, the narrator snapped after hearing him talk about getting her back multiple times. They told him he's being creepy and pathetic, which led to a fight and the friend kicked them out. Other friends agreed with the narrator but thought it could have been done more nicely.\n\nNow, considering ethics and boundaries. The friend's actions are clearly stalker-like and abusive after the breakup. The ex wants to end the relationship, and the friend is not respecting that. The narrator's friends support their action, even if they think the approach could have been gentler. The threat of self-harm is serious, but the narrator's intervention was to stop harmful behavior towards the ex. In such situations, it's important to address the behavior to prevent further harm. The problem is not the content of the message but the manner. However, the core issue is that the friend's actions are toxic and need to be stopped. The narrator is trying to stop that behavior, so even if the delivery was harsh, the intent was to help. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
