He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who's acting creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The author told their friend to stop, which led to some backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening suicide, obsessively contacting the ex, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, along with friends, tried to help him after a hospital visit. When the author finally snapped and called him creepy and pathetic, the friend kicked them out. The friends agree with the author's message but think a nicer approach might have been better.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider if the author had a responsibility to intervene. The friend was clearly in a bad state, with suicidal thoughts and stalking behavior. The author's friends agree that the friend needs to stop, so the author's intention was to help. Even though the approach might not have been the most tactful, the content of the message was valid\u2014calling out harmful behavior. The friend was already being advised by others, so the author wasn't the only one concerned. \n\nHowever, the method could be debated. Maybe a more compassionate approach would have been better to avoid making the friend defensive. But the core message was correct. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the friend's harmful actions. The problem is the behavior itself, not the author's criticism. So the answer should be B.\n"
