He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, got dumped, then started threatening self-harm and stalking the ex. The author told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, which led to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's behavior. He's showing signs of unhealthy behavior post-breakup. Calling the ex repeatedly, threatening self-harm, maybe showing up at her place. That's definitely not okay. The author intervened because the friend's actions were harmful and potentially dangerous.\n\nThe author's friends agree with them, even if they think they could have been nicer. The main question is whether the author was wrong to confront their friend. The friend's actions are problematic, so pointing that out seems necessary to prevent further harm. But is the author in the wrong for being harsh? The friend did get kicked out, but the author's intent was to stop dangerous behavior. The alternative might be enabling the behavior by not speaking up.\n\nI think the key here is that the author was right to address the behavior, even if the delivery could have been better. The friend's actions were harmful, and the author had a responsibility to intervene. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
