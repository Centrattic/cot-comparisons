He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship for eight months and was moving too fast, leading to the breakup. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014calling 911 because he's threatening self-harm, making constant calls to the ex, and even considering showing up at her place. The user, after trying to support him, finally snaps and tells him to stop, calling him creepy and pathetic. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. The user's friends agree with the sentiment but maybe the delivery could have been better.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the user was right to confront their friend so directly. The friend's actions are clearly problematic\u2014harassment, potential stalking, and self-harm threats. The user is trying to help by intervening, but the method might have been harsh.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? Well, the friend's behavior is concerning. The user is pointing out the reality of the situation, that the ex doesn't want to get back together. The user's friends agree, so maybe the user had a valid point. However, the way it was delivered might have been unkind, especially given the friend's emotional state post-breakup and hospitalization.\n\nBut the key here is that the user is trying to help prevent further harm. The friend's actions are not just about moving on; they involve potential harm to himself and harassment. So, the user's intervention, while possibly harsh, is necessary to stop dangerous behavior. The user's friends think they could have done it nicer but agree with the message.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't wrong for pointing out harmful behavior. Even if the delivery could have been better, the intent was to help. The friend's actions are clearly crossing boundaries, so the user isn't the one at fault here. So the answer should be B (No, the user isn't in the wrong).\n"
