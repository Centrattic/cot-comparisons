He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup, and the author told him off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend was in an 8-month relationship, pushing for marriage too fast, leading to the breakup. After the split, he's acting out\u2014calling the ex, threatening self-harm, wanting to confront her. The author, after trying to support him, finally snaps and calls him creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nSo, the key points: the friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014stalking, harassment, potential self-harm. The author is concerned and steps in to stop the harmful behavior. Friends agree with the author but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, the friend's actions are wrong, and the author is trying to help by confronting the issue. Even if the method was harsh, the intent was to stop harmful behavior. Friends support the author, so they likely see it as justified. The author isn't being cruel for no reason; they're addressing a real problem. The friend's reaction (getting angry and kicking them out) doesn't negate the author's right to speak up. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
