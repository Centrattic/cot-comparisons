  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up uninvited. The author intervened, told their friend he's being creepy and needs to stop, and got kicked out. Friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the friend's behavior is clearly unhealthy and potentially stalking. The author was trying to help, even if the approach was harsh. The key points here are the friend's harmful actions and the author's attempt to stop them. The author's message, while direct, is valid because the friend needs to stop these behaviors. The friends agree, which suggests it's a common concern. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the problematic actions, even if the delivery could have been softer. The main issue is the friend's behavior, not the author's response.\n"
