He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points.\n\nThe friend was in a relationship for eight months and was moving too fast. The girl broke up because he wasn't handling his anxiety and needed to work on himself. After the breakup, the friend lost it, had a mental health crisis, was hospitalized, and then kept contacting the ex, even threatening to show up at her place. The author, frustrated, told him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to the friend kicking them out. Friends agree with the message but think the delivery could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, the friend's actions are definitely not okay. Harassing an ex after a breakup can be a red flag, and threatening self-harm is serious. The author was trying to intervene to help both their friend and the ex. The author's message, while harsh, was pointing out the problematic behavior. The friend's reaction was to kick them out, which shows defensiveness. The friends agree with the content but suggest a nicer approach. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the content of the message was accurate\u2014his behavior is creepy and needs to stop. The method might have been harsh, but the intent was to help. The key here is that the author wasn't attacking their friend personally but addressing harmful behavior. The friend's actions were clearly problematic, so the author isn't wrong for calling it out. Even if the delivery could be softer, the substance is right. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
