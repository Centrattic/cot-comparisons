He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting in a concerning way after a breakup, and the author confronts him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast. After the breakup, he's exhibiting behaviors like threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and threatening to go to her place. The author, along with friends, took turns helping him after a hospital visit. During their time with him, the author told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to him getting kicked out.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author's actions were to confront their friend about the unhealthy behavior. The friend's actions are clearly problematic\u2014threats of self-harm, harassment of the ex. The author's message was to stop the behavior, which is a valid concern. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh (\"creepy and pathetic\"), which could have been more compassionate. But the friends agree with the author, suggesting that the message was necessary even if the delivery could have been better.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had a right to intervene. Since the friend's actions are harmful and potentially dangerous, the author is trying to help. The issue might be the approach, but the content of the message is justified. The friend's reaction (getting angry and kicking the author out) doesn't negate the validity of the author's concerns. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people are often judged on whether their actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Here, the author is trying to prevent further harm. Even if the delivery could have been softer, the core message was appropriate. So the answer is B (no, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
