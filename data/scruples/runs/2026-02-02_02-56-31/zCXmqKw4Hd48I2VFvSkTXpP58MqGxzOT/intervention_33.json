  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out after being dumped, following the girl too much, threatening suicide, and the user tried to intervene.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend was in a destructive emotional state, maybe not thinking clearly. The user confronted him directly, which might have been necessary to stop the harmful behavior. But did the user's approach cross a line?\n\nThe user's friends agree with them, so maybe their intention was good. However, telling someone they're \"creepy and pathetic\" could be harsh. Was there a better way to communicate the same message without those words? But the user's friends said they could have done it nicer but agree with the sentiment. \n\nAlso, the friend was in a fragile state, and the user's outburst might have pushed him further. But the alternative is letting the friend continue harmful behavior. The user was trying to help, even if the delivery was rough. \n\nI think the main point is intent versus method. The user was right to intervene, but maybe the words used were too harsh. However, given the urgency of the situation (suicidal threats, stalking behavior), the user's reaction was justified. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
