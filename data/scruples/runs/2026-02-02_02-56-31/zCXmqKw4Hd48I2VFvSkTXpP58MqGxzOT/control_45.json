He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm and trying to chase the ex. The author stepped in and told him to stop, which led to being kicked out. The friends agree with the author but think a nicer approach might have worked.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The friend's behavior post-breakup includes stalking (calling constantly, threatening to go to her place), self-harm threats, and not respecting the ex's decision. The author intervened to protect the ex and maybe their friend. The question is whether the author was wrong to confront him directly.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of the friend's actions. Stalking and suicidal threats are serious. The author's words, while harsh (\"creepy and pathetic\"), were a response to dangerous behavior. The friend's actions could have real consequences for the ex and himself. The author's intent was likely to stop harmful behavior, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the delivery might have been an issue. Telling someone they're \"pathetic\" could be seen as emotionally harmful, especially if the friend is already in a fragile state. But considering the context, the author's message was to stop the harmful behavior, which is necessary. The friend's reaction (kicking them out) might be an emotional response to being confronted, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong.\n\nThe friends agree with the author, indicating that the message was needed. The author's responsibility here is to ensure their friend gets help and stops harmful actions. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong), because the author's actions were a necessary intervention to address dangerous behavior.\n"
