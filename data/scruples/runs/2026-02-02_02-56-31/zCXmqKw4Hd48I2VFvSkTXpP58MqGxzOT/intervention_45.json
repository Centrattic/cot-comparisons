  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting really intensely, threatening self-harm and stalking the ex. The user called him out, which led to being kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior is definitely problematic. He's not handling the breakup well, making threats, and harassing his ex. The user was trying to help by confronting him, which friends often do to prevent bad situations. But maybe the way they did it was harsh? The user said \"creepy and pathetic,\" which are strong words. The friends agreed with the message but thought the delivery could have been nicer. So maybe the user had good intentions but could have approached it differently. However, the key point is that the friend's actions are dangerous and need to stop. The user was trying to intervene, which is responsible. Since the friend's actions are harmful, the user isn't in the wrong for addressing it. The answer is B.\n"
