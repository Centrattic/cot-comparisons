He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting really clingy and threatening after a breakup. The author told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship and had issues with anxiety. After the breakup, he's calling the ex and threatening harm to himself. He's also trying to pursue her again. The author steps in and confronts him directly, which leads to being kicked out. Friends agree with the author's message but think the delivery could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's actions (self-harm threats, stalking behavior) and the author's response. The author is concerned about their friend's well-being but also wants him to stop harassing the ex. The author's friends back them up but suggest a gentler approach.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, the friend might be violating restraining orders if there are any, but the story doesn't mention that. Ethically, the author is trying to help a friend who's in emotional distress. However, the friend's actions are problematic.\n\nThe author's direct approach caused conflict. But the content of the message (calling him creepy and pathetic) might be harsh. Maybe the author could have been more empathetic while still making the point. However, the friend's behavior is clearly unhealthy, so the author's intention was to help. \n\nIn situations like this, the line between helping a friend and being confrontational can be blurry. The author's friends agree with the message, so perhaps the message itself is valid. But the way it was delivered could have been smoother. However, the main issue is the friend's actions, not the author's response. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to help, even if the delivery was rough. So the answer is B.\n"
