He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The user's friend broke up with his girlfriend after she said he was moving too fast. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014calling 911 because he's threatening self-harm, then constantly contacting the ex, wanting to get her back, even considering showing up at her place.\n\nThe user stepped in and told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic, which led to the friend kicking them out. The user is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. He's showing signs of not respecting the breakup, which can be classified as stalking or harassing behavior. The user is trying to intervene to protect the friend's ex and perhaps help the friend get back on track. \n\nThe user's friends agree with the sentiment but think the approach could have been nicer. The key here is whether the user's message was appropriate in content and delivery. The user told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic. While the wording might have been harsh, the underlying message\u2014that the friend needs to stop contacting the ex\u2014is valid.\n\nThe user might have been well-intentioned but could have used a more supportive tone. However, the friend's actions are concerning, and the user is trying to address a real issue. In cases where someone's behavior is harmful, especially to others, pointing it out isn't necessarily wrong. The main issue is the friend's actions, not the user's response. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for speaking up, even if the delivery could have been improved. The answer is B.\n"
