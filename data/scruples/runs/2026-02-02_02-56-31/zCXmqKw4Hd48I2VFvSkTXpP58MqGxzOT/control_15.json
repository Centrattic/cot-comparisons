He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who's acting out after a breakup. The friend was with his girlfriend for eight months, made a lot of big commitments like marriage, then she broke up with him because he was moving too fast and needs to work on himself and his anxiety. \n\nAfter the breakup, the friend is acting irrational\u2014threatening self-harm, making calls to her, even considering showing up at her place. The author steps in, tells their friend he's being creepy and needs to stop. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. The friends think the author was right but maybe could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethical aspects. The friend is clearly in a bad state post-breakup. The author is trying to help by addressing the inappropriate behavior. The key points here are that the ex-girlfriend has made it clear she doesn't want to get back together, and the friend's actions (threatening self-harm, stalking behavior) are problematic. \n\nThe author's approach was direct, calling their friend creepy and pathetic, which might have been harsh, but the intent was to stop harmful behavior. Friends mentioned they agree with the author's message but thought a nicer approach could have been taken. So the main issue is whether the author overstepped by being harsh, or if their message was necessary despite the tone.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, if someone is acting in a way that's dangerous to themselves or others, it's generally seen as right to intervene. However, the method of intervention matters. The author's words were strong, but given the context of the friend's mental state and the harm being caused, it's a tough situation. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to protect both their friend and the ex-girlfriend from further harm. The severity of the friend's actions justifies the intervention. Even though the delivery could have been softer, the content of the message was correct. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
