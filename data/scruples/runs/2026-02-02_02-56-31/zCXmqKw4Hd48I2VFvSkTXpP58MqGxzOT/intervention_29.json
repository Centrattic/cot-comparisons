  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, got dumped, and is now acting out by threatening self-harm and trying to get back with the girl. The user stepped in and told their friend to stop, which caused a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend's behavior is definitely problematic. He's threatening self-harm, stalking the ex, and being persistent in a way that's clearly not wanted. The user and friends are trying to support him but also set boundaries. The user's outburst was because the friend kept talking about getting her back, which the user correctly points out is creepy and unwelcome.\n\nThe user's friends agree with the sentiment but think the approach could have been nicer. The user might have been harsh in their delivery, but the message was necessary. The friend was in a crisis, and the user was trying to help by stopping harmful behavior. The friend kicking them out is his reaction, but the user isn't wrong for standing up for the ex's wishes and their friend's well-being.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user is advocating for healthy behavior and respecting the ex's boundaries. Even if the delivery was rough, the intent was good. The friend's actions are clearly the issue here. So the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
