He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was pushing things too fast, which led to the breakup. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014calling 911 because he's threatening self-harm, constantly calling the ex, and wanting to confront her in person. The user, along with friends, has been trying to support him but during their turn, the user snapped and told him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight and him getting kicked out.\n\nThe user is worried about being in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's consider the context. The friend's behavior is definitely unhealthy\u2014stalking, repeated harassment, self-harm threats. The user's friends agree with their stance. The user was trying to intervene to stop the friend's harmful behavior. Even though the friend was in a vulnerable state, the user's comment was meant to help, not harm. The friend's reaction was to kick them out, but the user's message was about stopping something that's clearly wrong. The key points are whether the user overstepped or if they were justified in calling out dangerous behavior. Since the friend's actions are clearly harmful and the user was trying to help, I think the answer is B (no, not in the wrong). The user had a valid concern even if the delivery could have been better. The friends agreed, so it's a tough situation but the user isn't at fault.\n"
