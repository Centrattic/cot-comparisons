  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm and chasing after his ex. The user intervened and got kicked out. Their friends agree with them but think they could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend's behavior is definitely concerning\u2014he's moving too fast, then after the breakup, he's not respecting her boundaries, threatening self-harm, and stalking. The user is trying to help their friend by pointing out the creepy and pathetic behavior. But the friend didn't take it well.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they were trying to support their friend's well-being, even though the method might have been harsh. The key points here are that the user is addressing harmful behavior, which is necessary. The friend's actions are inappropriate, and the user is stepping in to help. Even if the approach could have been softer, the intent is good. The user isn't being malicious; they're trying to prevent further harm. So the answer should be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
