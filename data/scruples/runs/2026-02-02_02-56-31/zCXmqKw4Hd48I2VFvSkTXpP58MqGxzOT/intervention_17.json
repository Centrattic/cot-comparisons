  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and wanting to confront her. The user intervened by confronting their friend directly, which led to being kicked out.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. Threatening self-harm is a red flag, and stalking or harassing the ex is unhealthy. The user and friends were trying to support the friend during a crisis. But when the user snapped and called him creepy and pathetic, it might have come off as harsh, even if the message was valid.\n\nThe friends agreed with the message but thought the delivery could be softer. The user's approach might have been well-intentioned, but the way they said it could have been more compassionate. However, the core issue is that the friend needed to stop his obsessive behavior, and the user was trying to help. The friend's reaction (kicking them out) shows he wasn't ready to hear it, but that doesn't mean the user was wrong to speak up.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for pointing out the problematic behavior. The challenge was in the delivery, but the intent was to help. So the answer is B.\n"
