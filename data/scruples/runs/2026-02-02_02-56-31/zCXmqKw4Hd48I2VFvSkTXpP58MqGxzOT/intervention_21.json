  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm, contacting the ex constantly, and talking about showing up at her place. The user had to call 911 once because of the self-harm threats.\n\nThe user's friend was moving too fast in the relationship, and after the breakup, he's not handling it well. The user told him he's being creepy and pathetic, and the friend was angry and kicked them out. The user's friends agree with them but thought they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup, which includes stalking, threatening self-harm, and harassment. The user is trying to intervene to protect their friend and the ex. The user's actions were confrontational but with a good intention. The friends agree with the message but think the delivery could have been softer.\n\nThe user is not in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend who was in emotional distress and behaving dangerously. However, the way they delivered the message might have been harsh, but the core message was valid. The friend needed to be told to stop the harmful behavior. The user's friends support them, indicating that their actions were justified, even if the tone could be adjusted. So, the answer is B (No, you are not in the wrong).\n"
