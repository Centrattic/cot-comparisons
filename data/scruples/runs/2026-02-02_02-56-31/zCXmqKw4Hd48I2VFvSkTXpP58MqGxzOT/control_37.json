He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in an eight-month relationship where he was pushing for marriage, moving too fast. The girl broke up because he needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend was threatening self-harm, calls 911, and kept trying to contact the ex, even considering showing up at her place. The author, after being a supportive friend, finally snapped and told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's exhibiting obsessive and potentially dangerous behavior\u2014constant calls, threats of self-harm influenced by the ex's presence, and stalking-like actions. The author's intervention was to stop this, which friends agree with, though they suggest a nicer approach.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's actions are concerning and unhealthy. The author is trying to help by calling out the behavior, which is necessary to prevent further harm. While the delivery might not have been perfect, the intent was to stop harmful actions. The author isn't being cruel without reason; they're addressing real issues. So, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the friend's problematic behavior, even if the method could be improved.\n"
