He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was pushing for marriage and moving too fast, according to the girl. She broke up with him because he needs to work on himself and his anxiety. Then, after the breakup, the friend was so devastated that they had to call 911 because he was threatening suicide. He keeps calling the ex, threatening to confront her, which sounds obsessive. \n\nThe author, in their turn to help the friend, had enough and told him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to being kicked out. Friends agree with the author's message but thought a nicer approach might have been better. \n\nSo the main points: the friend's behavior is definitely problematic\u2014stalking, threatening self-harm, harassment. The author confronts him directly, which stops the harmful behavior. While the method might not have been the most tactful, the intent was to help. The friend's actions are dangerous for himself and could harm others. The author isn't wrong to point this out, even if there's a better way to communicate it. The key is that the behavior is wrong and needs to stop. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
