He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out by threatening self-harm, contacting the ex constantly, and planning to confront her in person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he moved too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's showing signs of emotional distress, like threatening self-harm and stalking behavior. The user intervened by telling their friend to stop, which led to conflict.\n\nThe user's actions were direct\u2014calling the friend's behavior creepy and pathetic. The friend then kicked them out. Friends told the user they agree but maybe a nicer approach was better. The user is wondering if they crossed a line.\n\nKey points to consider: The user's intent was to help, and they were trying to stop harmful behavior. The friend's actions (threatening self-harm, harassment) are concerning and potentially dangerous. The user's message, while harsh, might be necessary to prevent further issues. However, the delivery was confrontational, which might have been hurtful even if the message was right.\n\nBut in such situations, friends often need someone to set boundaries, especially when the person's actions are harmful. The user's friends agree with the message but suggested a nicer way. So the user might not be in the wrong for the content, but maybe the delivery could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong overall. Since the friend's behavior was problematic and the user tried to correct it, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, maybe the user should have been more supportive first. But given the circumstances, the user's intervention was necessary. So likely answer B.\n"
