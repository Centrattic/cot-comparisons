He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out post-breakup, making threats, trying to get his ex back, and the author intervened.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. He's contacting his ex repeatedly, threatening self-harm, and planning to confront her. This is all red flags. The author stepping in to stop this could be seen as appropriate because it's about safety and stopping harassment.\n\nThe author did it in a direct way, calling him out. While friends suggested a nicer approach, the content of the message is valid. The ex has made it clear she doesn't want to reconcile, so the friend is behaving inappropriately. The author's words might have been harsh, but the intent was to help, not harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend is in a vulnerable state, and the author's approach might not have been the most supportive. However, given the urgency of the situation (potential self-harm and harassment), the author's intervention is justified. The key points are the ex's clear boundaries and the dangerous behavior the friend was engaging in. The author isn't in the wrong because they were preventing further harm.\n"
