  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and didn't address his anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out by threatening self-harm, contacting the ex constantly, and threatening to confront her in person. The writer, after being part of the support group, finally tells their friend he's being inappropriate. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. The friends agree with the writer's message but think the delivery could have been better.\n\nI need to determine if the writer is in the wrong. The key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Harassment, threats of self-harm, and stalking-like behavior (intending to go to her place) are serious. The writer intervened to protect the ex and possibly help their friend. Even though the approach might have been harsh, the intent was to stop harmful behavior. The friends agree that the sentiment is right, even if the delivery could be improved. \n\nThe writer isn't in the wrong for pointing out their friend's harmful actions. The friend's actions are problematic, and the writer was trying to help. The answer is B.\n"
