He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was really upset after the breakup, had mental health issues, and was acting out by threatening self-harm and trying to win the girl back. The user spoke up, told their friend to stop, and got kicked out. Their friends agreed with them but said maybe the approach could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The friend is struggling with a breakup, which is emotionally intense. The user's friend was acting in ways that could be harmful\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking behavior, etc. The user intervened to protect both their friend and the ex-girlfriend. \n\nThe user's actions were direct and confrontational, calling their friend \"creepy and pathetic.\" That's pretty harsh language. But given the context, the user was trying to get through to a friend who was in a bad state. Mental health crises can be tricky because the person might not be thinking clearly. The user's intentions were good\u2014to stop their friend from causing more harm. \n\nOn the other hand, using such strong language might have alienated their friend further. Even if the message was correct, the delivery could have been more compassionate. The user's friends agree with the content but suggest a nicer approach. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong for the message, but the way they delivered it could be better. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the user did the right thing by telling their friend to stop. Since the friend's behavior was harmful and the user was trying to help, I think the user is in the right. They were looking out for their friend's well-being and the ex-girlfriend's safety. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong), but with a note that the delivery could have been softer.\n"
