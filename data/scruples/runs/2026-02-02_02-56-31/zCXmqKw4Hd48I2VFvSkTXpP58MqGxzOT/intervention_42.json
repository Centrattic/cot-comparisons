  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling a friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was emotionally unstable, had called 911, and kept trying to contact the ex, even threatening to go to her place. The user confronted him, leading to a fight and being kicked out.\n\nFirst, the user's friend is in a vulnerable state after a breakup. The ex wants no contact, but the friend isn't respecting that. The user's friends agree with the user's sentiment but think the delivery could have been better. The user's main action was calling him out directly with strong language like \"creepy\" and \"pathetic.\"\n\nIs the user right in being direct? Well, the friend's behavior is concerning and potentially harmful. The user is trying to intervene, which is good. But the approach might have been harsh. However, given the friend's mental state, maybe the user needed to be clear. The key is whether the user's intention was to help, which they were, but the method could have been softer. However, given the urgency of the situation (preventing harm to the friend or others), maybe being direct was necessary. Also, the friend kicked them out, but that's his choice. The user isn't in the wrong for standing up to prevent harmful behavior. So answer B.\n"
