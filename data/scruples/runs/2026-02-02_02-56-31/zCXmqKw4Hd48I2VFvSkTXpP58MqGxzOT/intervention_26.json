He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling their friend creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, got dumped because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex non-stop, and even threatening to go to her place. The user had to stay with him after a hospital visit and finally snapped, telling him he's being creepy and needs to stop. Now the friend is angry and kicked them out.\n\nFirst, the user's actions were meant to help their friend, right? The friend's behavior is clearly problematic and potentially dangerous. The user is trying to intervene before things escalate. They used strong language (\"creepy and pathetic\") which might not be the nicest way, but the intent was to get through to the friend. The friends agree with the message even if they think the delivery could have been softer. \n\nThe key points here are intent vs. method. The user's intent was constructive\u2014they wanted their friend to stop harmful behavior. The method was harsh, but the alternative might have been ineffective if not confrontational. The friend's actions were self-destructive and could lead to serious consequences. The user is trying to be a responsible friend here.\n\nHowever, the user's approach might have come off as harsh. Maybe a less direct approach could have been better, but given the urgency (threats of self-harm and stalking), the user's reaction seems justified. They\u2019re trying to prevent harm to both the friend and the ex. The friend's actions are not just about being clingy; there's a risk of self-harm and possible harm to others if he goes to her place. \n\nIn these situations, friends often have to step in when someone's mental health is declining. The user is acting in what they believe is the best interest. The friend's anger is a reaction to being challenged, but the user isn't in the wrong for trying to help. The friends support the user's message, so it's seen as necessary even if the delivery was rough. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn?url in the wrong. They were trying to help a friend who was in emotional distress and potentially dangerous behavior. The harsh words were a result of frustration after repeated attempts to get through to him. The answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
