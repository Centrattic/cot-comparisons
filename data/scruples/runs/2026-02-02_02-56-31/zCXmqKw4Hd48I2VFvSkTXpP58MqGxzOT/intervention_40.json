He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, which led to the breakup. After that, the friend is acting out by threatening self-harm, constantly calling the ex, and considering going to her place to ask for reconciliation. The user had to intervene and tell him to stop, which made the friend angry and kicked them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the user's actions were justified. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm is a serious issue and might require professional help. The user's friends agree with them, so maybe their approach was right in intent. However, the user admits they could have been nicer in their delivery. The key points here are the friend's well-being and safety. The user was trying to help, but the method might have been harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the friend needs to be stopped from making things worse for himself and the ex. On the other, the way the user communicated this might have been too confrontational. The friend was already in a fragile state, so a more compassionate approach could have been more effective. But the user's message was important: the friend was being inconsiderate and persistent despite clear rejections. \n\nI think the user is not in the wrong (B) because they were addressing harmful behavior, but they could have been more supportive while delivering the message. However, if the friend was truly in a mental health crisis, the priority should be to encourage professional help rather than just criticizing. The user's action was necessary but perhaps the tone could have been adjusted. So maybe the answer is B, but with a caveat about the method.\n"
