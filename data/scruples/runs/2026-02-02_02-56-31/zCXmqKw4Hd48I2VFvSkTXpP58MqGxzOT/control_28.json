He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong (AITA). \n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and hadn't managed his anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out by threatening self-harm, contacting the ex excessively, and threatening to confront her. The narrator and friends called 911, so there's a history of crisis intervention.\n\nThe narrator, after trying to support the friend, finally snaps and tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a confrontation. The friend kicks them out. The narrator's friends agree with the sentiment but think it could have been said nicer.\n\nNow, considering the context: the friend's behavior is clearly stalking/boundary-violating. The narrator's intervention is to point out reality, which is necessary for the friend's well-being and the ex's safety. Even though the delivery might have been harsh, the content is valid. The key here is that the friend was in a mental health crisis, but the narrator's actions were to stop harmful behavior. So, the narrator isn't wrong for calling out the behavior, even if the method could have been softer. The answer is B.\n"
