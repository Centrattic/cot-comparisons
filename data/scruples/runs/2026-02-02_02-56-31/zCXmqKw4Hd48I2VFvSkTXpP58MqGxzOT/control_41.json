He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, after trying to support their friend, finally tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author was wrong to speak up. The key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's engaging in stalking-like behavior (repeated calls, threatening to confront the ex), which is definitely inappropriate and could be dangerous. The author is concerned enough to confront him, which is a responsible action to prevent further escalation. \n\nThe author's friends agree with the sentiment but suggest a nicer approach. So the main debate here is about the method of confrontation rather than the message itself. The author's message is valid because the friend needs to stop his harmful behavior. However, the tone might have been harsh, but the intent was to help. \n\nIn terms of morality, if someone is in a dangerous emotional state and threatening self-harm or harassing someone, it's important to intervene. The author did step in, even if the delivery was harsh. The friend's actions are clearly the bigger issue here. The author's words, while maybe unkind, were meant to protect their friend from making a bad situation worse. \n\nAlso, the friend kicked the author out, which shows that the friend was defensive and possibly not ready to hear the truth. But that doesn't make the author wrong for speaking up. The responsibility lies with the friend to stop the harmful behavior, not the author for pointing it out. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They acted in what they believed was the right thing to do, even if the approach could have been softer. The main issue is the friend's actions, not the author's intervention.\n"
