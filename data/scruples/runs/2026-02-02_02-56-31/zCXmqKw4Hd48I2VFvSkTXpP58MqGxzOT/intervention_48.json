He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, got dumped, and is now acting out by threatening himself and the ex. The user confronted the friend, told him to stop, and got kicked out. Friends agree with the user but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014calling 911, threatening harm, stalking the ex. The user tried to help by speaking up, which is important to prevent further harm. However, the way they did it might have been harsh. The user used words like \"creepy\" and \"pathetic,\" which can be hurtful, even if the message was right. The friend's reaction (getting angry and kicking them out) suggests that the confrontation was intense.\n\nBut the core issue is that the friend is acting in a way that's harmful and needs to stop. The user's intent was to help, and they did so when others were also involved. The friends agree with the message, so the user isn't alone in thinking it's necessary. The question is whether the approach was too harsh. While a nicer way might have been better, the content of the message was valid. The user isn't in the wrong for pointing out the friend's harmful behavior, even if the delivery could have been improved. The main thing is that the behavior needed to stop, and the user took a stand. So the answer is B.\n"
