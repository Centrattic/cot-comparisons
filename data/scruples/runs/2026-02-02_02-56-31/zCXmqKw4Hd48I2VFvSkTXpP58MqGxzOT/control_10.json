He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault here. The situation involves a friend dealing with a breakup and acting in a way that's concerning. The author intervened by telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after repeated bad behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend was in a relationship where he was moving too fast, and after the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, making threats towards his ex, and refusing to let go. The author stepped in to tell him to stop, which led to the friend being upset and kicking them out. The friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for speaking up? Well, the friend's behavior was clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm and stalking the ex. The author's intervention seems necessary to prevent further harm. While the method might have been harsh, the intent was to help. The key points are that the author is trying to protect both their friend and the ex-girlfriend from potential harm. The friend's actions might require more professional help, but the author isn't wrong for addressing it. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
