He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. So, the friend was moving too fast in the relationship, and after the breakup, he's acting out by threatening self-harm, calling the ex, and wanting to confront her in person. The author tells him to stop, calls him creepy and pathetic, and gets kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions were appropriate. The friend is in a bad state emotionally, and the author is trying to help him. But the friend's actions are really concerning\u2014threatening self-harm is a big red flag. The author's friends agree with them, so maybe they weren't wrong. However, the way they said it might have been harsh, but the intent was to help. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's dangerous behavior and the author's attempt to intervene. Even if the delivery was rough, stopping someone from doing something harmful is usually justified. The author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to prevent further harm. The friend's actions are problematic, so the author had a valid reason to speak up. The answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
