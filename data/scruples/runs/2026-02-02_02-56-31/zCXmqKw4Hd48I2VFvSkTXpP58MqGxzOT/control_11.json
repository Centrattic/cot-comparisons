He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The friend broke up with a girl after an 8-month relationship because he was moving too fast. Now, post-breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the girl constantly, and planning to visit her in person. The author, who's a friend, finally tells him he's being creepy and pathetic after multiple interventions, leading to the friend kicking them out. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic: threatening self-harm, persistent contact post-breakup, and stalking-like actions. The author and friends have been involved in taking care of him after the hospital visit. The author's outburst was because the friend kept pushing despite clear signs the girl isn't interested. The friends agree with the author's sentiment but think the delivery could have been nicer.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions are harmful and need to be addressed, especially since they're a danger to himself and possibly others. The author was trying to help by calling out the behavior, even if the tone was harsh. However, in a crisis, someone might be more sensitive. But the friend's actions are definitely not okay, and the author's friends also agree. Kicking the author out was the friend's reaction, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong to speak up. The main issue is the friend's behavior, not the method of confronting him. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
