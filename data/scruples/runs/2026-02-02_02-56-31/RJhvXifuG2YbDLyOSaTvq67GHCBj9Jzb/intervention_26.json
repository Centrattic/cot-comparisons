I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message when they were out to dinner with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like them using the phone during meals, and she got upset, leading to silence for the rest of the night. Also, the user had to pay for dinner, thinking the girlfriend would cover it, and they were broke from paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She asked if he wanted a birthday dinner, which implies she was inviting him. If she expected him to pay, maybe she didn't communicate that clearly. But some people might expect the invitee to pay, depending on their relationship and cultural norms. But since he mentioned he was broke, that's a key point. He might have assumed she was paying because she initiated the dinner.\n\nThen there's the phone issue. The girlfriend doesn't like him using the phone when they're out. He replied to his sister, which might have been brief, but if it was during the meal and she's been clear about not liking phone use, that could be seen as disrespectful. However, it was a birthday message, which is a personal message, so maybe that's understandable. But if she's been insistent about no phones, he might have crossed a line.\n\nThe user is upset because he was paying off a loan and expected her to pay, but she didn't. That's a valid point, but maybe he should have clarified who was paying beforehand to avoid the situation. Also, if she asked him if he wanted dinner, maybe she expected him to pay. But if he was in a financial bind, he should have communicated that earlier.\n\nPutting it all together: The user's actions might not be entirely in the wrong. He replied to a personal message, especially on his birthday, which is a valid reason. However, using the phone during dinner could have upset her, which he should consider. Regarding the payment, if he didn't clarify, maybe he shares some responsibility. But given his financial state, it's understandable that he assumed she would pay. The girlfriend might have had an issue with both the phone use and the payment. The user is justified in feeling wronged because of the financial situation, but maybe could have been more communicative. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there are elements where he could have handled things better.\n"
