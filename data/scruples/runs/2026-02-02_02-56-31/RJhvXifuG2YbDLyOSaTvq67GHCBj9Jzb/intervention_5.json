Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during outings. After he responded, she wouldn't talk to him the rest of the night. He's also upset because he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it. He mentions that he just paid off a loan and emptied his savings, so he didn't expect to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main issue is whether replying to his sister's message was wrong. The girlfriend's aversion to phone use during their time together is a factor. Then there's the financial aspect where he assumed she was paying but ended up paying himself.\n\nSo, did he do something wrong? Well, if the girlfriend previously expressed that she doesn't like when he uses his phone during their outings, then responding to his sister's message might have been disrespectful to her feelings. Even if the message was a birthday wish, maybe he should have considered her preference. However, there's also the argument that birthday messages are personal, and it's reasonable to acknowledge them, especially from a family member.\n\nOn the other hand, the financial part adds another layer. He went out expecting her to pay, but since he had financial constraints, it's understandable he might be frustrated. But if he didn't communicate his financial situation beforehand, maybe he's partly responsible for the misunderstanding.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The main issue is the phone use. If the girlfriend had made it clear that she doesn't like his phone use during their time together, then he should have respected that. Even if it was a birthday message, maybe he could have handled it differently, like responding later or discreetly. As for the payment, if there was an assumption about who was paying, but he didn't clarify due to his financial situation, that's on him too. So, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundary and not setting clear expectations about the dinner payment.\n"
