Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for replying to their sister's birthday message while out to dinner with his girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out, and she got upset, didn't talk to him the rest of the night. He also thought she was paying for dinner, but she didn't, which added to his stress because he had to pay from his empty savings.\n\nFirst, the phone issue. The girlfriend had previously expressed that she doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. So, even if the sister's message was a surprise, the fact that she had communicated her preference before means he should have been aware. Replying to the message during dinner could be seen as disrespectful, especially since it led to her not talking to him for the rest of the night. That seems like a clear communication issue on his part.\n\nThen there's the dinner payment. He assumed she would pay, but she didn't. He mentions he had just paid off a loan and was tight on money. Assuming someone else will pay without confirming is a common mistake, but since the girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, maybe he should have clarified who was covering the cost, especially given his financial situation. However, in some relationships, it's common to split the bill or alternate, so without prior agreement, it's a bit of a gray area. But since he didn't mention the financial situation beforehand, maybe he should have communicated that he couldn't afford it.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issues are not respecting her phone policy and misunderstanding payment expectations. While both sides might have some responsibility, the user's actions directly led to her upset, especially the phone use. So, he's probably in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
