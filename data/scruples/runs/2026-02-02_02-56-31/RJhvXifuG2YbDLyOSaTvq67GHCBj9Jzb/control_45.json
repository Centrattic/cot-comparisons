Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message during dinner. His girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. After he replied, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Plus, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would, and he was already broke from paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend had previously expressed that she doesn't like it when he uses his phone during their outings. So, by replying to his sister, he's breaking a boundary she set. That's a point against him. Even if the sister sent a happy birthday message, which is a personal thing, he should've prioritized their time together as per her request. \n\nThen there's the financial aspect. He thought she would pay, but she didn't. He mentions he had to use his savings and checking to pay off a loan, so being broke is a factor. However, he didn't clarify expectations about splitting the bill beforehand. Maybe they had an unspoken agreement, but not discussing it could lead to misunderstandings. His anger about paying might be valid, but if he assumed she would pay without confirmation, that's partly on him.\n\nPutting it all together: The main issue is the phone use. He disregarded her boundaries, which led to her not talking to him. The money part is a separate issue but adds to his frustration. So, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) for the phone use. The financial part might be a contributing factor but doesn't excuse the main issue.\n"
