Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message when they were out to eat with their girlfriend. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister doesn't like the user using their phone during dinners. The user responded to the message, which upset the girlfriend. The girlfriend then didn't talk to the user the rest of the night. The user is still annoyed, had to pay for dinner, and thought the girlfriend would pay. Also, before going out, the girlfriend asked if they wanted to go out for dinner, and the user might not have considered that they'd have to pay because they're broke after paying off a loan.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about phone use during meals and financial expectations. The user's actions led to the girlfriend being upset, which is a big issue. The girlfriend's discomfort with phone use is mentioned upfront, so the user should have been aware. Even if the message was a birthday wish, checking the phone might have been seen as disrespectful. Also, the user didn't clarify who was paying, which led to an unexpected expense. \n\nBut wait, did the user have a right to check their phone for a birthday message? Maybe, but if the girlfriend had expressed discomfort before, the user should prioritize that. Financially, the user thought the girlfriend would pay, but since she didn't mention it, maybe the user should have asked. The user's frustration is valid because they were expecting to split or have the GF cover it, but not clarifying could be their fault. \n\nSo, combining both aspects: phone use and financial assumption. The user might be in the wrong for not respecting the GF's boundaries about phone use and not clarifying payment. The answer could be A. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the girlfriend's upset reaction was a direct result of the user's actions. So, the user is at fault. Answer A.\n"
