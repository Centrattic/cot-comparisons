Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (34M) is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message while on a date with his girlfriend (33F). The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone during dinners. After replying, she stopped talking to him for the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it. He mentioned he just paid off a loan and had no savings left.\n\nFirst, the phone use: The girlfriend has made it clear she doesn't like phone use during their time together. Replying to a message, even if it's a birthday wish, could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. Even if the message was unexpected, maybe he could have waited or let it go until after the dinner. Using the phone might have triggered her, leading to her silence the rest of the night. That seems like a breach of her boundaries.\n\nThen the dinner payment: He thought she would pay, but she didn't. Maybe they had an unspoken understanding or expectation. If she asked if he wanted to go out for his birthday dinner, perhaps the expectation was that she would cover it out of kindness. But if there was no prior agreement, it's a bit ambiguous. However, assuming someone will pay without confirmation can lead to misunderstandings. He might have known his financial situation and still went, which adds to the tension.\n\nCombined, the phone use during dinner and the assumption about payment could have led to her being upset. He's frustrated that he had to pay and that she didn't talk to him. But from her perspective, the phone use might have been a bigger issue. The question is whether his actions crossed a line. The phone use was a direct violation of her preference, which could justify her reaction. The payment issue might be a secondary point but could contribute to her being upset. So, he might be in the wrong for using the phone despite knowing her preference, even if he had reasons for being stressed about finances.\n"
