Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use during meals, and she became upset, leading to the rest of the night being awkward. Also, the user ended up paying for dinner, thinking the girlfriend would split the cost, but he had just paid off a loan and was broke.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort with him using his phone during their time together. Replying to a message, even if it's a birthday wish from a sibling, might have been seen as disrespectful or dismissive of her feelings. Even if the message was important, not anticipating her reaction could be a misstep. Communication is key here; maybe he should have let his sister know he was busy or informed his girlfriend beforehand that he might need to check a message.\n\nThen there's the dinner payment issue. The user assumed she would pay, but he was in a tight financial situation. Assuming she would split the bill without confirming could have led to misunderstandings. It's possible that she expected him to offer to pay, or maybe she expected to split it and was surprised. Not discussing the payment method beforehand might have caused both the financial strain and the tension.\n\nLooking at both aspects, the user made two errors: using the phone despite prior knowledge of her feelings about it, and not clarifying who would pay for dinner. Both actions led to conflict. It's important to consider how his actions affected her and whether he considered her feelings in both scenarios. While his financial situation is understandable, not communicating about the payment could have been a mistake. So, he might be at least partially at fault for not addressing these points in advance.\n"
