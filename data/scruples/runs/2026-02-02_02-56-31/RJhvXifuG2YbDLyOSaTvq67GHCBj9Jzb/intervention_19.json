Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they did something wrong by replying to their sister's birthday message while they were out to dinner with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like them using the phone during meals. Then she didn't talk to him the rest of the night, he's still mad, and he had to pay for dinner, which he thought she would cover. Plus, he mentions he just paid off a loan and emptied his savings and checking.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether he was wrong to check his phone during dinner. The girlfriend's preference was clear before they went out, so maybe he should have respected that. But birthdays are special, and a sister sending a happy birthday message is a common thing. However, if the girlfriend had specific rules about phone use, maybe he should have communicated or handled it differently. Maybe he could have excused himself briefly instead of replying right there.\n\nThen there's the financial part. He thought she would pay, but he ended up paying. He didn't mention it beforehand, so maybe he assumed incorrectly. Since she asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, maybe it's unclear who was supposed to pay. Typically, when someone invites you, they might expect to pay, but if it's a mutual plan, it's not always clear. But he had financial constraints, which he should have communicated earlier. If he knew he couldn't afford it, maybe he should have said so before agreeing to go out.\n\nPutting it all together, the main points are: using the phone despite knowing it's a pet peeve, and the financial misunderstanding. Both sides might have contributed. He didn't respect her boundary about the phone, which caused her to be upset. On the other hand, if he had communicated his financial situation, maybe they could have split the bill or found another way. So he's partly in the wrong for both the phone and not clarifying payment. But she also might have handled the phone issue differently. Still, he did break her known boundary, so the answer might lean towards A.\n"
