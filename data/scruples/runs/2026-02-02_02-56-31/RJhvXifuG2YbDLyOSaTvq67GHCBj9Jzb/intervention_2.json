I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use during meals, and she became upset, not talking the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it, and he's in a tight financial spot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's action was checking his phone to respond to a birthday message. It's common for people to feel annoyed when someone uses their phone during a meal, as it can be seen as disrespectful or a distraction. The girlfriend might have felt ignored or that her preferences weren't respected. So, in that aspect, the user might have overstepped.\n\nOn the other hand, the user mentions he wouldn't have gone out if he knew he had to pay, especially since he was broke after paying off a loan. That shows he might have been under financial stress, but he didn't clarify the payment arrangement beforehand. That could be a point where communication was lacking. However, splitting the bill or discussing payment before the meal is usually a good idea to avoid such situations.\n\nThe sister's message was a birthday greeting, which is a personal and important message. Responding briefly might not be unreasonable, but if it's a repeated issue, it could be a point of contention. The key here is the girlfriend's feelings about phone use. If she's communicated that she doesn't like it and he's aware, then not respecting that boundary could be on him.\n\nFinancially, the user's assumption that the girlfriend would pay might not be fair. It's better to clarify who's paying beforehand, especially in a relationship where finances can be a sensitive topic. Not discussing this upfront led to an awkward situation where he ended up paying when he couldn't afford it.\n\nSo, putting it all together: He didn't respect her boundary by using his phone, leading to her becoming upset. Also, not discussing payment beforehand caused financial stress. Both actions contributed to the problem. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong (Option A). But maybe there's a nuance where the sister's message was a valid reason. However, since the girlfriend's preference is to not use phones during meals, the user should have prioritized her feelings. So, AITA answer would be A.\n"
