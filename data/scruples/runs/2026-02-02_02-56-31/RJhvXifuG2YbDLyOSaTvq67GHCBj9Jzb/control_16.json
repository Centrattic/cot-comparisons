Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with their girlfriend. The key points here are:\n\n1. **Phone Use During Dinner**: The girlfriend doesn't like it when he uses his phone during meals. He replied to his sister's message, which upset her. That's a direct conflict. Even if the message was well-intended, the girlfriend's feelings about phone use during meals are a valid concern. He should probably have prioritized her comfort, given their shared time.\n\n2. **Financial Misunderstanding**: The user assumed his girlfriend was paying for dinner, but she ended up paying. He had just paid off a loan and emptied his accounts, so this was a financial strain. He felt it was a setup since she asked if he wanted to go out for a birthday dinner. However, the way he interpreted her question as a setup might be a stretch. She might have genuinely invited him, not expecting him to pay. The assumption that she would pay could be a miscommunication, but he should have clarified the payment details to avoid the situation.\n\n3. **Aftermath**: The girlfriend didn't talk to him the rest of the night. He's still upset about the financial part and the situation where he paid. His frustration is understandable, but the main issue is the phone use and the financial assumption. He might have overstepped by using his phone, which is a social faux pas in many relationships, especially if the girlfriend has expressed discomfort with it before.\n\n4. **Context of the Relationship**: The user and his girlfriend are in a committed relationship, so shared expectations and communication are key. If he knew she disliked phone use, replying to the message was a mistake. The financial part is a miscommunication, but not necessarily his fault if he genuinely assumed she would pay, though he should have checked that.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the phone use is a clear issue. Even if the message was important (birthday wish from a sister), the girlfriend's priority of not using phones during meals is a boundary he crossed. The financial part is more of a misunderstanding but still a point where clearer communication was needed. So, the main fault is with the phone use, making the user at least partially in the wrong. However, the financial assumption complicates it. But overall, the phone use during their dinner is the primary issue here.\n"
