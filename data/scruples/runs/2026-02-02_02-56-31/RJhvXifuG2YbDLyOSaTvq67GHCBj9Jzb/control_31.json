      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person (34M) and his girlfriend (33F) went out to eat for his birthday. His sister messaged him \"Happy Birthday,\" and he replied. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. After that, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. He's upset because he thought she was paying for dinner but had to pay himself, which he's struggling with financially. He also mentions that before going out, the girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for a birthday dinner, and he agreed without knowing he'd have to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault here. Let's break it down. The main points are:\n\n1. Replying to his sister's birthday message: The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone during their time together. The author felt he was just responding to a well-wisher, which is a common courtesy. But the girlfriend was upset about it, leading to her not talking to him the rest of the night. Is that a valid reason for her to be upset? Well, if the girlfriend had previously expressed that she doesn't want him to use his phone when they're out, then the author should be aware of that boundary. If he didn't know, maybe it's a communication issue. But if he did know and still replied, that's a problem. The post says \"She doesn't like when I use my phone,\" implying it's a known issue. So replying to the message might have been a mistake here.\n\n2. Paying for dinner: The author assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she didn't. He ended up paying, which he can't afford because he just paid off a loan. He found out the cost was too high for him. The question is whether he's in the wrong for assuming she would pay. The girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for the dinner, and he agreed without knowing he'd have to pay. If the expectation in their relationship is that they split or take turns, or if the girlfriend offered to pay but he didn't clarify, then maybe the author should have communicated his financial situation. However, if he thought it was her idea (birthday dinner, maybe expecting her to cover it), but she didn't, that's on her. But the author didn't mention discussing payment beforehand. Maybe he should have asked if she was paying before agreeing to go out, especially since he was in a tight financial spot.\n\n3. Financial situation: He emptied his savings and checking to pay off a loan, so the dinner being expensive caused him to have to pay out of pocket. If he knew he couldn't afford it, maybe he shouldn't have agreed to go out without clarifying the payment. But the girlfriend invited him, so he might have assumed it was a gesture from her. However, not talking about money expectations can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nPutting it all together: The author might be partially at fault. Replying to the sister's message when the girlfriend knows he shouldn't use his phone during their time together could be seen as disregarding her feelings. Also, not clarifying who would pay for dinner, given his financial situation, could be his oversight. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction to the phone use and not paying for dinner as expected might be her faults as well. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on how much he should have known about the boundaries and whether he was aware of the financial expectations. If he knew about the phone issue and ignored it, that's his fault. If he didn't clarify the payment, that's also on him. So maybe the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong), but the situation is a bit of a mutual misunderstanding. However, since the question is a yes/no, and he did two things that could be his fault (using the phone against her wishes and not clarifying payment), the answer might lean towards A.\n"
