Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author replied to their sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during meals. After that, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Plus, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would, and he was stressed because he just paid off a loan and had no money left.\n\nFirst, the main issues here are the phone use and the payment expectation. The girlfriend had previously asked if he wanted to go out for his birthday dinner. If she asked, maybe she intended to split the cost or he assumed she would pay. But he had no money left and was upset about paying. \n\nNow, the phone use during dinner is a common relationship issue. Many people find it rude to check phones when on dates, especially if the partner has expressed discomfort with it before. The author's action might have triggered her not talking to him for the rest of the night. That's a big sign of being in the wrong here because he prioritized replying to his sister over their time together.\n\nThen there's the payment part. He thought she would pay, but she didn't. Maybe she expected him to pay? Or maybe she expected to split it? Since he had no money, this could add to the tension. But if he agreed to go out knowing he had no funds, maybe he should have communicated that better. However, the main issue seems to be the phone use. \n\nPutting it all together: the author's decision to use his phone during dinner likely hurt his girlfriend's feelings, leading to her silence. Also, the payment issue might be a separate problem, but the phone use is more about respect during their time together. So, the author is probably in the wrong for both not respecting her preference about phone use and possibly not being clear about the payment arrangement. But the main point is the phone use. So the answer is A.\n"
