Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while out to dinner with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use during meals, which caused her to stop talking the rest of the night. Also, the author had to pay for dinner, thinking the girlfriend would cover it, and he's financially strained from paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend expressed her dislike for phone use during dates, so replying to the sister might have been a breach of that boundary. Even if the birthday message was important, not considering her feelings here could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThen there's the financial part. The author assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she didn't. Maybe he should have clarified who was paying beforehand, especially since he's in a tight financial spot. Assuming without confirming might have led to an awkward situation where he had to pay unexpectedly.\n\nBut looking at the sister's message: it was a simple \"Happy Birthday.\" The author might have felt obligated to respond, but maybe there's a way to handle it without using the phone during dinner. Alternatively, maybe he could have told the sister to wait or explained the situation. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of not talking for the rest of the night seems harsh, but the author's actions might have triggered that. Also, the financial assumption could have been a point of contention. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author should have respected the girlfriend's boundary about phone use, and maybe clarified payment arrangements beforehand. The sister's message was a minor thing, but the context of the date and the girlfriend's preferences matters more. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing those issues proactively.\n"
