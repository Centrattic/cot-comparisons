Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they were wrong to reply to their sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with his girlfriend. The key points here are the context of their relationship, the girlfriend's feelings about phone use during dates, and the financial situation.\n\nFirst, the user's girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during their time together. That's a clear boundary she's set. He checked his phone to respond to his sister, which she found disrespectful. That seems like a breach of her boundaries. Even though it was a birthday message, not using the phone would have been more considerate towards her feelings.\n\nThen there's the issue of paying for dinner. The user thought she was paying, but she ended up not talking to him the rest of the night. The fact that he had just paid off a loan and emptied his accounts might add some stress, but the main issue here is the assumption about payment. If he didn't clarify beforehand who would pay, that's on him. Maybe he should have asked more clearly or communicated his financial situation before the dinner.\n\nAlso, the sister asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, implying she was planning to pay. If he knew his financial state, he should have mentioned it upfront to avoid the situation. Not doing so could be seen as inconsiderate towards her as well, but the main conflict here is with the girlfriend.\n\nSo, combining both issues: using the phone against her wishes and not clarifying the payment. The first is a direct violation of her boundary, and the second is a miscommunication. The girlfriend's reaction of not talking to him might be an overreaction, but the root causes are his actions. Therefore, he's at least partially at fault.\n"
