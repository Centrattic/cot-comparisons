Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message during dinner with their girlfriend. The key points here are:\n\n1. The girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during dinners. He replied to his sister, which upset her.\n2. After that, she didn't talk to him for the rest of the night.\n3. He also had to pay for dinner because he thought she was paying, but he was in a financial bind.\n\nFirst, the phone use. If the girlfriend has previously communicated that she doesn't like him using his phone during meals, then replying to the message could be seen as disregarding her feelings. Relationships often require mutual respect of each other's boundaries. So, if he knew her preference, he might be at fault here.\n\nThen, the payment issue. The author assumed the girlfriend would pay, but he was in a situation where he couldn't afford it. However, he should have clarified the payment arrangement beforehand to avoid misunderstanding. Assuming someone else will pay when you're in a tight financial spot is risky. Maybe he should have communicated that he couldn't afford it, but he went along anyway when he knew he had to cover it.\n\nAlso, the sister's message was about his birthday. It's a personal occasion, so there's some justification for replying, but it depends on the context. If the girlfriend had no issue with him using the phone otherwise, maybe it's a smaller issue. But if this has happened before, it's a bigger problem.\n\nPutting it all together, the author's actions led to his girlfriend being upset. Even if his intentions were understandable (replying to a birthday message from a family member), not considering her feelings about phone use during meals could be seen as his fault. Additionally, not clarifying payment expectations shows poor communication. So, he might be in the wrong here.\n"
