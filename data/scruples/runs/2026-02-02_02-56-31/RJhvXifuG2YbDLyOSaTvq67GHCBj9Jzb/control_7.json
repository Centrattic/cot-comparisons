Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the main issue is that the author replied to his sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with his girlfriend, who doesn't like him using his phone during meals. The girlfriend got upset and didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, the author ended up paying for dinner, thinking she would cover it, and he's tight on money because he just paid off a loan.\n\nSo, the first point is about using the phone. The girlfriend has made it clear she doesn't like that, and the author did it anyway. That's probably a point where he's in the wrong because he disregarded her preference. Even though birthdays are important, there's a balance between being polite to family and respecting your partner's boundaries.\n\nThen there's the part about the dinner payment. The author assumed she was paying, but she ended up not contributing. This could be a misunderstanding. The girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, which might imply it's a joint expense, but maybe she expected him to pay. If he had known he'd have to pay, he wouldn't have gone because he's broke. That's a financial issue, but maybe he should have confirmed who's paying beforehand instead of assuming.\n\nThe user is upset about both issues. The girlfriend's reaction might have been partly because of the phone use, which led to her being upset the whole night. However, the financial part adds to the frustration. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for both or either. \n\nIf the girlfriend specifically told him not to use the phone, then he definitely violated her rules. But if she didn't make it clear, maybe there's some ambiguity. The main thing is that the girlfriend's feelings were hurt, so regardless of the phone use, his action had a negative impact. Also, not clarifying the payment responsibility might have led to his financial stress, but that's more about communication.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author did something his girlfriend disliked (using the phone) and then had an unclarified payment situation. The phone use seems like a clear mistake. The financial part is more about communication, but since he assumed she was paying and she didn't mention it, maybe both sides share some responsibility. However, the main issue is the phone use leading to her upset. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her boundary about phone use during meals, which directly caused her to be upset.\n"
