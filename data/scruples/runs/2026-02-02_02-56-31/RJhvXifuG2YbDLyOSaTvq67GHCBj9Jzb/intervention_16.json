Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. After he replied, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. He's also upset because he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would, and he was broke after paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend expressed that she doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. He replied to his sister's message during dinner, which probably made her feel ignored or disrespected. Even if it was a birthday message, using the phone in a situation where the partner has made it clear they don't like it could be seen as dismissive. That's a key point.\n\nThen, the financial aspect. She asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, and he assumed she would pay. But he didn't clarify, and now he's upset because he had to pay when he was already broke. But maybe the bigger issue here is the phone use leading to the argument. The dinner payment might be a separate point, but the girlfriend's reaction was more about the phone use. He's angry she didn't talk to him after, which suggests that the phone use was the main trigger.\n\nHe might feel wronged because he thought the dinner was a birthday dinner, but the sister's message was also a birthday one. However, the priority in a date night is usually giving attention to the partner. The girlfriend's discomfort with phone use isn't unreasonable. So, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries.\n\nAlso, assuming she would pay without confirming isn't his best move. But the main issue is the phone use. So, AITA? It's a mix, but the phone use is a significant factor. He might be in the wrong for not heeding her previous requests about phone use, leading to her silent treatment. The financial part adds to his stress but might not be the main fault.\n"
