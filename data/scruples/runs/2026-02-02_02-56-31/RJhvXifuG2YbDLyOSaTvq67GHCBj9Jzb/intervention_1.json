Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while out to dinner with his girlfriend. The sister doesn't like him using his phone when they're out, and she was upset about that. The girlfriend also didn't talk to him the rest of the night. He's still upset because he had to pay for dinner, assumed she would, and mentions he was broke from paying off a loan. \n\nFirst, the main conflict seems to be about phone use during dinner. The sister had previously mentioned not liking it when he uses his phone, so replying to her message might have been a point of contention. But the user is angry because he thought the girlfriend was paying, but ended up paying himself, which added to his stress.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The sister's perspective: she might feel disrespected by his phone use, which is a common issue in relationships. The user's perspective: he was checking a birthday message, which is a social norm, but the sister's preference was already communicated. Then there's the financial aspect\u2014assuming the girlfriend would pay, but not discussing it beforehand led to a problem. \n\nIs he in the wrong? On the phone use, if the sister had told him before not to use the phone, then responding might be a breach of that agreement. However, the birthday message is a valid communication need. But maybe the timing or the way he used the phone was an issue. Also, the financial assumption might have caused more hurt. If he didn't have money, maybe he should have communicated that before the dinner. So, both sides might have valid points. The sister's upset might be about the phone use, but the user's side about the financial part. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since both issues contributed to the conflict, maybe he shares some responsibility. So, the answer might be Yes (A).\n"
