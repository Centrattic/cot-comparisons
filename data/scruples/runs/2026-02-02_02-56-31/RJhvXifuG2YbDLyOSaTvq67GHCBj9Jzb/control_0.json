Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with their girlfriend. The sister doesn't like the author using his phone during meals. After the message, the girlfriend didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, the author had to pay for dinner, thinking the girlfriend would cover it, and he was in a tight financial situation.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend has made it clear that she doesn't like the author using his phone when they're out. Replying to a birthday message might seem minor, but if it's against her preferences and caused her to withdraw for the rest of the night, that's a problem. The author should have respected her boundaries here.\n\nNext, the financial part. The author assumed the girlfriend would pay, but he ended up covering the cost. This led to his frustration, especially since he had just spent his savings. However, assuming someone will pay without discussing it beforehand is a common issue in relationships. Clear communication about splitting costs would prevent such misunderstandings.\n\nPutting it all together, the author's actions (using the phone despite the girlfriend's preferences) directly led to the girlfriend's withdrawal. The financial issue adds to the tension but might be a separate point. The key here is respecting the girlfriend's boundaries. By not adhering to her wishes about phone use, the author is in the wrong. The financial aspect is a separate issue but contributes to the overall conflict. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
