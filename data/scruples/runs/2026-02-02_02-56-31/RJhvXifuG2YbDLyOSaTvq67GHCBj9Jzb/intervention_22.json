Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he got a birthday message from his sister while he and his girlfriend were out to eat. He replied to her message, but his girlfriend doesn't like it when he uses his phone during their time together. After that, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. He's upset because he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it, and he's already spent his savings to pay off a loan. Before going out, she asked if they wanted to go out for a birthday dinner.\n\nFirst, looking at the sister's message. It's a simple \"Happy Birthday,\" which is a common thing to send. Replying to that might seem natural, but the girlfriend's rule is no phone use during dinners. The user's reply could have been seen as a breach of that agreement. However, birthday messages can be special, so maybe he thought it was okay. The key here is whether he respected her boundaries. If she had already communicated that she doesn't like phone use during their time together, then replying might have been inconsiderate, even if it's a birthday message.\n\nThen there's the issue of paying for dinner. He thought she would pay, but she didn't, leading to him being upset. The girlfriend's question before they went out was about having dinner, but it's unclear if she explicitly said she would pay. If he assumed she would pay based on that question, but she didn't, then he might be misreading her intentions. However, in some cultures or relationships, the person making the arrangement might expect the other to pay, but this can vary. Since he had financial constraints, not having the money to pay could be a valid stress point, but if he assumed she would cover it, then he might have been wrong in that assumption.\n\nPutting it together, the main points are: 1) Using the phone during dinner despite her disapproval, 2) Not clarifying who would pay for dinner. The user's actions in both cases might have led to the girlfriend's upset. So, he might be in the wrong for both instances, especially if he didn't consider her boundaries and expectations.\n"
