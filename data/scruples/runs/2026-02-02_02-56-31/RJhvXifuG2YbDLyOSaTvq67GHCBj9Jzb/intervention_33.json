I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message during dinner with his girlfriend. He says his girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone when they're out. She then didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner even though he thought she would, and he was in a financial tight spot.\n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be about phone use during dinner. The girlfriend expressed a dislike for phone use, so using it might have been disrespectful or a breach of unspoken rules. That could be his fault. Then, there's the part about splitting the bill. If he thought she was paying but she expected him to, that's a miscommunication. He mentions he emptied his savings, so maybe he's stressed about money, but he still went out assuming she'd pay. \n\nBut there are two sides. The girlfriend's reaction to his phone use might be over the top. Maybe she was already upset about the bill? Or maybe she felt disrespected by the phone use, leading to her silence. Also, the sister's message was a birthday greeting, which he might have felt compelled to respond to. \n\nSo, the user is in a tricky spot. He might be in the wrong for using his phone despite knowing her preference. But the girlfriend's reaction and the financial situation add context. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points are: using the phone when she didn't want him to, leading to her not talking to him, and miscommunication about splitting the bill. \n\nI think he's partially at fault for using the phone, but maybe the girlfriend's response was also excessive. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes) because he did use the phone despite her preference, causing conflict. The financial part is a separate issue but contributes to the tension. So overall, AITA? Probably A.\n"
