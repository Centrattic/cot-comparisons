I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the sister messaged \"Happy Birthday\" during their dinner. The girlfriend already mentioned she doesn't like it when he uses his phone during meals. So the author replied to his sister, which upset the girlfriend, leading her to not talk to him the rest of the night. That seems like a clear point where he didn't consider her feelings.\n\nThen there's the payment issue. He assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she ended up not paying. He had to pay out of his own pocket after emptying savings and checking to pay off a loan. Also, before going out, the girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, implying maybe she thought he wanted to celebrate his birthday. But he didn't mention his financial situation then.\n\nSo, the author's actions in replying to his sister during dinner might have been disrespectful to his girlfriend's boundaries. Also, the assumption about payment shows a lack of communication about their financial expectations. He didn't clarify payment upfront, which could have avoided the conflict. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's response to his message was harsh. But the main question is about the author's wrong. The key points are: not respecting her phone use boundaries and not communicating about payment. So he's at fault here. Answer A.\n"
