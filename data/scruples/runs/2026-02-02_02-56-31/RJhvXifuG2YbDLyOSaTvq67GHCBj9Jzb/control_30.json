Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The author's sister messaged \"Happy Birthday\" while they were out to eat with their girlfriend. The author replied, which upset the girlfriend because she doesn't like phone use during dates. Then the girlfriend didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, the author had to pay for dinner, thinking the girlfriend would pay. The girlfriend had asked if he wanted to go out for a birthday dinner, and he went without knowing he'd have to pay, which is an issue because he just paid off a loan and emptied his accounts.\n\nFirst, the phone use: the girlfriend didn't like it when he used his phone. The author's sister's message was a birthday greeting, so replying might be seen as polite. But if the girlfriend had previously expressed disapproval of phone use during meals, the author might have known to avoid it. However, the sister's message could also be timely, so replying quickly might be expected. It's a bit of a gray area here.\n\nThen, the payment issue. The girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for his birthday dinner. If she asked, maybe she intended to pay, but maybe not. The author assumed she would pay, but since he ended up paying, that's a point of contention. The girlfriend might have expected him to cover it, especially if it's his birthday. But the author's financial situation complicates things\u2014he had just paid off a loan and had no money left. That's a valid reason for him to be upset about paying.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for using the phone during dinner if the girlfriend had made it clear it's important to her. On the other hand, replying to a birthday message could be seen as appropriate. The payment issue is more about assumptions. The girlfriend might have thought he'd pay, but the author thought she would. Both could be at fault here. However, the author's financial situation is a mitigating factor. \n\nConsidering all that, the main issue is the phone use. If the girlfriend doesn't like it, the author should have avoided replying. The payment issue is a mutual assumption problem. Since the phone use led to the girlfriend being upset, the author is probably in the wrong there. So the answer would be A (Yes). But wait, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is also over the top. However, the question is about the author's wrongness. If he knew her feelings about phones, replying was a mistake. So A is correct.\n"
