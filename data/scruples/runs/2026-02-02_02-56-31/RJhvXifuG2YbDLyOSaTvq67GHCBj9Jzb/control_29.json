Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the man replying to his sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with his girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during their meals. After he replied, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner because he assumed she would, but he was in a tight financial spot.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about phone use during dinner. The girlfriend had expressed her dislike for him using his phone when they're out. So, by replying to his sister, he might have violated her boundaries. Even if the sister sent a birthday message, she might have expected him to wait until they were done or handle it another way. The girlfriend's reaction of not talking for the rest of the night suggests that this was a significant issue for her.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The man assumed she would pay, but he had just emptied his accounts to pay off a loan. If she expected him to pay, that's a problem. But if he thought she would cover it, then maybe there was a miscommunication. However, the key here is the assumption. If he went into the dinner expecting her to pay but she expected him to, that's a mutual misunderstanding. However, the main issue might be the phone use, which directly caused her to be upset during their time together.\n\nThe sister's message was a birthday greeting, which is a reasonable thing to respond to. But the context was that they were out to eat, and the girlfriend had previously communicated her dislike for phone use during their meals. The man's response to the sister could be seen as dismissive of his girlfriend's preferences. Even if it was a simple reply, the act of taking out the phone might have been a trigger for her.\n\nFinancially, the situation is a bit more nuanced. He assumed she would pay, but he was in a bad financial state. If she expected him to pay, that's a valid point. However, the primary conflict seems to be the phone use, which led to the girlfriend's upset. The fact that he had to pay might add to his frustration, but the main wrong here is likely the phone use, which disregarded her boundaries.\n\nSo, considering both aspects, the man did ignore his girlfriend's prior communication about phone use, leading to her being upset. Therefore, he might be in the wrong regarding the phone use. The financial part is a separate issue but doesn't exonerate him from the main problem.\n"
