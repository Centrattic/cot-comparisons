Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The main points are: he replied to his sister's birthday message while on a date with his girlfriend, which upset her because she doesn't like phone use during meals. Then, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, assuming she would pay, but he was broke after paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the phone use. The girlfriend had previously mentioned she doesn't like him using his phone during their time together. Replying to a message, even a birthday wish, might be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate. But maybe it was a quick reply? The sister's message was a simple \"Happy Birthday,\" so perhaps a quick response isn't too bad. But if the GF has a rule about phones, he should respect that. So maybe he's in the wrong here.\n\nSecond, the dinner payment. He assumed she would pay because she asked if he wanted to go out for dinner. But if he thought he was paying, maybe he should have clarified earlier. However, he mentions he was broke and didn't want to go out if he had to pay. It's possible he didn't communicate his financial situation, leading to an assumption that might not have been correct. So he might be wrong for not setting clear expectations about payment.\n\nAlso, his sister's message was on his birthday, so maybe it's understandable to respond, but again, if the GF has a rule, he should prioritize her comfort. The fact that the GF was upset and didn't talk to him the rest of the night might indicate that he crossed a boundary.\n\nPutting it all together: He might be at fault for using his phone despite her preference and not clarifying payment. But also, maybe the GF overreacted, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. So A (Yes, he's in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
