I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Target employee who detailed the graphic content of GTA V to a mother buying a game for her 9-year-old son. The mother ended up not purchasing it, and the co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The employee was providing information about the game's content, which includes mature themes like violence, sex, and swearing. The mother asked for more details, and the employee gave an honest account. The employee's intention was to inform, not to push a product or deceive. The mother made the decision based on that information, which seems reasonable.\n\nNow, the co-worker's reaction is that the employee was being a \"dick\" by stopping the sale. However, the employee's role is to provide accurate information so customers can make informed decisions. It's part of good customer service to explain product details, especially when content might be inappropriate for certain age groups. The employee isn't forcing the sale; they're sharing facts. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, the mother wanted to know what the game contains before making a purchase for her young child. The employee's actions align with helping parents make responsible decisions. There's no indication that the employee was rude or disrespectful; they were professional and provided necessary information. \n\nThe key points here are the employee's duty to inform, the mother's right to know about content for her child, and the co-worker's misunderstanding of the employee's role. The employee isn't in the wrong because they were acting in the customer's best interest by providing transparency. The co-worker's criticism seems misplaced, as the employee did their job correctly.\n"
