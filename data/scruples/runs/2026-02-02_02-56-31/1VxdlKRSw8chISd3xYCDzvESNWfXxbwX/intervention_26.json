I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they did the wrong thing by telling a mother about the graphic content in GTA V to prevent her from buying it for her 9-year-old. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the user works in a store and is helping a customer. The customer's son is 9, and she wants GTA V. The user explains the M rating and the game's violent and sexual content. The mother then decides against buying it. The coworker is upset because they felt the user was being too harsh, but the user's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content.\n\nI need to consider the age of the child. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences, typically 17+. A 9-year-old is way under that age. Retailers have a responsibility to inform customers about content ratings, especially when it comes to minors. The user provided accurate information about the game's content, which is their job to do. The mother was seeking more info, and the user gave it honestly. \n\nThe coworker's issue seems to be with the user's approach. But the user's goal was to help the mother make an informed decision. Parental responsibility comes into play here. Parents should be aware of what their kids are playing, and the user helped them avoid a game unsuitable for a child. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the store's policy. Retail stores often have guidelines about not selling M-rated games to minors. By informing the mother, the user might be following those policies. Even if the mother wasn't the one playing, she's the one purchasing, so the user's warning is appropriate.\n\nAnother angle: the user didn't force the mother not to buy it; they just provided information. The mother made the decision herself after being informed. That's a key point. The user didn't pressure her but gave the facts, which is the right approach.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the user was too graphic in details? But the mother asked for more info, so it's reasonable to explain the content. Also, the mother is responsible, not the user. The user isn't the parent, so their role is to inform, not to decide.\n\nIn conclusion, the user acted in a responsible manner by providing necessary information for the parent to make a decision. They weren't overstepping; they were fulfilling their role as an informed employee. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
