I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for dissuading a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author works in a store and was helping a customer. The mother wanted a game for her son, who is very young. GTA V has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The author explained the game's content, including graphic scenes, sexual themes, and swearing. The mother then decided not to buy it. \n\nThe co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but the author's intention was to inform the mother so she could make an educated decision. The author argues that they were doing what they would want if they were in the mother's position, which is a reasonable perspective. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the job of someone in electronics at a store might involve providing information about products. The mother asked for more info, so the author was just giving details she requested. The author didn't force her not to buy it; they provided facts. The M rating is a clear indicator, but the author went further to explain specific content that might be concerning for a young child.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction seems to be more about not wanting to be told what's appropriate for their son, but the author's role is to inform. There's no indication the author overstepped by being rude or aggressive. They simply shared information that could influence the mother's decision. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's generally seen as responsible to warn about content that could be inappropriate for a child's age. The author isn't forcing the mother to do anything but is giving her the necessary information to make a choice. The mother then made the decision not to buy it, which shows the information was useful. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They were fulfilling their role by providing accurate information, which is in line with helping customers make informed decisions.\n"
