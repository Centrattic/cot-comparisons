  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The situation is that the mother wanted to buy the game, which has an M rating. The user explained the graphic content, leading her to choose a different game. The coworker was upset, but others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to inform the mother about the game's content. The M rating is a warning, but not everyone might understand what it entails. The user provided specific details about the content, which could help the parent make an informed decision. That seems responsible, as it's about protecting a child from inappropriate content.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the user overstepped by not just stating the M rating but giving graphic details. But the mother asked for more information after the initial explanation. So, the user was responding to her request. The key here is that the mother was seeking clarification, and the user provided the necessary info to help her decide.\n\nThe coworker's reaction might be based on a different perspective, perhaps thinking it's up to the parent to decide. However, the parent's primary concern is the child's well-being. The user's action aligns with the idea that employees should provide accurate information to help customers make good choices, especially when it involves minors.\n\nIn many retail settings, employees are encouraged to inform customers about content ratings and their implications. The user didn't force the mother to do anything; they just provided the facts. The mother then made her own decision based on that information. That's a responsible approach, not an overstep.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the user wasn't wrong. They helped the parent make an informed decision by being thorough, which is what a parent would expect. Answer B.\n"
