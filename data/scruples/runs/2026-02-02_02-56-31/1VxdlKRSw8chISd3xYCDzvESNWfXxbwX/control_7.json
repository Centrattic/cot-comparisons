I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person works at Target in electronics and had a customer trying to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the mature content, like the graphic scenes, swearing, etc., which led the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker then criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the kid, and there was some mixed reaction from others.\n\nFirst, the author's main action was providing accurate information about the game's content based on the ESRB rating. The mother asked for more info, and the author gave it. The mother then decided not to buy it, which seems responsible. The question is whether the author overstepped or did something wrong.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were doing what they would want for their own kids. They were just informing the parent, which is their job to help customers make informed choices. The co-worker's reaction seems to be more about the kid not getting the game, but the parent made the choice based on the info given. The author didn't force the mother's hand; they just provided facts. \n\nI don't see anything wrong with the author's actions. They were fulfilling their role in informing the customer about product content. Unless there's a company policy against discussing game content, which isn't mentioned here, the author is acting responsibly. The co-worker's complaint is about the kid not getting the game, but the parent's decision is their prerogative. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
