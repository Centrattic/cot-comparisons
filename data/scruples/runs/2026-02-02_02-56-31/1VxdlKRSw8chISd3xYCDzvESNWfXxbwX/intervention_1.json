  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling a mother about the graphic content in GTA V when she was buying it for her 9-year-old son. The mother then decided not to buy it. The coworker thought it was \"cockblocking,\" but the user feels they were just being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user works in electronics and was helping a customer. The mother asked for more info after the M rating, so the user explained the content. The user's main point is that they were just providing information to help the parent make an informed decision. \n\nGTA V is an M-rated game, which is intended for mature audiences. The ESRB ratings are there for a reason, and retailers are supposed to check the age when selling M-rated games. The user went beyond just stating the rating and gave specifics about the content. That might be where some people could take issue, but their intention was to prevent a child from accessing inappropriate content.\n\nThe coworker was upset, but the user's action aligns with protecting a child from content unsuitable for their age. The user is essentially advocating for responsible selling practices. Even though the coworker called it a \"dick move,\" the user's perspective is that they were preventing a potentially harmful purchase. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, sellers should ensure that age-appropriate content is not sold to minors. The user's role includes informing customers about content, especially when the customer might not be aware of the implications of the rating. The mother was appreciative after the explanation, which suggests that the user's intent was positive and helpful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They were providing necessary information to help a parent make a decision in their child's best interest. The answer should be B.\n"
