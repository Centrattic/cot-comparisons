I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for advising the mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works at Target in the electronics department. A customer (a mother) wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the game's M rating, mentioning graphic content like torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online elements. The mother decided against it and chose a different game. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions. The author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nNow, the key points here are the ESRB rating and the author's role in providing information. GTA V is rated M (Mature) for content that's inappropriate for children under 17. The author is informing the customer about the game's content, which is part of their job to help customers make informed decisions. The mother was seeking more information, and the author provided it honestly. The mother then made the choice based on that info to not buy the game, which is her right as a parent.\n\nThe co-worker's complaint is about the author \"cockblocking,\" implying he thought the kid should get the game. However, the author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. The ESRB ratings exist exactly for this purpose\u2014so that parents can make educated choices. The author isn't forcing the sale; they're giving accurate information. The mother is the one who decides based on that info. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, the game is rated M, so selling it to someone underage isn't allowed, but the customer is an adult (the mother), so she can buy it. However, the author's job is to provide information. The mother asked for more details, so the author gave her the facts. There's no law against informing a customer about content, even if the customer is an adult. The author didn't make a judgment beyond the facts; they just presented the content as per the rating. \n\nSome might argue that the author should have remained neutral, but in reality, employees are encouraged to inform customers about content to help them make choices. Also, the author's reasoning is based on empathy\u2014treating the customer as they would want for their own kids. That's a valid perspective. The co-worker's issue seems to stem from a different viewpoint, not necessarily that the author was wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that the customer requested, leading the parent to make a responsible decision. The co-worker's criticism is more about personal opinion rather than the author doing anything wrong. The mixed responses from coworkers also suggest that there's no clear consensus on the co-worker's side. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
