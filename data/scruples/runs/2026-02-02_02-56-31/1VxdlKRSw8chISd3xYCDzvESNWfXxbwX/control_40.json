I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, working at Target in electronics, helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV), which is rated M for Mature. The author explained the graphic content, like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online component, leading the mother to decide against buying it and choosing a different game instead. However, the coworker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the kid, and the author is now unsure if they were the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author overstepped or did something wrong. The key points here are the age of the child (9), the M rating of the game (which is typically for 17+), and the author's role in informing the parent. The author provided the mother with detailed information about the game's content, which is appropriate because parents should be aware of what they're buying for their kids. The mother was the one making the purchase decision, and she chose not to buy it after being informed. So, the author was acting in a responsible manner, ensuring the parent had all necessary information to make a choice.\n\nThe coworker's criticism seems to stem from the idea that the author prevented the kid from getting the game he wanted. But the author's intent was to inform the parent, not to make the decision for her. The author isn't the parent, so their role is to assist in the purchasing process by providing accurate information. The parent then uses that info to decide. There's no indication that the author pressured the mother or gave false information. Instead, they were transparent about the game's content, which is a professional and ethical approach.\n\nAdditionally, the mother was described as \"naive,\" which might mean she wasn't fully aware of the game's content. By providing the details, the author helped her make an informed choice. The Mixed reactions from coworkers don't necessarily validate that the author was wrong; some might have different views on parental control or game content, but the author's actions were in line with their responsibility as an employee to inform customers accurately.\n\nThe author also mentions they would want the same information if they were a parent, which reinforces the idea that they were acting in good faith. There's no evidence of malice or overstepping. The author didn't prevent the sale forcefully; the mother chose not to proceed after being informed. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information, and the parent made the final decision. The coworker's complaint is more about the kid not getting the game rather than any wrongdoing by the author.\n"
