  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for stopping a mother from buying GTAV for her 9-year-old. They gave more details about the game's content, which led the mom to choose a different game. The co-worker thought it was \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to protect a child from inappropriate content. GTAV is an M-rated game with explicit content, so informing the parent about the graphic elements seems responsible. The mother did ask for more info after the M rating, so the user provided necessary details. \n\nThe mother then decided against buying it, which is her right as a parent. The co-worker's criticism is about interfering, but the user's action was in the best interest of the child. The user also mentions they'd want the same info if they were buying for their kids. \n\nSo, the user's actions were ethical. They provided accurate information, allowed the parent to make a decision, and prevented a purchase that might not be suitable. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
