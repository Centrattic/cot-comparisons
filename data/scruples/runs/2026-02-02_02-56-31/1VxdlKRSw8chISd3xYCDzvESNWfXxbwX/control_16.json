  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is working at Target in electronics and encountered a situation where a mother wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The employee explained the M rating and detailed the graphic content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" but the employee feels they were just providing necessary information.\n\nFirst, consider the age of the child. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which according to the ESRB is for ages 17+. The game includes violence, strong language, and sexual content. A 9-year-old is way below that age range, so the employee is highlighting the inappropriateness based on the rating.\n\nThe employee's role is to inform customers about the product, including content warnings. The mother asked for more info, so the employee provided it. The mother then decided against the purchase, which is a positive outcome. The employee wasn't forcing a decision but giving facts to help the mother make an informed choice.\n\nThe co-worker's complaint is about interfering, but the employee's actions align with the store's purpose to inform customers. The employee isn't acting maliciously; they're following guidelines and their own ethical stance to protect a child from inappropriate content.\n\nSome might argue that the employee overstepped, but since the mother asked for details and the employee provided accurate, relevant info, they're doing their job ethically. The key point is that the employee didn't prevent the sale but facilitated the mother's decision-making process. Therefore, the employee isn't in the wrong.\n"
