  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person works at Target in the electronics department. A customer, a mother, wants to buy GTAV for her 9-year-old son. The employee explains the M rating, which stands for Mature, and goes into details about the game's content like graphic torture, sexual themes, swearing, and the online component. The mother then decides not to buy the game. The co-worker is upset because he thought the employee was \"cockblocking\" him, and there's some mixed reactions from coworkers.\n\nThe main question is whether the employee was in the wrong by providing detailed information that led the mother to change her purchase. \n\nFrom what I know, video games have ratings for a reason. The M rating is supposed to alert parents that the game is suitable for 17 and older. As an employee, part of the job might be to inform customers about the product they're buying. The employee provided accurate information about the content, which is a service to the customer. The mother was concerned and made an informed decision based on that info. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The employee didn't just mention the M rating but gave graphic details about specific content. Maybe the co-worker felt that the employee was being too direct or even judgmental. However, the mother was asking for more information, so the employee answered honestly. \n\nAnother point is that the job might require employees to adhere to certain content guidance policies. If the store encourages employees to provide detailed content warnings, then it's part of their role. If not, maybe they overstepped. But since the mother was seeking more info, the employee was helpful. \n\nThe employee's reasoning is that they would want the same info if they were in the customer's position. That's a valid perspective based on the golden rule. The employee's actions led to a positive outcome where the parent made a different choice, which aligns with protecting a child from inappropriate content.\n\nPotential counterarguments: The employee might have given more details than necessary, but since the customer asked for more info, it's part of the job. Also, the M rating is already a warning, but the customer might not understand what it entails. The employee's explanation clarified why it's rated M, which is useful. \n\nIn terms of company policy, if the store allows employees to discuss content details, then it's okay. If they have a policy against it, then maybe not. But since the scenario doesn't mention any policy violation, like being reprimanded, it's safe to assume it's within acceptable boundaries.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction is more about personal frustration that the game wasn't purchased, but that's their issue. The employee's role is to assist the customer, and the customer made a decision based on accurate info. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the employee acted responsibly by providing necessary information that helped the parent make an informed choice. The action was in the best interest of the child, so I don't think the employee is in the wrong.\n"
