  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they work at Target in electronics, and a mother came in wanting to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The person explained the M rating, mentioned the graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, and swearing. The mother then decided not to buy it and chose a different game. The coworker was upset about this and others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which the person did mention. The mother asked for more info after the rating, so maybe she wasn't sure what M entailed. The person provided specifics about the content, which led the mother to make a different choice. The coworker felt it was \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed responses.\n\nThe question is about whether the person was wrong for doing that. From a parental perspective, if a parent is trying to make an informed decision, having more details about the content would help them decide. The person is essentially helping the parent by giving accurate info about the game's content, which is age-inappropriate for a 9-year-old. The M rating is meant to indicate that it's suitable for ages 17 and up, so the person is acting in line with the rating's purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, could there be a downside? Maybe the coworker felt the person was overstepping, but the main goal was to inform the parent. Since the parent was seeking information and the person provided it, it seems they were being responsible. The parent's decision was based on the information given, which is exactly what the person intended. There's no indication that the person was rude or forced the decision, just that they shared the details. In many places, there are laws about not selling mature-rated games to minors, but the person is just advising here, not refusing a sale. So, I think the person's action was appropriate and not wrong.\n"
