  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they were in the wrong for dissuading a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user works at Target in electronics. They helped a customer buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The customer asked for GTA V, which is rated M for Mature. The user explained the M rating and detailed the graphic content, like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decided not to buy it. The co-worker was upset, saying the user was \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it. Now the user is unsure if they were the asshole.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that if they were in a similar situation, they'd want to know the game's content to make an informed decision. They think they were just giving the mother the info she needed.\n\nSo, am I in the wrong? Let's consider the possible angles. On one hand, the user is providing accurate information about the game's content, which is appropriate given the age of the child. The M rating is a clear indicator, but the user went further to explain specific content. The mother was concerned and changed her purchase. That seems responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker felt that the user overstepped. But the user's actions were in line with their job to inform customers about product content. The user isn't forcing the sale; they're ensuring the customer makes an informed choice. The mother had asked for more information, so the user's detailed explanation was in response to her request.\n\nEthically, it's about protecting the child from inappropriate content. The user's actions align with parental responsibility, not hindering the sale but helping the parent make the right decision. The co-worker's complaint seems misplaced because the user is doing their job correctly.\n\nPotential issues could be if the user was being judgmental or not professional, but the description doesn't indicate that. The user provided facts, not opinions. The mother appreciated the info and made a different purchase. The user's motivation was to help the mother, not to cockblock arbitrarily.\n\nTherefore, the user's actions were justified. They provided necessary information, respected the parent's role, and helped prevent a purchase that might be inappropriate. The co-worker's annoyance is just a differing opinion, but the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
