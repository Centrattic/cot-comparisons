  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong to detail the graphic content of GTA V to a mother buying it for her 9-year-old son. The mother ended up not purchasing it after being informed. The co-worker criticized the user for \"cockblocking\" the kid, but the user's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which typically means content suitable for 17+. The mother's son is 9, so there's a clear age gap. The user mentioned the game's explicit content like torture, sexual themes, and swearing. Those are important factors that parents should know to make an informed decision. \n\nThe user's role at Target is to help customers, which includes providing accurate information about products. By explaining the content, the user was fulfilling their duty to inform the customer. The mother did ask for more information, so the user was responding to her request. The co-worker's reaction might stem from a different perspective, maybe thinking the kid should be allowed to play if the parent buys it, but the user's stance is about the parent's right to know.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's a responsibility to inform parents about content that could be harmful for minors. The user isn't enforcing any rules but is advising based on the game's rating and content. The mother made the choice herself after being informed, so the user didn't override her decision but provided necessary info.\n\nPossible counterarguments could be that the user went beyond the M rating by detailing specific scenes. However, given the mother's explicit request for more information, providing those details is appropriate. The mixed reactions from coworkers suggest some might not see the issue, but others might agree with the user. Ultimately, the user's intention was protective, acting in the best interest of the child. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
