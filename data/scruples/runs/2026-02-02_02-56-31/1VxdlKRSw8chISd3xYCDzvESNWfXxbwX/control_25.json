  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThey work at Target in electronics. A customer came in to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the M rating and the graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided not to buy it and got another game. Then the co-worker called it \"videogame cockblocking\" and made a big deal in the break room with mixed reactions. The author is unsure if they were the asshole for not letting the mother buy the game.\n\nFirst, the ESRB rating for GTA V is M for Mature, which is 17+. But the mother was buying it for a 9-year-old. The author provided detailed info about the content, which led the mother to change her mind. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nOn one hand, the author was giving accurate information about the game's content. The mother might not have known the specifics of the M rating. By explaining the graphic scenes, the author helped her make an informed decision. The mother herself was concerned after the explanation, so she chose a different game. That seems like a responsible action to protect a child from inappropriate content.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker and others thought it was a \"dick move.\" Maybe they felt the author overstepped, even though the mother asked for more info. But the author's reasoning is that if they were in the same situation, they would want to know the content for their own kids. That's a common-sense approach to parental guidance.\n\nThe ESRB ratings exist to inform parents, but sometimes people don't take them seriously. By elaborating on the specific content, the author might have done a service to the mother who might not otherwise have considered the explicit nature of the game. The mother's decision to not buy it after the explanation suggests that the author's intervention was helpful.\n\nSo, the author didn't force the mother not to buy it; they just provided the necessary details. The mother made the choice herself. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
