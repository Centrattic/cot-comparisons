I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV) for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" but the employee feels they were just being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The employee provided information about the game's content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker and some others found this behavior excessive or unnecessary. The employee's reasoning is that they were doing what they would want for their own kids if they were in the mother's position.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The employee's actions were to inform the customer about the game's content, which is rated M (for Mature). The M rating is meant to indicate that the game is suitable for ages 17 and up, so selling it to a 9-year-old would be inappropriate. The employee is acting in line with the ratings system, which is designed to help parents make informed decisions.\n\nThe co-worker's complaint is about \"cockblocking,\" suggesting that the employee overstepped by actively discouraging the purchase. But is there a line here between providing information and imposing personal values? The employee didn't prevent the sale outright; they simply gave the mother more details, and she made her own decision based on that. The employee was doing their job to inform, which is what the ratings system expects retailers to do.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the employee went beyond just stating the M rating and gave graphic details that could be seen as judgmental. However, the mother asked for more information, so the employee was responding appropriately to her request. The employee's intention was to help the parent make a responsible choice, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe mixed reactions from coworkers indicate differing opinions, but the core issue is about responsibility to the customer's children. The employee is in a position where they have knowledge about the product's content and a duty to inform customers, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. \n\nConsidering all this, the employee isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that led the parent to make an informed decision. The co-worker's frustration seems to stem from a belief that the employee shouldn't have interfered, but the employee's actions align with ethical retail practices and parental responsibility.\n"
