I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author works at Target in electronics and was helping a customer, a mother, buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The customer asked for GTA V, and the author explained the M rating, which is for mature audiences. The mother wanted more info, so the author described some of the more graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother then decided not to buy GTA V and went with another game. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the child and talked about it in the break room with mixed reactions.\n\nThe question is whether the author did the right thing. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). The author's reasoning is that if they were a parent buying a game they knew nothing about, they'd want to know about the content to make a good decision. So the author did what they think a responsible parent would want.\n\nFirst, I should consider the responsibilities of an employee in this context. Retail workers, especially in electronics or games, are often expected to provide truthful information about products. GTA V is explicitly rated M for mature content, which includes violence, strong language, and sexual themes. The author was informing the customer about the game's content, which is part of their job to ensure appropriate sales based on ratings. The mother was seeking that information, so the author didn't just volunteer it without being asked.\n\nHowever, the co-worker's criticism is that the author was overstepping by not letting the child get the game. But the mother was the one making the purchase, so the author's role is to inform the parent, not the child. The ESRB ratings are in place for a reason, and employees are supposed to respect those guidelines. The author didn't prevent the sale but provided necessary details that allowed the parent to make an informed choice. The parent then chose a different game after being informed. \n\nThe key points here are the ESRB rating, the parent's right to know about the content, and the employee's duty to comply with rating guidelines. The author didn't act unprofessionally; they adhered to the policy of informing customers about content. The mother was in a position to decide based on the information given. The co-worker's disapproval seems to be from a different angle, perhaps thinking the child should get the game regardless. But the employee's job is to follow the regulations around age-appropriate content, so they're not in the wrong for doing their duty. Unless there's a policy against discussing game content in detail, which I don't think is the case here, the author was just helping the customer make a responsible choice. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
