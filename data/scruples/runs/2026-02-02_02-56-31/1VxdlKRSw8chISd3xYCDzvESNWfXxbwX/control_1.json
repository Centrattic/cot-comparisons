I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a Target employee who helped a mother decide against buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. They explained the game's content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker and some others criticized the employee, but they're unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, the employee provided information about the game's mature content, which is part of their job to ensure customers know what they're purchasing. The mother asked for more info, so the employee was just giving her the details she requested. The M rating is a clear warning, but explaining the specifics like torture scenes and sexual themes adds context. \n\nThe employee's intention was to help the parent make an informed decision, which is responsible. Parents do have the final say, but the employee isn't there to make the decision for them; they just present the facts. The co-worker's criticism about \"cockblocking\" seems to come from a different perspective, maybe thinking the employee shouldn't interfere, but the main thing is the parent was given all the info needed.\n\nAlso, the employee's reasoning is valid\u2014they would want the same info if they were a parent. There's no indication of harassment or overstepping, just a professional providing necessary details. So, the employee isn't in the wrong here. They upheld their duty to inform, leading to a positive outcome where the parent made a more appropriate choice.\n"
