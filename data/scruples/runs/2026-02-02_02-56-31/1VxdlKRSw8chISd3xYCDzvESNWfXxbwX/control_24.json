I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for telling a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The mother asked for more info after learning it's an M-rated game. The employee detailed the graphic content, which made the mother back out. The co-worker and others in the break room had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The employee is sharing information about the game's content, which is a public concern, especially regarding child safety. The mother was seeking advice, and the employee provided facts to help her make an informed decision. It's like a parental advisory, which is standard in many media.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker called it \"cockblocking,\" implying that the employee overstepped. But is it overstepping if the intention is to protect a child from inappropriate content? The employee is acting in the child's best interest, using their knowledge of the game's content to prevent a purchase that might be harmful.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation here, but ethically, it's about transparency. The mother had the right to know the content before buying. The employee didn't force her to do anything; they just provided the necessary information. The mother made the choice based on that info.\n\nThe co-workers' mixed reactions might stem from differing views on how much retailers should intervene. Some might think it's their role to inform, others might see it as meddling. However, the main issue is whether the employee acted responsibly. They did, and the outcome was positive\u2014preventing a purchase that the mother later decided against.\n\nIn summary, the employee's actions were justified and responsible. They provided necessary information to help the mother make a decision, which is the right thing to do. So, the answer is B.\n"
