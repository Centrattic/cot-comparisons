  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the user is in the wrong for explaining the graphic content in GTAV to a mother considering buying it for her 9-year-old. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user works at Target, helped a mother buy a game for her son, and when she was asked for more info, he detailed the M-rated content like torture, sex, swearing, and online elements. The mother decided against GTAV, and the co-worker criticized him for \"cockblocking.\" Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child (9), the M rating (which is meant for mature audiences, typically 17+), and the user's role in providing detailed information about the content. The mother asked for more info, so the user answered truthfully. The M rating is a content advisory, so the user was just explaining what that entails. Parents are supposed to use these ratings to make informed decisions. By giving an honest account, the user is helping the parent make a responsible choice. \n\nHowever, maybe the user overstepped by being too graphic? But the mother explicitly asked for more details after the initial mention of the M rating. If she wanted to know specifics to assess appropriateness, then providing that info is appropriate. The co-worker's issue seems to be with the user influencing the purchase decision, but the user was just answering the parent's questions. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that he would want the same info if he were in the parent's shoes. That makes sense because transparency is important when it comes to children's exposure to content. The user didn't force the mother to make a choice; he just provided the necessary information so she could decide. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. He was fulfilling his role in informing the customer about the product's content, especially when there's a concern about age-appropriateness. The co-worker's reaction is more about personal opinion on whether the content is suitable, not about the user's obligation to inform.\n"
