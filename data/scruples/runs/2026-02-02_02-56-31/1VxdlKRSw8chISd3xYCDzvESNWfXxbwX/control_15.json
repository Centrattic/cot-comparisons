I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The situation is about an employee at Target who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-workers had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what GTA V's content is like. It's rated M for Mature, which is intended for 17+ according to the ESRB. The game does have violence, strong language, sexual content, and other adult themes. The employee explained the M rating and gave specifics when the mother asked for more info. The mother then decided against buying it.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were providing necessary information to help the parent make an informed decision. They argue that if they were in the parent's position, they'd want that info. The co-worker criticized them for \"cockblocking\" but others were mixed.\n\nLegally, in the U.S., there's the First Amendment protection for video games as speech. However, the employee wasn't restricting the sale; they just provided information. The parent still had the choice to buy it or not. The employee's job might involve advising on appropriate content, especially since stores often enforce age ratings.\n\nEthically, the question is about the employee's responsibility to inform. Parents have a duty to know what their kids are consuming, and the employee helped them make a better decision. The co-worker's complaint seems more about not wanting the kid to be deprived of a game, but the parent's responsibility is primary here.\n\nThe key points are that the employee gave accurate information in response to the parent's inquiry, the parent used that info to make a choice, and the employee didn't overstep by not selling the game. The employee's actions align with helping the parent make an informed decision, which is in line with responsible sales practices and parental rights.\n"
