  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for explaining the graphic content of GTA V to a mother so she wouldn't buy it for her 9-year-old. They want to know if their actions were appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was buying a game for her son, and the user provided detailed information about the game's content. The mother then decided not to buy it. The coworker felt it was a \"cockblock,\" but the user's reasoning is to protect the child from inappropriate content.\n\nThe user's main argument is that they were informing the parent about the game's M rating and specific contents, which is their responsibility as someone working in electronics. The M rating is meant for mature audiences, and by explaining the content, they helped the parent make an informed decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might argue that it was overstepping, but the user didn't force the mother to not buy the game; they just provided information. The parent made the decision themselves after being informed. \n\nIn many places, stores are expected to follow age rating guidelines to prevent minors from purchasing inappropriate content. By explaining the content, the user is acting in line with those guidelines. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They were doing their job to inform the customer about the product's content, which is part of helping the customer make a responsible choice. The coworker's reaction is more about feeling their sale was blocked, but the user's intent was protective. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
