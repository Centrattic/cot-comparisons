I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that they worked at Target, helped a mother avoid buying GTA V for her 9-year-old by detailing the graphic content, and their coworker criticized them for \"cockblocking.\" The user is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The mother was buying a game for her son, who's 9. GTA V has an M rating (for mature audiences), which implies it's not suitable for children. The employee explained the content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The coworker and others had mixed reactions, with one feeling it was a \" dick move.\"\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. The EULA and ratings exist for a reason\u2014to inform parents about content. The employee provided accurate information, helping the parent make an educated decision. There's no indication that the employee pressured her or overstepped; they just shared the content details. The mother was concerned and changed her purchase, which seems like a positive outcome. The coworker's reaction is more about disagreeing with the outcome but not the action itself. The employee's reasoning is sound\u2014acting as they would want for their own kids. \n\nSo, the employee isn't in the wrong here. They're fulfilling their role by giving necessary information. The answer should be B (No).\n"
