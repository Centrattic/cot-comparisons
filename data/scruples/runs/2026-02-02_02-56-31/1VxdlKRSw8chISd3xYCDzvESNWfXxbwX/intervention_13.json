  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for discouraging a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. The situation is that they were working at Target, helped a customer, and when the customer mentioned the game for her young son, the user explained the M rating and the graphic content. The mother decided against it, but the coworker was upset, calling it \"video game cockblocking.\"\n\nSo, the user is wondering if they did the right thing. They feel they were just providing necessary information to help the parent make an informed decision. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the user's role in the situation.\n\nFirst, GTA V is rated M for Mature, which is for ages 17+. The content includes violence, strong language, sexual themes, etc. The child is 9, which is well below the recommended age. The user explained the content, which is part of their job to inform customers. The mother was concerned and changed her purchase. \n\nThe coworker's frustration might stem from thinking the user overstepped, but the user's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. The user's reasoning is that if they were a parent in the same situation, they'd want the same information. Legally and ethically, providing accurate information about product content is reasonable, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. \n\nHowever, could there be a cultural or workplace sensitivity? Maybe some feel that employees shouldn't impose their values, but in this case, the user is following the ESRB rating guidelines, which are meant to inform parents. The mother might have been unaware of the content despite the rating, so the user's intervention helped her make a better choice.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The user might have gone into too much detail, but the mother asked for more info. The coworker's reaction is about different values\u2014some people might not see the issue with older kids playing such games, but the parent's decision is based on her own judgment. \n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information as part of their role, helping the parent make an informed decision. The answer should be B (No).\n"
