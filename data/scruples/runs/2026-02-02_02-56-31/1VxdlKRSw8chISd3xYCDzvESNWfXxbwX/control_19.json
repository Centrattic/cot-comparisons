  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is working at Target in the electronics section. They helped a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The kid wanted GTA V, which is an M-rated game ( Mature, for ages 17+). The person explained that it's rated M, and then went into detail about the graphic content: torture scenes, sexual themes, intense swearing, and the online aspect. The mother then decided not to buy it and went with a different game. The coworker was upset, called it \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal in the break room with mixed reactions.\n\nThe person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for stopping the purchase. They argue that they were just doing what they would want if they were a parent buying a game they didn't know much about. They wanted the mother to be informed about the content to make a good decision for her child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the age of the child (9 years old), the M rating of the game, the person providing detailed info about the content, and the coworker's reaction. \n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, as an employee, it's their responsibility to inform customers about the game's content when asked. The mother asked for more information, so the person gave it. They didn't force her to not buy it; she made her own decision. The coworker's issue is more about the method\u2014maybe they felt it was overkill to go into graphic details. But the main goal was to provide accurate info so the parent could make an informed choice. Since the parent was the one who decided not to buy it, the employee isn't the problem. The coworker might have a different opinion on how it was handled, but the action itself is justified. Also, the M rating is a warning, so explaining why it's rated that way is appropriate. So I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
