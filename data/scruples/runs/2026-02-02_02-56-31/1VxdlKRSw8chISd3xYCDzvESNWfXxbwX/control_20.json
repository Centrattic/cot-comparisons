I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for stopping a 9-year-old from buying GTA V. They explained the game's mature content to the mom, leading her to choose a different game. Their co-worker thought it was \"cockblocking,\" but the person feels they were just helping the parent make an informed choice.\n\nFirst, GTA V is rated M for mature audiences. The store employee is sharing accurate information about the game's content, which includes violence, swearing, and other adult themes. The mother wanted to know more, and the employee provided details to help her decide. The employee isn't forcing the mom to do anything; they're giving her the facts. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is a bit of a red herring. Just because someone else thinks it's a \"dick move\" doesn't mean the action is wrong. The employee's motivation was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which aligns with common parental concerns. The question is whether the employee overstepped. Since they only gave information and the mom made the final decision, it's hard to say they did anything wrong. The key point is that the employee facilitated an informed choice rather than imposing their own views. \n\nAlso, the employee's reasoning about wanting the same transparency for their own kids makes sense. It's a common ethical stance to treat others how you'd want to be treated. There's no evidence of harassment or coercion here, just honest communication. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
