I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a mom not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, GTA V is an M-rated game, which means it's for mature audiences. The M rating typically includes graphic violence, sexual content, and strong language. The author explained these details to the mother, which led her to choose a different game. The co-worker was upset about it, but the author's reasoning is that they would want the same information if they were buying a game for their own kids.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author was providing accurate information about the game's content. Retail employees often give such advice to help parents make informed decisions. The mother was seeking more info, so the author didn't force her but provided the facts. The co-worker's reaction seems more about not wanting to block the sale rather than a moral issue.\n\nLegally, in many places, stores can't sell M-rated games to minors, but the mother was buying it for her son, so the store might be liable if they don't check the age. However, the author is a staff member helping, not the cashier, so maybe they're just ensuring the sale is appropriate. \n\nThe author's actions seem responsible. They\u2019re acting in the best interest of the child, following the rating guidelines, and helping the parent make a decision. The co-worker's criticism is about interfering, but the author isn't in the wrong for doing their job and providing necessary info. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
