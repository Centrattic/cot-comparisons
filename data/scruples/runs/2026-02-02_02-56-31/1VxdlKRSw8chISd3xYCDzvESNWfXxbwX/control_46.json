I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AITA) scenario is in the wrong for telling a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The author of the scenario worked at Target and was helping a customer when they provided detailed information about the game's mature content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker and some others thought it was \"cockblocking,\" but the author feels they were doing the right thing by informing the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's main argument is that they were providing necessary information to help the parent make an informed decision. The game has an M rating, which stands for Mature, typically 17+. The parent's son is 9 years old, which is way under the recommended age. The author mentioned graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, and strong language. As a responsible employee, sharing that info seems appropriate because the parent asked for more details. The author wasn't preventing the sale; they were offering information to help the parent decide. The parent then chose not to buy the game, which is a positive outcome from the author's perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker's reaction is that it was a \"dick move,\" but that's more about the author's social dynamics at work rather than the rightness of the action itself. The co-worker might not see the importance of content warnings, especially for a young child. However, the author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which is a common-sense approach. \n\nLegally and ethically, retailers aren't required to stop a sale based on age ratings, but they can provide information. The author didn't refuse the sale; they just informed the parent. The mother had the right to know, and the author's action is in line with responsible sales practices. There's no indication that the author was violating company policy or overstepping. The author is acting in the best interest of the child, even if it means the store didn't make a sale. \n\nAnother angle is the parent's responsibility. The parent asked for more information, which implies they wanted to make a responsible decision. The author facilitated that. If the author hadn't provided the details, the parent might have bought the game without knowing the content, which could lead to issues later. So, the author's intervention prevented a potentially problematic purchase.\n\nThe co-workers' mixed reactions might stem from different opinions on how involved employees should get in customers' purchasing decisions. But the author's action isn't about making a judgment on the parent's choice but providing necessary info. The author is in a position to know the game's content and has a duty to inform when asked. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided accurate information, helped the parent make an informed choice, and acted in the best interest of the child. The co-workers' criticism is more about personal opinions and not about the author's ethical responsibility.\n"
