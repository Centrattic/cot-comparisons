I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The OP works in a store and was helping a mother buy a game for her son. The mother wanted GTA V for her 9-year-old. The OP explained the M rating, mentioned graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, bad language, and the online aspect. The mother then decided not to buy it and chose another game. The co-worker was upset about this, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" but the mother was grateful.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the OP did the right thing. Let me break down the key points. \n\n1. **Parental Responsibility**: GTA V has an M (Mature) rating, which means it's intended for adults. The mother was making a decision for her child, so the OP's role here is to inform her about the game's content. The M rating is a guideline, and stores are supposed to help parents make informed choices. By providing detailed info, the OP is upholding that responsibility.\n\n2. **Age Appropriateness**: A 9-year-old is way below the recommended age for an M-rated game. The OP is essentially preventing the child from being exposed to content that's inappropriate for their age. The mother was uninformed, so the OP's intervention was helpful in ensuring the child isn't exposed to harmful material.\n\n3. **Co-worker's Reaction**: The co-worker was annoyed because he thought the OP was overstepping. However, the co-worker's perspective might be biased, as he was helping the mother and might have wanted the sale to go through. The other coworkers had mixed reactions, which shows there's no clear consensus, but the mother's decision was the right one.\n\n4. **Intent vs. Outcome**: The OP's intent was to inform, not to block the sale for personal gain. He even mentions that if he were a parent, he'd want to know the details. The outcome was positive\u2014mother chose a different game, which aligns with the intent of protecting the child.\n\n5. **Ethical Consideration**: Retail employees have a duty to follow content ratings and warn customers about inappropriate content, especially when minors are involved. The OP is acting as a responsible employee here. Denying a sale when a minor is involved in an inappropriate game isn't \"cockblocking\"; it's adhering to ethical guidelines and legal standards.\n\n6. **Public Interest vs. Personal Gain**: The co-worker's complaint seems to be about the sale not happening, which affects his commission or satisfaction. However, the public interest here is in protecting the child's well-being, which is more important than a single sale.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say the mother should have the autonomy to make that decision, even if it's not age-appropriate. However, the law and game ratings are in place to guide parents, especially for those who might not be aware of the content. The OP's role is to inform, not to judge, and in this case, the information led to a better decision.\n\nAnother angle: The mother was \"naive,\" as per the OP's own words, so the OP's intervention was necessary. If the mother had been informed beforehand, maybe she wouldn't have wanted the game. But since she wasn't, the OP filled in the gap.\n\nAlso, the M rating is a clear indicator, but the mother might not have known what it entails. The OP provided specifics which made the rating's implications clear. Without that, the mother might have proceeded with a purchase she later regretted.\n\nIn conclusion, the OP acted in the best interest of the child by providing necessary information that led the parent to make a more appropriate choice. The co-worker's frustration is misplaced because the priority should be the child's welfare over the sale. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
