  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling a mother about the graphic content in GTA V to prevent her from buying it for her 9-year-old. So first, I need to consider the context. GTA V is an M-rated game, which typically means it's for mature audiences. The M rating includes violence, sexual content, and strong language. The mother asked for more info after knowing the rating, and the employee detailed the content, leading the mother to choose a different game.\n\nThe co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions. The user's reasoning is that they were doing what they would want if they were in the mother's position, wanting to know the content for their own kids. \n\nNow, the key points here: The employee provided factual information about the game's content as requested. The mother was making a purchase decision for a young child, so the employee's concern about appropriate content seems valid. There's no indication that the employee was rude or forced the mother's hand; they offered information which the mother then used to make her choice. \n\nThe co-worker's criticism and the employee's own doubt come from the coworker's perspective, but the main issue is about responsibility in content warnings. In many places, retailers are expected to provide information on age ratings and content. The employee didn't prevent the sale; they just informed the customer, allowing her to decide. \n\nPossible arguments against the employee might be that the mother had the right to choose, but the child's age is very young, and the content is significantly mature. The employee isn't making a judgment but sharing facts. The mother was the one who decided not to buy after being informed. So, the employee acted in a responsible manner, prioritizing the child's well-being by providing necessary information. Therefore, the answer would be that they are not in the wrong.\n"
