  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were in the wrong for telling a mother about the graphic content in GTA V to prevent her from buying it for her 9-year-old. The situation involves a retail job where they provided detailed information about the game's mature content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized them for \"cockblocking\" the kid, and others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, consider the ethical angle. The user's intention was to inform the parent about the game's content, which is rated M for mature audiences. The mother was seeking information, and the user provided it. Parents have a responsibility to know what their children are exposed to, so giving accurate information helps them make informed decisions. The user isn't forcing the decision but providing facts. \n\nNext, the age factor: the child is 9, and the game is rated for 17+. The content mentioned (torture, sexual themes, swearing) is definitely inappropriate for a 9-year-old. By highlighting these aspects, the user is acting in the child's best interest, even if the parent might have thought the game was suitable based on other factors.\n\nRetail employees often have to provide such information. It's part of their role to explain product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. There's no law against giving factual information, so the user isn't violating any rules. The co-worker's frustration might stem from thinking the kid was denied a game, but the parent made the final decision based on the info given.\n\nHowever, one could argue that the user might have gone into unnecessary detail about the graphic scenes. Maybe a summary of the M rating's content would have sufficed. But the mother asked for more info, so the user was just answering her questions honestly. The parent's choice to switch games shows the information was effective in helping her decide.\n\nIn conclusion, the user acted responsibly by informing the parent, which aligns with ethical standards and parental responsibility. The co-worker's criticism is misplaced since the user facilitated a better decision for the child's well-being. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
