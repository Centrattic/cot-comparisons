I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AskReddit post is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author detailed the graphic content to warn the mother, and now his coworker is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The game has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The mother was buying for a child under the recommended age. The author explained the content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The coworker called it \"cockblocking,\" but the author's intention was to inform, not to interfere. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that if he were in the mother's shoes, he'd want to know the game's content. So, he's acting in good faith. The coworkers' mixed reactions don't necessarily make him wrong. The mother made the decision herself after being informed. There's no indication the author forced her not to buy it; he just provided facts. \n\nAlso, the game's content is well-known, so the author isn't exaggerating. The M rating is a standard guideline, so pointing that out is appropriate. The key here is that the author's actions were to inform, not to dictate. The mother had the autonomy to decide, but the author gave her the necessary info to make an informed choice. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. He's being responsible by sharing the game's content to help the parent make a suitable decision for her child. The coworker's reaction is more about the author stepping in to prevent a potentially inappropriate purchase. So the answer should be B.\n"
