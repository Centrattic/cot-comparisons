  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for preventing a 9-year-old from buying GTA V. They gave a detailed explanation about the game's mature content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The coworker called it \"cockblocking,\" but the person just wants to know if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the role of a retail employee. They're supposed to provide information about products. Since the mother was asking for more info, explaining the M rating and specific content like torture scenes, swearing, and online interactions seems appropriate. The employee isn't forcing the sale; they're informing the customer so she can make an informed decision. \n\nThe key here is that the employee didn't lie or withhold information. They were honest about the game's content, which is part of their job. The mother then made the choice not to buy it, which is her right. The coworker's reaction might be more about not wanting to be told what's appropriate for children, but the employee's action was in line with helping the customer make a responsible choice. \n\nAlso, the employee's reasoning is relatable\u2014they would want the same honesty if they were buying a game for their kids. It's about protecting children from inappropriate content, which is a common concern. There's no indication that the employee was rude or overstepped their role; they just provided facts. \n\nSo, in this scenario, the employee isn't in the wrong. They fulfilled their responsibility to inform the customer, leading to a positive outcome where the mother decided against an unsuitable game. The answer should be B.\n"
