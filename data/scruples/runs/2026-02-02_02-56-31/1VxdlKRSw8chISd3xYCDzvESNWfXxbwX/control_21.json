I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person working at Target who dissuaded a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old son, citing the game's M rating and its graphic content. The co-worker felt it was a cockblock, but the author's intention was to protect the child by informing the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's action was to provide detailed information about the game's content to help the parent make an informed decision. The mother did decide against the purchase after being informed. The key here is whether the author overstepped by giving the graphic details or if they were just explaining the content accurately.\n\nIn many places, there are regulations about warning customers about the content of games, especially for minors. The author was probably within their rights to mention the M rating and the reasons behind it. However, the way it was presented might be a point of contention. If the author went beyond the standard warnings and provided explicit details that aren't necessary, that could be seen as overstepping. But the parent explicitly asked for more information, so the author answered truthfully.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is sound. They want to protect children from inappropriate content and are acting in the best interest of the kid. The co-workers' mixed reactions suggest that some might think the author was being overly cautious, but others might agree. The main question is whether providing accurate information about content that's already rated M for mature audiences is wrong. The rating system exists to inform consumers, so the author's role in explaining it isn't necessarily wrong. The mother made the decision not to buy, which shows the information was helpful.\n\nOn the flip side, the co-worker felt it was a \"dick move,\" but that's more about personal opinion. The author isn't in a position to enforce the rating, just to inform. So, the action was appropriate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
