I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author works at Target in the electronics department. A co-worker was helping a customer (a mother) buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The customer wanted to buy GTA V. The author explained the M rating, mentioned graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online component. The mother decided not to buy GTA V after that and picked a different game. Then the co-worker and others criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" and making a big deal. The author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author acted appropriately. The key points here are about the responsibility of retail employees to inform customers about product content, especially concerning age-appropriate materials. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which is intended for ages 17+. The author provided detailed information about the game's content to the customer. The mother was concerned and made a different choice. The author's intention was to help the parent make an informed decision, which aligns with their own hypothetical scenario of wanting accurate info for their own kids.\n\nIn terms of legal or company policy, retail staff are often encouraged or required to inform customers about age ratings and content. The author isn't forcing the mother not to buy the game but is providing necessary information. The co-workers' reactions are mixed, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. The author didn't violate any rules by sharing the content details. The mother had the final say, and the author's role was to assist her in making an informed choice.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author went beyond just stating the rating? They gave specific examples of content (torture, sexual themes, etc.), which are part of the ESRB rating. The ESRB details are meant for parents, so the author is just conveying that info. The parent was naive, so the author helped her out. The co-worker's criticism is about being overzealous, but the author's actions were in the customer's best interest. Also, the mother didn't ask the author to do that; she requested more info. So the author fulfilled her request. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They were fulfilling their role as an informed employee helping a customer make a responsible decision. The answer should be B (No).\n"
