I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, working at Target, talked a mother out of buying GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was upset about it, and the author is unsure if they were the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The mother was buying a game for her child, and the author, knowing the game's M rating and content, provided more details about the graphic elements. The mother then decided against the purchase. The author's reasoning is that they were doing what they would want for their own kids, providing necessary information.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted with good intentions and within reasonable bounds. The author didn't prevent the sale but provided factual information that the mother asked for. The mother made the choice herself after being informed. The author's action seems to be in the interest of the child's well-being and parental responsibility. The co-worker's reaction is more about the author interfering, but the author's intent was to inform, not to judge. \n\nPotential issues could be if the author overstepped by being too graphic, but the scenario says the mother asked for more info. So the author was just answering her questions. The M rating is a warning, but the author's detailed explanation might have given a clearer picture. Since the mother was the one who made the final decision, the author isn't forcing anything. \n\nMost people would likely side with the author here because they were doing their job by providing accurate information about the product's content, which is part of helping customers make informed decisions. The mother's concern after the explanation shows the info was useful. The co-worker's comment about \"cockblocking\" is probably more about not wanting to see someone else's plan foiled, but the author's action was justified. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong) because the author provided necessary info in response to a request, helping the mother make a responsible choice for her child.\n"
