  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they were wrong for telling a mother about the explicit content in GTA V to dissuade her from buying it for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user works at Target and was helping a customer. The mother wanted to buy GTA V for her young son. The user explained the M rating and detailed some of the more graphic elements like torture scenes, sexual content, swearing, and online features. The mother decided not to buy it after that. The co-worker was upset, calling the user a \"dick\" for interfering.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the user did the right thing. On one hand, the user was providing information about the game's content, which the mother asked for. The M rating is a warning, but sometimes parents might not know what that entails. By giving specifics, the user is helping the mother make an informed decision. The user's intention was to prevent a child from being exposed to inappropriate content, which seems protective and responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the user overstepped by being too detailed. However, the mother explicitly asked for more information, so the user was answering her questions honestly. The user isn't forcing the mother to not buy the game but is giving facts to help her decide. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is negative, but it's possible that coworker didn't understand the importance of the content warning. The user's approach seems ethical, as they're looking out for the child's well-being. It's similar to a health warning on a product. If you ask about the ingredients and someone tells you, even if it makes you not buy it, they're not the problem.\n\nSo, I think the user was in the right. They provided necessary information that the customer requested, leading the mother to make a choice she felt was appropriate. The co-worker's criticism is unwarranted here. The answer should be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
