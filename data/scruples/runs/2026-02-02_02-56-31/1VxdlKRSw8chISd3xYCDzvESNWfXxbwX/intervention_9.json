  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they work at Target and helped a mom buy a video game for her 9-year-old. They explained the M rating of GTA V, mentioned the graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mom then decided not to buy it. The co-worker was upset because they felt the person was \"cockblocking\" the kid, and others had mixed reactions.\n\nSo, the main question is whether providing that detailed information was wrong. The key factors here are the responsibility of the salesperson, the age of the child, and the content of the game. The person is acting in a customer service role, and part of their job is to inform customers about product details. The mother asked for more information, so the person provided it. They were trying to help the mother make an informed decision, which seems responsible, especially since the game is rated M (for Mature) which is intended for ages 17+. The parent might not be aware of the specific content, so giving examples of the more graphic scenes could help her decide. However, some might argue that the salesperson overstepped by being too detailed, but given the age of the child and the game's rating, it's a valid concern. The co-worker's reaction suggests that there's a perception of interfering, but the person's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. In many places, there are laws about selling M-rated games to minors, so the employee might also be following those guidelines. Therefore, the person's actions seem justified as they are helping the parent make a responsible choice.\n"
