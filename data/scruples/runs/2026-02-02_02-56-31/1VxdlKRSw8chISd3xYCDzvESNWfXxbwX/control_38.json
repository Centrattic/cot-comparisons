I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for preventing a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author works in a store and is helping a customer. The mother wants to buy a game for her 9-year-old, and the game in question, GTA V, is rated M for mature audiences. The author explains the game's content, including graphic scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online elements. The mother then decides not to buy it. The co-worker criticizes the author for \"cockblocking\" the son, but the author's reasoning is that they're just providing necessary information to help the parent make an informed decision.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the appropriateness of their actions. The author's main goal was to inform the parent about the content to help her decide, which is in line with responsible sales practices. The M rating is a formal warning about content, and the author is reinforcing that. The parent was the one who made the final decision, so the author is just facilitating that process. \n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker's complaint is more about the parent's child not getting the game they wanted. However, the author isn't the parent, and their role is to provide accurate information. There's no indication that the author forced the decision or overstepped their bounds beyond explaining the content. The author also didn't mention any store policy being violated, which would be a potential issue if they were supposed to remain neutral.\n\nLegally and ethically, providing information about product content is usually expected, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. The parent was the one making the purchase decision, and the author's actions helped her make an informed choice. The co-worker's disapproval doesn't outweigh the ethical responsibility to inform customers about product content, especially when it's age-sensitive.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they were fulfilling their role by providing necessary information to help the parent decide, which aligns with both ethical standards and customer service practices.\n"
