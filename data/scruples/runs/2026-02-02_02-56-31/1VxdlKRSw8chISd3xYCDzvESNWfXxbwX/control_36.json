I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AMA) is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what GTA V is like. It's an M-rated game, which stands for Mature. The content includes violence, sexual themes, strong language, and other elements inappropriate for minors. The author detailed the graphic scenes to inform the mother, which led her to choose a different game.\n\nThe co-worker criticized them for \"videogame cockblocking,\" suggesting they were overstepping. But the author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. The mother was seeking information, and the author provided it. The author also mentions that they were acting how they would want someone to act if they were in a similar situation with their own kids.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation for employees to inform customers about game content beyond the rating. But ethically, it's about protecting children from harmful content. The mother made an informed decision based on the info given. The author didn't force her not to buy it; they just shared facts.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction seems more about personal preference\u2014maybe he wanted the sale to go through or didn't agree with the content warning. But the author's action was protective. There's a balance between free speech and protecting minors. The author didn't act out of malice; they acted in what they believed was the child's best interest.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that helped the parent make a responsible choice. The answer should be B.\n"
