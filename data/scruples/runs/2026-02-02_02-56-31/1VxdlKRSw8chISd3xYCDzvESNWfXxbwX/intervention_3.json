  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they were in the wrong for advising a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. Let me start by breaking down the situation. They work in a store, and when a customer came in to buy GTA V for her son, he provided detailed info about the mature content, leading her to choose a different game. His coworker was upset, but others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The user's main point is about protecting a child from content inappropriate for their age. GTA V has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The parent might not be aware of what that entails. By explaining the graphic scenes, swearing, and online aspects, he's informing her so she can make an educated decision. That seems responsible.\n\nThen there's the coworker's reaction. He called it \"cockblocking,\" which is a bit harsh. But the user's intention was to prevent a purchase that might not be suitable. The coworker's focus on his own son versus the user's concern for the child's well-being creates a conflict of priorities.\n\nFrom a customer service perspective, employees are usually trained to provide accurate information about products. The user didn't force the mother to not buy the game; he gave her the facts, which she used to decide. That's within their role. However, the coworker might feel that the user overstepped by being too detailed, but the user's argument is valid because the M rating can be vague to some parents.\n\nLegally, stores aren't required to give such detailed explanations, but there's no law against doing so. Ethically, it's a gray area. Some might say it's the employee's right to share their knowledge to help parents make safe choices. Others might think it's interfering, but the user's intent was good.\n\nThe mother's reaction was positive; she chose a different game, which is the desired outcome. The user is acting in the child's best interest. The coworker's criticism seems to stem from wanting the sale to happen, but that's a different perspective. The user's reasoning about wanting the same for their own kids (if they had any) adds weight to their position.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information to help a parent make a responsible decision, which aligns with protecting the child and respecting the parent's choice. The coworkers' mixed reactions are subjective and don't override the ethical high ground the user is on here.\n"
