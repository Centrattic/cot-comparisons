  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for explaining the graphic content of GTAV to a mother buying a game for her 9-year-old. The main point is whether it's appropriate to influence a customer's purchase based on the game's content rating and specific elements.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned the game has an M rating, which typically means it's for mature audiences. The mother asked for more info, so the user provided details about torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online component. The mother then decided against buying it. The co-worker felt it was \"cockblocking,\" but the user's intention was to inform so the parent could make a responsible choice.\n\nThe key here is the responsibility of someone in a position to provide information. The user's role in electronics might involve advising customers, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. The M rating is a guideline, but not all parents might know what it entails. By explaining the content, the user is acting in the child's best interest, respecting the parent's right to make informed decisions. \n\nHowever, there's a line between informing and overstepping. If the user had gone beyond the M rating and given excessive details, that could be seen as judgmental. But in this case, the user provided the necessary info the parent requested, leading to a positive outcome (not buying the game). The co-worker's reaction is a red herring; the user isn't responsible for others' opinions. \n\nSo, the user's actions align with ethical responsibility\u2014ensuring a child isn't exposed to inappropriate content by informing the parent. They didn't force the decision but provided the facts. Therefore, they're not in the wrong.\n"
