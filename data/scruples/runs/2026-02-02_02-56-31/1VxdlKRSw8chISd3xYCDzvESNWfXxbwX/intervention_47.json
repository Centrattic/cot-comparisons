  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether they were in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user works at Target in electronics. A customer (a mother) wants to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The user explains the M rating, mentions graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, and swearing. The mother decides not to buy it. The co-worker is upset, thinking the user was being a \"dick move\" by blocking the purchase. The user is unsure if they're the asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here. The user provided the mother with detailed information about the game's content, which is age-inappropriate. GTA V is known for its mature content, and the mother might not be fully aware of what the game includes. The user's action was to inform her, which led her to make a different choice. The co-worker's reaction is more about not wanting to be \"cockblocked\" in making a sale, but the user's intent was to protect a child from inappropriate content.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the user is acting in the best interest of the child. Parents are supposed to make informed decisions about what their kids consume. By giving them accurate information, the user is fulfilling their role as a responsible employee. The fact that GTA V has an M rating (for Mature audiences) is a red flag for younger children. The user didn't force the mother to not buy it; they just provided the necessary info, and the mother made the decision herself.\n\nThe co-worker's criticism seems misplaced. The user isn't wrong for standing by their principles. It's like if an employee warned a parent about a dangerous product. The mixed reactions from coworkers don't make the user wrong; they might just have different values. The user's reasoning\u2014that they'd want the same information if they were in the mother's position\u2014is sound. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children, and the user helped them do that.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the user is not in the wrong). They acted ethically by providing necessary information to help the parent make a decision, which is part of their job as a responsible employee.\n"
