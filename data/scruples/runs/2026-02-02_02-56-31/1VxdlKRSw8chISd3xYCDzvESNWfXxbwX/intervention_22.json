  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for advising a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the user's role as an employee.\n\nFirst, GTA V has an M rating, which stands for \"Mature\" and is typically for ages 17 and up. The game contains graphic violence, sexual content, and strong language. The mother was buying it for a 9-year-old, which is way below the recommended age. The employee provided detailed information about the game's content, which led the mother to choose a different game. \n\nThe employee's coworker criticized them for \"cockblocking,\" but the employee's intention was to inform the parent about the content. The employee's reasoning is that they would want the same information if they were buying a game for their own child. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the employee was acting in what they believed was the best interest of the child. Retail employees often have the discretion to advise customers on appropriate content, especially when it comes to age-sensitive products. The mother was seeking information, and the employee provided it. The employee didn't force the mother not to buy the game but gave her the necessary details to make an informed decision. \n\nThe mother ultimately decided against buying GTA V after being informed. The employee's actions align with responsible consumer advisement. There's no indication that the employee overstepped their role or acted with malice. They were transparent and helpful. The coworker's criticism seems to stem from a different perspective, perhaps valuing the sale more than the child's well-being. \n\nIn many places, there are guidelines or even legal considerations about selling age-restricted content to minors. While the employee isn't a parent, their role in providing accurate information is valid. The parent has the final say, but the employee's job includes informing customers about product content. \n\nTherefore, the employee isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information, allowing the parent to make a responsible choice. The mixed reactions from coworkers don't negate the validity of the employee's actions. The user's reasoning is sound, and their intent was to help, not to impose their views."
