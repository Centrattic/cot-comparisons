  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The situation is that the mother was buying the game, the user explained the mature content, and she decided against it. The co-worker was upset about this, even though the user was just providing information.\n\nFirst, GTA V is rated M for mature audiences. The user is informing the parent about the content, which is part of their job in electronics. It's their responsibility to ensure parents know what they're purchasing, especially for kids. The parent was the one who asked for more info, so the user was just answering her questions truthfully.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction is more about being a fan of the game or not wanting to be \"cockblocked,\" but the user's priority should be the customer's best interest, especially when it comes to a child's well-being. The user's reasoning is that if they had kids, they'd want the same information. That makes sense; transparency is key here.\n\nThe user didn't force the mother to do anything; they just provided necessary details. The mother made the decision based on that info. There's no indication the user was rude or overstepped. They were doing their job correctly. The co-workers' mixed reactions probably stem from not seeing the bigger picture of responsible parenting and game ratings.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They helped the parent make an informed choice, which is exactly what they should be doing in their role. The answer should be B.\n"
