I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they worked at Target and helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old. The mother wanted GTA V, which is an M-rated game. The employee explained the graphic content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The coworker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking\" the kid. The author is unsure if they were the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and responsibilities of the employee. Retail employees, especially in electronics or gaming sections, often provide information about products. The ESRB ratings exist for a reason, to inform parents about content. The mother was asking for more info when she didn't know the game, which is common. The employee gave accurate details about the game's content, which is their job to help parents make informed decisions. The mother then decided not to buy it, which seems like a responsible choice given the age of the child and the game's rating.\n\nThe coworker's reaction might be more about the kid not getting the game they wanted, but the employee's role is to inform, not to push sales. There's no indication that the employee went beyond their role or gave false information. The mother was aware of the rating but asked for more details, so the employee's response was appropriate. The employee's reasoning, wanting to be in the same situation with their own kids, makes sense. It's about protecting children from inappropriate content.\n\nI don't see any wrongdoing here. The employee did their job to inform and let the parent decide. The mother made the choice based on that info. The coworker's complaint isn't valid because the employee didn't prevent the sale; they provided necessary info. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
