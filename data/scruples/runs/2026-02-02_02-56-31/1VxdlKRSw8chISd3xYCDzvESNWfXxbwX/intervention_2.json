  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user works in an electronics store, specifically at Target. They helped a customer (a mother) buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mother asked for Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV), which is rated M for Mature. The user explained the M rating, mentioned specific content like graphic torture scenes, sexual themes, intense swearing, and the online component. The mother then decided not to buy GTAV and chose another game instead. The co-worker was with them and later criticized the user for \"cockblocking\" the son, making a big deal about it in the break room. The user is unsure if they were the asshole for stopping the sale, even though they thought they were doing the right thing by providing information to help the parent make an informed decision.\n\nSo the main question is: Is the user in the wrong for doing this?\n\nFirst, I should consider the role of a salesperson in such situations. In the US, there's a law called the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) ratings that classify games based on content. Retailers are generally not required to prevent the sale of mature-rated games to minors, but some stores might have policies. However, in this case, the user wasn't stopping the sale based on age but providing information about content. The mother was the one who decided not to buy it after being informed.\n\nNext, the user's intention was to inform the parent, not to make a judgment. They compared it to wanting to know the content if they were buying a game for their own kids. That's a common ethical stance\u2014acting in the customer's best interest by providing necessary information. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction suggests that some employees might feel that the salesperson overstepped, especially if the customer didn't ask for such detailed information or if the employee felt they were imposing their values. However, the mother was the one who asked for more information after the initial mention of the M rating. The user provided the details requested, and the mother made the decision. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the user isn't violating any laws by providing accurate information about the game's content. Ethically, it's about whether the employee crossed a boundary. The key point is that the user didn't prevent the sale; they provided information that led the customer to make her own choice. The mother was the one who changed her mind, not the employee forcing her hand. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. In some retail environments, employees might be discouraged from giving opinions or unsolicited advice, especially if it affects the customer's decision. The store might prefer to let the customer decide based on their own judgment. But in this case, the mother explicitly asked for more information, so the user was responding to her inquiry. \n\nAnother angle is the co-worker's complaint about \"cockblocking.\" The co-worker might feel that the user was being overly protective or interfering with the child's choice. However, the user's perspective is that protecting a child from inappropriate content is a responsible action. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a general understanding that mature-rated games are not suitable for young children. The ESRB rating system is in place so that parents can make informed decisions. By explaining the content, the user is supporting that system. \n\nSo, considering all these factors: the user acted ethically by providing necessary information upon request, the mother made her own decision based on that information, and there's no legal or policy violation. The user's action was in the best interest of the child, even if it disappointed the co-worker. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
