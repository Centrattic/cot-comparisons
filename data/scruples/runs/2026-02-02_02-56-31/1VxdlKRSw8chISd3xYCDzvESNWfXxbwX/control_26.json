I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for dissuading a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old.\n\nFirst, GTA V has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The author detailed the graphic content like torture, sexual themes, and strong language. The mother was concerned and opted for a different game. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but the author's reasoning is that they were providing necessary information to help the parent make an informed decision.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and actions. The author was following up on the mother's request for more info, adhering to the ESRB ratings guidelines, and acting in what they believe is the best interest of the child. The co-worker's reaction seems to be more about frustration that the sale didn't go through, but the author's main responsibility is to the customer's request for accurate information. \n\nThere's no indication that the author overstepped or provided false information. The mother was given the facts and made her own decision. The author isn't in the wrong here because they were fulfilling their role of informing the customer about the product's content, which aligns with protecting the child from inappropriate material. The answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
