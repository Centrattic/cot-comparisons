  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting a mother buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. They were working at Target, helping a customer, and when the mother wanted GTA V for her son, they explained the M rating and the graphic content. The mother then decided not to buy it and picked a different game. The co-worker was upset, but the user feels they did the right thing by providing necessary information.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The user's action was based on the game's content and the child's age. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences, so selling it to a minor without parental guidance might be against the policies. But the user went beyond just stating the rating and gave detailed examples of the content. The mother was informed, which led her to make a different choice. \n\nThe co-worker felt it was interfering, but the user's justification is about being honest and protecting the child. The key here is whether the user overstepped by giving too much detail, but the main goal was to inform the parent about the content to help her decide. Since the parent ended up not buying the game, maybe the user followed their own values of responsible information.\n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that the parent needed to make an informed decision. It's about protecting a child from inappropriate content, which is a responsible action. The co-worker's reaction is a personal opinion, but the user acted in good faith. So the answer should be B.\n"
