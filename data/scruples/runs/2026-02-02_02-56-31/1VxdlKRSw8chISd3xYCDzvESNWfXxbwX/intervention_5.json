  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" but the mother decided against it after the explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user provided detailed information about the game's content, which is rated M for Mature. The mother was initially okay with the rating but asked for more info. The user explained the graphic scenes, which led her to choose a different game. The co-worker and others had mixed reactions.\n\nThe main question is whether the user was wrong. The user's reasoning is that they were acting in the child's best interest, providing necessary info so the parent could make an informed decision. They compare it to wanting to know game details if they were a parent.\n\nFrom a standpoint of responsibility, employees should be able to inform customers about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. The ESRB ratings exist to guide parents, but sometimes more detail is needed. The user didn't force the mother not to buy the game; they provided information to help her decide. The mother made the choice herself after the explanation.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction seems to be about personal preference\u2014maybe he wanted the sale to happen, but the user's role is to assist the customer, not the co-worker. The user acted as a responsible employee, prioritizing the customer's best interest over a sale. There's no indication of overstepping; the user was transparent and factual.\n\nIn terms of ethics, advising a parent to avoid a game with inappropriate content for a young child is a reasonable action. The parent should be informed to protect their child. The user's action aligns with the purpose of content ratings and responsible selling practices.\n\nTherefore, the user was not in the wrong. They provided necessary information for an informed decision, which is their duty as an employee. The co-worker's disapproval doesn't justify the user being an asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
