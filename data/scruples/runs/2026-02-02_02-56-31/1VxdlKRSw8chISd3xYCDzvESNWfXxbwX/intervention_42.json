  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling a mother about the graphic content in GTA V to dissuade her from buying it for her 9-year-old. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The user works in a store and is helping a customer. The mother wanted GTA V for her young son. The user explained the M rating and detailed the explicit content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the user for interfering, but the user feels they were just being helpful, like they'd want others to be for their own kids.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user provided accurate information about the game's content, which the mother requested. The user didn't force her not to buy it; they just informed her. The mother made the decision not to buy after being informed. \n\nIs the user overstepping or being an asshole? Well, the user's job is to help customers make informed decisions. Parents have a responsibility to know what their kids are playing, and the ESRB ratings are there for that reason. The user is just relaying the ratings and the content details. The co-worker's reaction seems to be based on the idea that the user shouldn't have influenced the purchase, but the user didn't lie or pressure the mother. They just gave honest information. \n\nIn many places, employees are encouraged to follow the ESRB guidelines and inform customers about content. The user isn't breaking any rules. The mother was grateful for the info and changed her mind. The co-worker is the one being judgmental, not the user. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They did the right thing by providing necessary information to help the parent make a decision. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
