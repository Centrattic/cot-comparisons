I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the GTA V situation is in the wrong. The person worked at Target and convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son because of the game's M rating and graphic content. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking.\" The author's reasoning is that they were just providing information so the parent could make an informed decision.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The parent was buying a game for a young child, and the employee gave a detailed explanation of the game's content. The parent then decided against buying it. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the role of the employee in advising.\n\nGTA V is rated M for Mature, which is intended for ages 17 and up. The parent was considering it for a 9-year-old, which is well below the recommended age. The employee was informing the parent about the explicit content, which is part of the ESRB rating. The employee didn't prevent the sale but provided information leading the parent to make a different choice. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is about the employee overstepping, but the employee's role in a retail setting often includes advising on product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate ratings. The employee is acting as a responsible party by educating the customer, not imposing their own values but giving necessary details. \n\nThe author's justification is based on wanting to be informed if they were in the parent's position. This is a valid point because the parent was seeking information. The employee's actions align with ethical responsibility to inform customers about content that could be unsuitable for a child's age. \n\nThere's no indication that the employee forced the decision. The parent was given a choice and acted on the information. Therefore, the employee isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
