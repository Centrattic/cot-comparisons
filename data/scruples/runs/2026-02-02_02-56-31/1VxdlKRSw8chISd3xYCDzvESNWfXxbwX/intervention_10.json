  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for persuading a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. They provided a detailed explanation of the game's content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker felt it was \"cockblocking\" and others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. GTA V has an M rating for mature audiences, which includes violence, strong language, and sexual content. The user explained the rating and specific content, which is part of their responsibility as a salesperson. The mother was seeking information, and the user provided it truthfully.\n\nThe user's intention was to inform the parent, not to make a judgment. They were helping the parent make an informed decision. The parent then chose not to buy the game, which means the user's actions led to a positive outcome in terms of protecting a child from age-inappropriate content.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction is more about personal opinion. The user isn't the parent, so they can't be blamed for the parent's decision. The user acted ethically by providing accurate information. There's no indication of overstepping or false claims. The mother was given the facts, and she made the choice based on that. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
