I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old, explaining the mature content. The colleagues had a mixed reaction.\n\nFirst, the key points: The employee provided information about the game's M rating, graphic scenes, and content. The mother was concerned and chose another game. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" but the employee feels they were just helping the parent make an informed decision.\n\nI need to determine if the employee is in the wrong. GTA V is an M-rated game, which is intended for mature audiences. The employee's role is to help customers make informed choices. There's no law against selling M-rated games to minors, but it's up to the parent's judgment. The employee didn't prevent the sale; they gave information. The mother decided not to buy after being informed.\n\nThe employee's actions seem ethical because they provided necessary info for the parent to decide. The co-worker's criticism is about not interfering, but informing isn't wrong. The parent might not know the content details, so the employee's intervention was helpful. The author's reasoning is that they would want the same for their own kids. That makes sense. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
