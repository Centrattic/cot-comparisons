  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for informing a mother about the content of GTA V to prevent her from buying it for her 9-year-old. The key points here are their responsibility as a salesperson, the age of the child, and the nature of the game's content.\n\nFirst, as an employee at Target, their role is to provide accurate information about products. GTA V has an M rating, which stands for Mature, typically for 17+. The mother was asking for more info after being told about the M rating. The user detailed the graphic content, which led the mother to choose a different game. \n\nThe co-worker criticized them for \"cockblocking,\" but the user's intent was to inform, not to make a judgment. The user's reasoning is that they'd want the same info if they were buying for their own kids. The mother was concerned and changed her purchase, which suggests the information was helpful.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's a responsibility to inform customers about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. The user didn't force the mother not to buy it; they provided facts that influenced her decision. The co-workers' mixed reactions don't necessarily make the user wrong, as different people have different views on this.\n\nSo, the user acted in a responsible manner by giving the mother the necessary information to make an informed decision. Therefore, they're not in the wrong.\n"
