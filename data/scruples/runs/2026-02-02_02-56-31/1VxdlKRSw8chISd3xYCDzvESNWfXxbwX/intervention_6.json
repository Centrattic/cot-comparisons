  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for talking a mother out of buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. The situation is that the mother wanted to get the game, which has an M rating, and the user detailed the graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decided against it. The co-worker was upset, and others had mixed reactions.\n\nHmm, the user is trying to do the right thing by informing the mother about the content. The M rating is there for a reason, indicating it's for mature audiences. GTA V is known for its mature content, so the user wasn't exaggerating. The mother was seeking information, and the user provided it. The co-worker's issue seems to be about not wanting to interfere, but the user's action was about responsible consumer information.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that if they were in the mother's position, they'd want to know the content details. That makes sense. It's about protecting the child from inappropriate material. The user isn't forcing the mother to do anything; they're just giving her more info to make an informed decision. The mother made her own choice after the information. So, the user wasn't wrong for providing the details. The co-worker's reaction is more about personal opinion, but the user's action was ethical and helpful. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
