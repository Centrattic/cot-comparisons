I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is working at Target and helps a mother who wants to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. They explain the M rating, mention graphic content like torture, sex, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decides not to buy it. The co-worker is upset, but the author thinks they did the right thing because they were informing the parent.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. GTA V is an M-rated game, which is for ages 17+. The parent is trying to buy it for a 9-year-old, which is way below the recommended age. The author provided accurate information about the content, which is their job as a game seller. They didn't force the sale but gave the parent the info to make an informed decision. The parent then chose a different game, which seems responsible. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is negative, but the author's intent was to protect a child from inappropriate content. The author argues that they'd want the same info for their own kids. Ethically, it's about protecting minors from harmful content. The author isn't the parent, but they provided the necessary information. There's no indication they pressured the mother or went beyond the M rating explanation. The M rating itself is a guideline, so the author is following standard practice. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should let the parent decide, but their role is to inform. Also, the parent might have wanted to buy the game despite the rating. However, the parent's concern after the explanation shows the info was helpful. The author isn't in the wrong here because they fulfilled their duty to inform. Co-workers being mixed isn't relevant to the rightness of the action. So, the answer is B.\n"
