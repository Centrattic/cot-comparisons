  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they were wrong for stopping a mom from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. So, the situation is they work at Target, and when a customer wanted to buy the game for her son, they gave detailed info about the mature content. The mom then decided not to buy it. The co-worker was upset, but the user is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which is typically for 17+. The mom's son is 9, which is way below that. The user explained the content, which is part of their job, especially in electronics where they handle games. Their role is to inform customers about the product they're buying, right? So, giving accurate info about the game's content is part of that duty.\n\nThe user's co-worker was upset because they felt like they were \"cockblocked,\" but the user's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. It's a common issue with parents not knowing the content of games. The user is acting as a responsible employee, ensuring that the customer is fully informed. Also, the user mentioned they would want the same for their own kids, which adds a moral standpoint.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a line where employees shouldn't make recommendations against a purchase unless they're violating company policy. But in this case, the user wasn't preventing the sale; they were just providing information. The mom made the decision herself after being informed. So, the user didn't force her not to buy it, just gave her the facts.\n\nPotential issues could be if the user overstepped by giving extra details beyond the rating, but they did mention graphic scenes which are part of the game's content. Also, the mother asked for more info, so the user was answering her questions. The mixed response from coworkers might indicate that some see it as interference, but others might agree with the approach.\n\nIn the end, the user's action seems to be in the interest of the child's well-being and providing honest information. They didn't prevent the sale but ensured the parent was aware. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
