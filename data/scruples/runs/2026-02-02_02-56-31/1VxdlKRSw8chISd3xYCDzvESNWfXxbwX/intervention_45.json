  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling a mother about the graphic content in GTA V to prevent her from buying it for her 9-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. The mother wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old, but the game has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The user explained the content, like torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decided against it.\n\nThe co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" but the user's intention was to inform the parent about the content. The user compared it to how they would want information if they were buying for their own kids.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child, the appropriateness of the content, and the role of the employee in providing accurate information. The M rating is a warning for parents, so the user was essentially reinforcing that. There's a responsibility in the electronics retail to inform customers about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction might stem from thinking that the employee overstepped, but in reality, the employee was providing necessary information that the parent asked for. The mother was the one who made the final decision after being informed. The user didn't force her not to buy it; they just gave her more details to make an educated choice.\n\nSo, the user's actions were in line with helping the parent make a responsible decision, which is in the child's best interest. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong here.\n"
