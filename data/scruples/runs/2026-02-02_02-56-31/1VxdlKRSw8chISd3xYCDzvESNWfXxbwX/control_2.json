I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, while working at Target in electronics, helped a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted GTA V, which is rated M. The author explained the graphic content, including torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided not to buy it and chose another game instead. However, the coworker was upset and called the author a \"cockblocker,\" leading to mixed reactions among other coworkers. The author is unsure if they did the right thing by preventing the sale.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's action was based on providing information about the game's content, which is age-inappropriate. The mother was given the information and made her own decision. The author's intention was to inform, not to force the decision. The M rating is there for a reason, indicating that the content is suitable for mature audiences. By explaining the graphic details, the author was fulfilling the purpose of the rating and helping the parent make an informed choice. The coworker's criticism seems to stem from a different perspective, maybe valuing the customer's autonomy or not wanting to interfere. However, the author's action aligns with responsible selling practices, especially when dealing with minors. There's no indication that the author overstepped by lying or pressuring; they simply provided facts. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because they were being honest and helpful within their role as an employee.\n"
