  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. They gave a detailed explanation of the game's content, leading the mom to choose a different game. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent asked for more info after being told about the M rating. The user provided specifics about graphic content, which is appropriate given the age. The M rating is meant to warn parents, and the store employee is just reinforcing that. \n\nThe coworker's reaction might stem from thinking the employee overstepped, but the employee was helping the parent make an informed choice. The parent's concern and decision to change the game suggests the info was useful. The user's reasoning is about protecting kids and being a responsible gatekeeper. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about protecting a child from inappropriate content versus respecting the parent's choice. However, the parent was seeking advice, so the employee's role here is to inform. The employee didn't force the decision but provided necessary details. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the employee was doing their job to inform and protect, based on the parent's inquiry. The coworker's complaint is more about personal opinion rather than wrongdoing.\n"
