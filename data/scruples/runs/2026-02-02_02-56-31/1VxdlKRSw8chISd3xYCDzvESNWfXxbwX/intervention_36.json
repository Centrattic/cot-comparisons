  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether they were in the wrong for discouraging a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the employee's role in providing information.\n\nFirst, GTA V is rated M (Mature) by the ESRB, which means it's not recommended for those under 17. The game has graphic violence, sexual content, and strong language. The mother's son is only 9, so the age is way below the recommended limit. The employee explained the content, which led the mother to decide against the purchase. The co-worker felt it was \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nThe employee's intention was to inform the parent so she could make an informed decision. The mother was asking for more information, so the employee provided it. The ESRB ratings are meant to guide parents on content, so the employee was essentially following the rating system's purpose. The employee isn't forcing the mother not to buy it, just providing facts. The co-worker's complaint seems more about not wanting the game purchase to be blocked rather than the employee's actions being wrong.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, employees are often encouraged to explain product details, especially with content ratings. The employee isn't making a personal judgment but sharing factual information. The mother used that info to make a choice, which is exactly what the ESRB system is for. Therefore, the employee isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
