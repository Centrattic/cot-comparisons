I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, working at Target, advised a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old, detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. GTA V is an M-rated game, which is for mature audiences. The parent asked for more info, and the author provided details about the content. The mother then decided not to buy it. The key here is that the author was giving information the parent requested, helping them make an informed decision.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction is about \"cockblocking,\" but the author's intent was to prevent a potentially inappropriate purchase. The author's reasoning is that they would want similar info if they were buying for their own kids. The action aligns with the parent's request for more info, so it's not misleading.\n\nPotential issues: Did the author overstep by being too graphic? But the parent asked for more information, so going into detail about the content isn't wrong. The author isn't forcing the decision but providing facts. The mother made her own choice based on that info. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
