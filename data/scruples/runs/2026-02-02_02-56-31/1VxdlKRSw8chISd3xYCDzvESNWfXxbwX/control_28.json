I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The employee gave detailed info about the game's mature content. The co-worker was upset about it, but the mother didn't buy the game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The employee's job is to help customers make informed decisions. The mother was asking for more information, so the employee provided it. GTA V has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The employee explained the content, which includes things like violence, swearing, etc. The mother then decided against buying it, which is a responsible decision.\n\nThe employee might be thinking that they were just doing their job by informing the customer. However, the co-worker felt it was \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it. But the co-worker's son is the one who wanted the game, and the mother was trying to make an educated choice. The employee wasn't forcing the mother to not buy it; they just provided the facts.\n\nAnother angle is whether the employee overstepped by giving graphic details. However, the mother explicitly asked for more information, so the employee answered truthfully. The M rating is a warning, but giving specifics helps parents understand if it's appropriate. There's no law against employees giving factual information about product content.\n\nAlso, the employee's motivation seems genuine\u2014they want to protect kids from inappropriate content. The alternative is being in the wrong by not providing enough info. The mother appreciated the info and chose another game, so the outcome was positive.\n\nThe co-worker's criticism might stem from wanting the sale to go through, but the employee's responsibility is to the customer's best interest, not the company's sales. The employee isn't in the wrong for doing their job ethically.\n"
