  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they work at Target in electronics, and they helped a mom buy a video game for her 9-year-old. The mom wanted GTA V, which is an M-rated game (M for Mature). The person explained the content, like the graphic torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online part. The mom then decided not to buy it and went for a different game. The co-worker was upset, saying the person was \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it in the break room. The person is now unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The person's intention was to provide accurate information about the game's content so the parent could make an informed decision. Parents might not know all the details of a game, especially if they're unfamiliar with it. GTA V is known for its mature content, so the person was probably doing their job by adhering to the rating guidelines. The parent ended up making a different choice because they were informed, which seems responsible.\n\nNow, the co-worker's reaction is negative, but that might be because they didn't agree with the intervention. However, the job responsibility of someone working in electronics at Target includes ensuring that customers are aware of age ratings and content descriptors. Failing to inform a parent about the game's content could be seen as neglecting that duty. The person might be following company policies or ethical standards by providing this information. \n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. In some places, there are laws about selling mature-rated games to minors. If the parent was buying for a 9-year-old, the store might not be allowed to sell it, and the employee might be required to enforce that. However, in this case, the parent was the one deciding, not the child. Still, the employee's role is to inform the parent about the content, which they did. \n\nThe co-worker's complaints might stem from a different perspective, maybe thinking that the employee overstepped. But the employee's main responsibility is to the customer, providing them with the necessary info to make a good decision. The mother was grateful and changed her decision, so the outcome was positive. \n\nIs there any harm in the employee speaking up? If the mother had bought the game without knowing, she might have been upset later. The employee prevented that by being upfront. The co-worker's frustration might be about the intervention, but the employee acted in good faith. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the employee was doing their job by informing the parent about the content, which is part of the sales process for rated products. There's no indication they forced the parent not to buy it, just provided information. The parent used that info to decide. Therefore, the employee isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
