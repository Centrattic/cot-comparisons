  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

Let me read through the details again carefully. \n\nThe user works at Target in electronics and was helping a customer buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The customer asked about GTA V. The user explained the M rating and the graphic content, including torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother then decided not to buy it and chose another game. The coworker was upset, saying it was a \"dick move,\" but others had mixed responses. The user is wondering if they did the right thing by informing the mother.\n\nFirst, GTA V is rated M for Mature by the ESRB, which is intended for ages 17 and up. The mother was buying for a 9-year-old, which is way below the recommended age. The user's role as a retail employee is to inform customers about the products they're purchasing. Providing accurate information about the content of a game is part of the job, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. \n\nThe coworker's criticism seems misplaced. The user didn't force the mother not to buy it; they provided the necessary information so she could make an informed decision. The mother made the choice herself after being informed. The user's intention was to help prevent a child from being exposed to inappropriate content, which is a responsible action. \n\nHowever, there might be a line when giving too much detail. But in this case, the user was explaining the content as part of their job to inform the customer. The mother asked for more information, so the user answered honestly. The outcome was positive\u2014the mother chose a different game. \n\nI think the user is in the right here. They provided necessary information to help the mother make a decision, which is what a responsible employee should do. The coworker's reaction was just a personal opinion and doesn't justify the user's actions being wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
