  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they were wrong for stopping a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. So, they gave detailed info about the game's content, which led the mother to choose a different game. Their co-worker called it \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The user's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which is a common concern. The game is rated M, so that's a red flag. But the user went beyond the rating and explained the graphic details. Is that necessary?\n\nThe mother was asking for more information after the M rating, so the user provided it. The mother then decided against the game. That seems responsible. But the co-worker felt it was interfering. Maybe the co-worker thought the user overstepped by giving too much detail. But the user's reasoning is that they're acting in the best interest of the child, similar to how they'd want someone to inform them if they were in a similar situation.\n\nI should check if there's a policy at Target about this. Retail employees are usually allowed to provide information about content ratings. There's no law against giving honest information about a product's content. So, the user isn't breaking any rules here.\n\nThe main question is whether the user had the right to influence the purchase. Since the customer was seeking information, the user was just being thorough. The mother made the final decision. The co-worker's criticism seems misplaced. The user is in the right because they're helping the customer make an informed choice, which aligns with the company's role in providing product info.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, not in the wrong). The user acted responsibly and within their role to inform the customer, which led to a positive outcome for the child's well-being.\n"
