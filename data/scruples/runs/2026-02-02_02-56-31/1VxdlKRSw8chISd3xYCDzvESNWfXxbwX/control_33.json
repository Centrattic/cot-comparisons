I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, the scenario is about a person working at Target in electronics. They helped a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV), which is rated M (for mature audiences). The employee explained the content, including graphic torture, sexual themes, intense swearing, and the online component. The mother then decided not to buy GTAV and chose a different game. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking\" the kid, but the employee felt they were just doing the right thing by informing the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, there are laws about selling age-rated content to minors. In the US, for example, the ESRB ratings exist, and stores can be held liable if they sell M-rated games to kids under 17 without parental consent. So, if the employee ensured the mother was aware of the content to make an informed decision, that aligns with those laws.\n\nEthically, the employee's action seems protective. The parent might not have known the game's content, so providing that information helps them make a responsible choice. The mother's concern after the explanation suggests she appreciated the information. The co-worker's criticism seems to come from a place of perhaps not valuing the importance of parental discretion, but the employee's intent was to protect the child and support the parent's decision-making.\n\nHowever, there's a possible angle where the employee could be seen as overstepping if they didn't just provide the information but actively tried to influence the decision. But in this case, the employee explained the M rating and the content as requested, which is part of the job, especially in stores that enforce age ratings. The employee didn't prevent the sale based on their own judgment but provided information that led the parent to decide against the purchase.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical standards, the employee acted appropriately. They fulfilled their responsibility to inform the parent about the game's content, which is necessary for the parent to make an informed choice. The co-worker's complaints might be based on a misunderstanding of the employee's role in this context.\n"
