  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for advising a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted the game, which has a mature rating, and the user detailed the graphic content to help her make an informed decision. The co-worker criticized them for \"cockblocking,\" and others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to inform the parent about the game's content beyond just the rating. They felt it was their job to help parents make decisions in their child's best interest. The mother ended up choosing a different game after the explanation, so the user's intervention succeeded in that regard. \n\nThe key points here are the duty of a salesperson to provide accurate information and the responsibility of a parent to make appropriate choices for their child. The user didn't force the decision but provided necessary details. The co-worker's reaction seems to be more about the user stepping in rather than the content itself, but the main issue is whether the user overstepped.\n\nIn many retail environments, employees are trained to explain game ratings and content to parents. The user went a bit further by emphasizing specific graphic elements, which could be seen as helpful or overreaching depending on the perspective. However, the mother was the one who asked for more information, so the user was responding to her request. The user's own belief is that they were doing what a parent would want\u2014to be fully informed. \n\nConsidering that the user acted in good faith and the mother made the decision based on that information, it's likely the user was in the right. The co-worker's criticism might stem from a different view on the role of the salesperson, but the user's action aligns with the expectation of providing transparency. Therefore, the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
