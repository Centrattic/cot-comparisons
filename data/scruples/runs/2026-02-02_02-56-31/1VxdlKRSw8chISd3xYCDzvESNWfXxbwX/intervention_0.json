  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for talking their coworker out of buying GTA V for her 9-year-old son. They gave a detailed explanation about the game's content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" and others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The user is an employee at Target, working in electronics. They encountered a customer (a mother) wanting to buy GTA V for her young son. The user explained the M rating, including graphic torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided against it after the user's explanation.\n\nThe user is questioning their own actions. They justify it by saying they were providing necessary information to help the mother make an informed decision, similar to how they would want someone to inform them if they were buying a game for their own kids. The main issue is whether the user overstepped by giving detailed info that led the mother to not buy the game.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, I should consider a few angles. Legally, there might be no issue since the user is just informing the customer. Ethically, it's about the role of an employee. The user's job is to assist the customer, which includes providing product information. The M rating is a standard rating system meant to inform parents about content. The user is following that by explaining the content.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the employee went beyond their role by being too detailed, even if the information is true. But the alternative is that the customer was seeking information and the employee fulfilled that need. The mother might not have known the specifics, and the employee's input could be protective.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction is about the employee interfering. But does the employee have a duty to inform? If the customer asked for more info, then providing it is part of good service. The mother was the one who made the final decision, so the employee didn't force her hand. The key here is that the employee provided factual information, not pressuring her. \n\nAlso, the user's reasoning is based on wanting to be informed if they were in the same situation. That's a common ethical stance\u2014treating others as you'd want to be treated. So from a moral standpoint, it's justified. \n\nThere's also the aspect of parental responsibility. The mother is making a decision for her child, and the employee is helping her make an informed choice. The game's content is inappropriate for a 9-year-old, and the employee is acting in the child's best interest. \n\nSo, considering all these angles, the user isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information, helped the mother make a responsible decision, and didn't overstep their role as an employee. The co-worker's frustration is more about the outcome (not getting the game) rather than the employee's duty. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
