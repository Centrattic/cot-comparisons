I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is at a Target where they work in electronics. A customer wants to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explains the mature content, like the graphic scenes, and the mother decides not to buy it. But the co-worker is upset, saying it's \"cockblocking\" and making a big deal. The author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which typically means 17+. The mother asked for more information, so the author gave her details about the content. The mother then changed her mind. That sounds like the author was just doing their job, providing information so the parent can make an informed decision. \n\nBut maybe the author overstepped by being too graphic? The question is whether detailing the scenes was necessary. However, the mother specifically asked for more info after the M rating. So explaining the content in detail might be appropriate to help her understand why it's rated that way. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is part of the question. The author's co-worker is upset, but the author's perspective is that they were just being honest. The author's reasoning is that if they were in the parent's position, they'd want to know. So they were acting in the parent's best interest.\n\nI think the key points here are: the author provided information upon the parent's request, the game's content is age-inappropriate for a 9-year-old, and the author's intention was to help the parent make a decision. The co-worker's disapproval might stem from thinking the author interfered, but the author was just doing their job to inform. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
