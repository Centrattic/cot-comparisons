  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is working at Target in electronics and helped a mother who wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The user explained the game's M rating and detailed the more graphic content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker was upset about this, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" and others had mixed reactions. The user is now questioning if they were the asshole for doing this.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to inform the mother about the game's content so she could make an educated decision. GTA V does have explicit content, which is age-inappropriate for a 9-year-old. The ESRB M rating is meant for mature audiences, typically 17+. The user is following their own moral compass here, trying to prevent a child from being exposed to unsuitable material.\n\nHowever, the co-worker's reaction suggests that some might see the user as overstepping. The user provided more details than the mother might have asked for, which could be seen as intrusive. But the mother did ask for more information, so the user was answering honestly. The key here is whether the user crossed a line by being too graphic. The user mentioned a \"plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing,\" and \"online aspect.\" The online part is important because it adds another layer of potential risks.\n\nThe user's argument is that they were doing what they would want for their own kids. That's a common ethical stance, prioritizing the well-being of children. But some might argue that the user shouldn't impose their values on others, even if those values are about protecting children. However, the mother did ask for more info, so the user was being helpful in that context.\n\nThe ESRB rating system exists to inform parents about content, and the user is acting as an extension of that system. The real issue is whether the user had the right to influence the mother's decision. Since the mother made the choice after being informed, the user didn't force her; they just provided facts. The mother could have still chosen to buy it, but she opted out after understanding the content.\n\nIn this scenario, the user's actions seem justified. They're not the asshole for providing necessary information that leads to a protective decision. The co-worker's reaction is more about personal annoyance rather than a valid ethical concern. The user isn't in the wrong because they're advocating for responsible gaming choices, aligning with the ESRB guidelines and the parent's best interest in protecting their child.\n"
