I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author working at Target in the electronics department, helping a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The author convinced her not to buy GTA V because of its M rating and graphic content, leading her to choose a different game. The co-worker and some others in the break room had mixed reactions, with some calling it \"cockblocking.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author provided detailed information about the game's content, which the mother asked for. The mother then decided not to buy GTA V after being informed. The question is whether the author overstepped or was just doing the right thing by giving accurate information.\n\nThe key points here are the responsibility of the store employee to inform customers about product content. The M rating stands for \"Mature\" and is meant for ages 17 and up. The author explained that the game has graphic content, which is part of the rating. By providing this information, the author is helping the mother make an informed decision, which seems responsible. The mother might not have known the specifics, so the author's actions align with being helpful.\n\nHowever, the co-worker's reaction suggests there's a debate about whether the author was too direct or overstepping. But in the scenario, the mother explicitly asked for more information, so the author's response was appropriate. The author didn't force the decision; the mother made her own choice after being informed. The author's motivation was to prevent a child from being exposed to age-inappropriate content, which is a valid concern.\n\nThere's also the aspect of parental guidance. The author is acting as a mediator, ensuring that the parent has all necessary information to decide what's best for their child. The author's reasoning that they would want the same for their own kids if they had any adds to the argument that their intent was positive.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author shouldn't take it upon themselves to influence the customer's decision, even if it's well-intentioned. But the mother did ask for more details, so the author was just fulfilling that request. The author didn't lie or exaggerate; they presented factual information about the game's content.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided accurate information in response to the customer's question, which allowed the mother to make an informed decision. The co-worker's criticism seems to stem from a different perspective, possibly valuing the customer's autonomy over the child's exposure to content, but the author's actions were responsible and appropriate.\n"
