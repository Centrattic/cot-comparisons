I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for providing detailed information about the graphic content in GTA V to a mother buying a game for her 9-year-old son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The OP works at Target in electronics. A customer comes in to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The OP explains the M rating, mentions graphic torture, sexual content, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decides not to buy it. The co-worker was with OP during the sale and later criticized OP for \"cockblocking\" the kid, leading to some mixed reactions among coworkers.\n\nThe main question is whether OP overstepped by giving such detailed info. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI should consider a few factors. Legally and ethically, stores are supposed to inform customers about age ratings. GTA V is rated M (Mature), which is for 17+ according to ESRB. So, the parent is making a purchase that's against the rating. The OP is helping the parent make an informed decision by explaining the content. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The parent asked for more information, so the OP provided it. The parent then chose not to buy the game. The co-worker's reaction is that OP was being a \"dick\" by blocking the purchase. But the parent might have been unaware of the actual content, and the OP's actions could be seen as responsible, especially if the parent is making a decision based on incomplete info.\n\nAnother angle is the role of the employee. If the job is to inform customers about the game's content, then the OP is doing their job. The ESRB rating is a guideline, but it's up to the parent to decide. However, the employee didn't prevent the sale; they just provided info. The parent made the final decision to not buy it after being informed.\n\nThe co-worker's criticism might be based on the idea that the kid should be allowed to play the game, but the parent's responsibility is to decide what's appropriate. The OP's reasoning is that they'd want the same information if they were buying for their own kids. That seems reasonable.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the OP gave too much detail, but the parent asked for more. Also, the parent might have known the content and still wanted the game. However, the parent said they knew nothing about it, so the info was necessary.\n\nIn terms of ethics and responsibility, the employee's action seems justified. They provided information that the parent requested, allowing her to make an informed choice. The parent's decision not to buy the game is her prerogative. The co-worker's reaction is perhaps misunderstanding the parent's right to choose based on content details.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
