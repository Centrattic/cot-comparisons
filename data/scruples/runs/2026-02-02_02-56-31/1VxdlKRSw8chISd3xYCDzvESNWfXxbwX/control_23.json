I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The situation is that the author works at Target, helped the mother, explained the M rating and the graphic content, and the mother decided against it. The co-worker was upset, but the author thinks they were just doing what they'd want if they were the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the kid. 9 years old is pretty young. GTA V has a mature rating, which is meant for teens 17 and older. The game has violence, swearing, sexual content, etc. The mother was told about these aspects, which she probably wasn't aware of. The author's job is to help customers make informed decisions. By giving the mother accurate information, the author was acting in the best interest of the child, even if it meant not making a sale. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is understandable but maybe they don't see the bigger picture. The author didn't force the mother to not buy the game; they provided info, and the mother made the choice. The author isn't in the wrong for doing their job and giving a warning. The key here is that the author wasn't making a judgment but informing. The mother's decision was her own. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
