  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The situation is that the user detailed the graphic content to the mom, who then decided against it. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"cockblocking,\" and others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The user's intention was to inform the parent about the game's content so she can make an educated decision. The game has an M rating, which is for mature audiences, so the user explained the reasons behind that rating. The parent was concerned and chose a different game, which seems like a positive outcome in terms of child safety.\n\nOn the flip side, the co-worker felt it was a \"dick move,\" implying that maybe the user overstepped. But the user's role at Target is to assist customers, and providing accurate information about product content is part of good customer service. The user isn't forcing the sale; they're giving information to help the customer make an informed choice. The parent had the final say, and she chose not to buy the game after being informed. \n\nThere's also a legal aspect. Retailers are allowed to provide information about content ratings. The ESRB ratings exist to help parents make decisions, and by informing the parent, the user is acting in line with those guidelines. The user didn't lie or manipulate; they provided facts. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction might stem from a different perspective, perhaps thinking that the customer should decide without interference. However, the user's motive was to protect a child from inappropriate content, which is a valid concern. The mother was appreciative of the information, indicating that the user did the right thing from her standpoint.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the user isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information to help a parent make a decision in her child's best interest. The answer should be B.\n"
