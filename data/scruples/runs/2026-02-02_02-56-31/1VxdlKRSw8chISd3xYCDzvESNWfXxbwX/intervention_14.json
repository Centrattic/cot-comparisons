  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for discouraging a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. The mother asked for more info, and the user gave a detailed explanation of the graphic content. The mother then decided not to buy it. The co-worker was upset about it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user provided information about the game's content, which is a mature-rated game. The mother was informed, and she made her own decision. The user's co-worker felt like they were blocking the sale, but the user's intention was to protect a child from inappropriate content.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, I think the user is in the right. The game has an M rating for a reason, and it's their job to inform customers about the content. The user didn't force the mother not to buy it; they just gave her the facts. The mother then chose not to buy it, which is her right as a parent. The co-worker's reaction seems more about the loss of a sale than the child's well-being. So, the answer should be B.\n"
