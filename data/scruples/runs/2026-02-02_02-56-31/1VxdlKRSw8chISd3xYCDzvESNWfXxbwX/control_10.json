I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an employee at Target who advised a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son because of its mature content. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" but the employee feels they were just doing the right thing by informing the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The employee provided information about the game's content beyond just the ESRB rating. The mother was initially considering buying it for her young child, and after the employee's detailed explanation, she changed her mind. The employee's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which seems reasonable. However, the employee's co-worker felt it was overstepping their role.\n\nNow, the question is whether the employee is in the wrong. Retail employees often have the discretion to recommend or warn about products, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. The ESRB rating is there for a reason, but sometimes parents might not fully understand what the ratings mean. By explaining the graphic elements\u2014like torture scenes, sexual themes, and swearing\u2014the employee is giving the parent more context to make an informed decision. That seems like a responsible action.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the employee shouldn't have gone beyond just stating the rating. They might say it's the parent's choice and that the employee is overstepping. However, the parent was asking for more information, and the employee answered truthfully. The mother was then able to make a choice based on accurate information, which is part of the customer service role.\n\nAnother angle is the employee's motivation. They mentioned they would want the same information if they were a parent, which aligns with the principle of transparency and ethical behavior. The employee's action was in the best interest of the child and the parent's decision-making process. There's no indication of malice or bias; it's about providing necessary details.\n\nThe co-workers' mixed reactions don't necessarily validate that the employee was wrong. Different people have different views on how much to intervene in such situations, but from a parental responsibility and ethical standpoint, the employee's action seems justified. The parent ultimately decided against the purchase, which is the desired outcome if the game is inappropriate for the child's age.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the employee was not in the wrong. They provided valuable information to help a parent make a better decision, which is part of their role in a customer service position. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
