I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker felt that the employee was \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it. The author is questioning their own actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The employee is doing their job by providing accurate information about the game's content. They mentioned the M rating, which is a standard practice. The mother asked for more information, so the employee gave it. The mother then decided not to buy it, which seems like a responsible decision. The co-worker is upset because they think the employee overstepped, but the author's intention was to protect a child from inappropriate content.\n\nI should think about ethical standards here. The employee is in a position where they have knowledge about the products they sell. It's their responsibility to inform customers, especially when the product might not be suitable for certain age groups. The mother had the right to know the content details to make an informed choice. The author's argument is that they would want the same level of detail if they were buying for their own kids, which is a valid perspective.\n\nHowever, there's a potential concern about overstepping. The employee might have shared more graphic details than necessary, but since the mother asked for more information, it's reasonable to assume she wanted a thorough explanation. The mixed responses from coworkers suggest some might think the employee was too direct, but others might agree with their approach. \n\nIn terms of company policy, Target probably encourages employees to provide accurate product information. The employee didn't force the mother not to buy the game; they presented the facts and let her make the decision. The mother chose to buy a different game, so the employee's action led to a positive outcome. \n\nThe co-worker's \"dick move\" comment seems to stem from a desire for the child to play the game, but that doesn't justify not providing the necessary information. The author's intention was protective, which aligns with common parental concerns. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that the mother requested, leading to a responsible purchasing decision. The answer should be B.\n"
