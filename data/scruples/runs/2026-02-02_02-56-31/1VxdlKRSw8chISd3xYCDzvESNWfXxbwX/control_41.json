I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the game's graphic content. The co-worker felt it was a \"dick move,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that they were providing the mother with necessary information to make an informed decision. GTA V does have an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The employee mentioned graphic torture, sexual content, and strong language. These are all part of the game's content that could be inappropriate for a young child. The mother was concerned and chose a different game, which seems to align with the author's intention to help.\n\nThe co-worker's criticism is that the author was \"cockblocking\" the purchase, but that's more about the method than the intent. The key here is whether providing accurate information about a product's content is the employee's responsibility. Retail employees often give advice on products, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. For example, if a child wanted to buy a game with violent content, an employee pointing that out would be doing their job.\n\nThe mixed responses from coworkers suggest that there's no clear consensus, but the author's motivation seems genuine. They were trying to act in the best interest of the child's well-being, not just to block a sale. The author also mentions that they would want similar information if they were in the mother's position. This adds a layer of empathy and selflessness to their actions.\n\nPotential counterarguments could be that the employee overstepped by being too graphic in their description. However, the ESRB rating details are publicly available, and the employee was simply conveying those details when asked. The mother explicitly asked for more information after hearing the M rating, so the employee was fulfilling her request.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that helped the parent make an informed decision, which is a responsible action. The co-worker's reaction might stem from a different perspective, but the author's intent was appropriate. Answer B.\n"
