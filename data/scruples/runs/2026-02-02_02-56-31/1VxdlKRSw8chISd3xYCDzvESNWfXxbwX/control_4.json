I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author worked at Target and convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the game's graphic content. The co-worker was upset about this, and the author is unsure if they were the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author provided detailed information about the game's content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The main question is whether the author overstepped their role as a salesperson.\n\nIn retail, part of the job is to inform customers about products, including age-appropriate ratings. The ESRB rating for GTA V is M for Mature, which is 17+. The author explained the content, which is their duty. However, the author went beyond just stating the rating and gave more graphic details. That might be where the line is crossed. While the intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, the method could be seen as overreaching. The co-worker's complaint was about \"cockblocking,\" implying the author was interfering without the mother's consent. \n\nBut on the other hand, the mother asked for more information, so the author was responding to her request. The author might have thought they were helping by providing the necessary details for an informed decision. However, the author might have assumed the mother wasn't capable of making that decision herself, which could be paternalistic. The mother could have felt disrespected if the author didn't trust her judgment. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that if they were in a similar situation, they'd want to know. But maybe the author should have just provided the rating and let the mother decide, rather than adding extra details. The ESRB rating system is designed so that parents can make their own choices based on their kids' maturity. By over-explaining, the author might have influenced the decision rather than just informing it. \n\nIn terms of company policy, maybe the store allows employees to discuss content details, but it's possible that the author went beyond the standard procedure. However, the primary issue is about ethics and the author's right to influence the purchase. The mother might have been capable of making the decision with just the rating. The author's actions could be seen as well-intentioned but overstepping, hence making them the asshole. However, if the store encourages employees to inform parents about content, then it's appropriate. \n\nConsidering all this, the balance is between the author's good intentions and the potential overstep. Since the mother asked for more info, the author answered honestly, but the co-worker's reaction suggests that some might see it as interfering. However, the mother didn't express anger, just changed her purchase. The author's actions were based on concern for the child's welfare, which is generally seen as positive. \n\nI think the correct answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They were providing necessary information upon request, and the mother made a decision based on that. The co-worker's complaint might be about the method, but the author's intent was to help. Parents are expected to make informed choices, and the employee's role here was to assist in that. So, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
