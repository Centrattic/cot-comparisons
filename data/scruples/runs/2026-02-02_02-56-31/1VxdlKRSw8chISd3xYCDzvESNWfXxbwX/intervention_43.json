  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for stopping a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. They gave a detailed explanation about the game's content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker was upset and talked about it with others, but responses were mixed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The user worked at Target, helped a customer, and provided information about the game's content, which led the mom to change her mind. The user's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. The mother was initially unaware, and the user felt it was their duty to inform her, similar to how they would want someone to inform them if they were in a similar situation.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, warning someone about the content of a product they're buying for a child seems responsible. Parents have a duty to protect their children from age-inappropriate material, and the user might be acting in the child's best interest. However, the co-worker felt it was an overstep, possibly intruding on the customer's choice. But the user's action was based on providing accurate information, not pressuring the sale. The mother made the decision herself after being informed, so the user didn't force her hand.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. The user was doing their job by giving a detailed explanation of the product's content, which is part of customer service. Ethically, it's about balancing customer autonomy with protecting children. Since the mother was the one who decided not to buy it after being informed, the user isn't overriding her choice but providing necessary info.\n\nIn similar scenarios, employees often give content warnings for games, movies, etc. For example, a video store clerk might mention the violent content of a movie to a customer buying it for a child. That's generally considered helpful, not an asshole move. The user's actions align with that. The co-worker's frustration might stem from not seeing the importance of the content warnings, but the user acted in good faith.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B. The user wasn't wrong; they were helping the mother make an informed decision.\n"
