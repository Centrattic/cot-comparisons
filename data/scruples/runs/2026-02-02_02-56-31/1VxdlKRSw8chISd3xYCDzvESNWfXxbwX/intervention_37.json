  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for advising a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted to buy the game, which has an M rating (for mature audiences). The user detailed the graphic content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the user for \"cockblocking\" the son. The user's reasoning is that they were providing necessary information to help the mother make an informed decision, similar to how they would want to know if buying a game for their own kids.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the user acted appropriately. The key points here are the responsibility of a salesperson in informing customers about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences by the ESRB, which includes violence, language, and sexual content. The user mentioned specific elements like torture scenes, sexual themes, and swearing. These are significant factors in the ESRB rating.\n\nThe mother was seeking information because she wasn't sure about the game's content. By providing a detailed explanation, the user was fulfilling their role in helping her make an informed choice. The ESRB rating is meant to guide consumers, but the user went beyond just stating the rating and explained the specific content. This could be seen as proactive in ensuring that the parent understands the game's suitability for their child's age.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker's criticism suggests that the user overstepped by actively dissuading the purchase rather than just stating the rating. However, the user's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which aligns with the ESRB's purpose. The mother ultimately decided not to buy GTA V, which indicates that the information was valuable to her.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the user's action can be viewed as responsible, especially given the age of the child (9 years old) and the content of the game. The user is advocating for age-appropriate purchasing decisions, which is a common expectation in retail, particularly for sensitive content. There's no indication that the user coerced the mother, just that they provided necessary information leading to her decision.\n\nPotential counterarguments might involve the co-worker's perspective that the user shouldn't influence the customer's choice. However, the user's role is to inform, not to dictate. Since the mother asked for more information and the user provided it, the decision ultimately rested with her. The user isn't wrong for ensuring the mother was fully aware of the content, especially when it comes to a young child.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's actions were appropriate and in line with ethical sales practices, especially considering the importance of child safety and age-appropriate content. They provided necessary information without overstepping, allowing the customer to make an informed decision.\n"
