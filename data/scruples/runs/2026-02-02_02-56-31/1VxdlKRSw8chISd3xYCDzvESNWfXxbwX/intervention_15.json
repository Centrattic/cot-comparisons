  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for dissuading a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. They provided detailed info about the game's content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The coworker criticized them, but others had mixed responses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The user's intention was to protect a child from inappropriate content. GTA V has an M rating for mature audiences, which includes violence, strong language, and sexual content. A 9-year-old is well below the recommended age. By informing the mother, the user acted in what they believed was the child's best interest. \n\nNext, the role of a salesperson. Isn't part of their job to provide accurate information about products? The user was fulfilling their duty to inform the customer about the game's content. The mother asked for more information, so the user provided it honestly. They didn't force her to buy something else; they just gave her the facts, which she then used to make a decision.\n\nHowever, the coworker's reaction might stem from a different perspective. Maybe they saw it as overstepping, but the user wasn't violating any company policy. They were following standard practice of informing customers. The mother was grateful and changed her decision, which shows the user's intervention had a positive effect.\n\nIs there a line crossed here? If the user had lied or manipulated the information, that would be different. But they were truthful and professional. The key point is that the user respected the parent's autonomy by giving them the necessary info to make an informed choice. The mother chose not to buy GTA V after being informed, so the user's action was supportive, not controlling.\n\nIn conclusion, the user did the right thing by providing necessary information to help a parent make a responsible decision. They are not in the wrong here.\n"
