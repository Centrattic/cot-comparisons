I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, working at Target, helped a mother buy a video game. The kid is 9, and the mother was buying Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV), which has an M rating. The author explained the graphic content like torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided not to buy it after that. The co-worker thought the author was being a dick, but the author feels they were just doing the right thing by informing the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the US, the ESRB ratings are a guideline to help parents make informed decisions. The store employees are allowed to discuss the content ratings, right? They aren't supposed to give a detailed breakdown of the content, but the author did explain the graphic elements. Wait, but there's a policy called \"content disclosure\" where employees are trained not to describe the specific content beyond the rating. If the author violated that policy, maybe they're at fault. But if they just provided the rating and basic info, then it's okay.\n\nBut the mother asked for more information, so maybe the author went beyond the standard response. However, the author's intention was to help the mother make an informed choice. The M rating is for mature audiences, so GTAV is intended for 17+. The parent might not realize the severity of the content, especially since the rating might be familiar but the specifics are unknown.\n\nThe co-worker was annoyed because the kid was going to get the game, but the author's action prevented that. The author's reasoning is that they would want the same information if buying for their own kids. It's a proactive approach. However, maybe the store has policies against giving too much detail to avoid liability or to respect the parent's decision. If the mother is capable of making her own decision, even if she might regret it, the employee's role is to provide the rating and maybe a brief summary. But if the mother asked for more, the employee might be allowed to elaborate, depending on the company's stance.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't the parent. It's their job to inform customers. If the store allows employees to discuss content, then it's okay. If not, maybe the author overstepped. But the main question is whether the author was wrong. The mother was informed and made a choice. The author's actions led to a positive outcome in preventing a purchase that might not be age-appropriate. The co-worker's reaction is more about not wanting the kid to miss out, but the author is protecting the child's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information to help the parent make a decision. Even if the co-worker is upset, the author was doing their job responsibly. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
