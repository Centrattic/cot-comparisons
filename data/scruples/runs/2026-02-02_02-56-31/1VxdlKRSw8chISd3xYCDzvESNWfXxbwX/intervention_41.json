  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for helping a mother decide against buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. They provided a detailed explanation of the game's content, like torture scenes, sexual themes, and swearing. The mother was concerned and chose a different game. The coworker felt like they were \"cockblocked\" and talked about it, but responses were mixed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The mother was buying for a 9-year-old, and GTA V is rated M, which is for mature audiences. The user was informing her about the content. It's their job to help customers make informed decisions, right? But maybe they went overboard with the graphic details? However, the mother asked for more info and the user was just explaining the ESRB rating. The coworker's reaction might be more about not wanting to be corrected than anything else. The user's reasoning is that they'd want the same info if they were buying for their own kids. That makes sense because parents have different thresholds for content. The user didn't force the mother not to buy the game, they just provided facts. So, they were probably doing their job ethically by ensuring the customer knew the game's content. The coworker's comment is probably just a joke but could reflect a different perspective. The mixed response from others suggests that some might think the user was overstepping, but others agree it's right to inform. The key here is the mother's intent to buy for a child under 16-18, and the user helping her make a safer choice. ESRB ratings are meant to guide parents, so the user was acting in line with that. They didn't do anything illegal or against company policy as far as I can tell. So, I think the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
