I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they worked at Target and convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the game's graphic content. The co-worker was upset about it, but the mother ended up buying a different game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main question is about whether the author overstepped their bounds. The author's intention was to protect the child by informing the mother about the game's mature content. GTA V is an M-rated game, which means it's intended for mature audiences. The author mentioned explicit details like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother was concerned after the explanation and changed her purchase.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were providing necessary information so the mother could make an informed decision. They also compare it to wanting to know the content if they were buying a game for their own kids. The co-worker, on the other hand, felt it was a \"dick move\" and made a big deal about it with other coworkers.\n\nNow, considering the potential wrongdoings. The author could be seen as overstepping if they went beyond just explaining the M rating and provided unnecessary graphic details. However, the mother explicitly asked for more information, so the author answered truthfully. The M rating is a standard rating system, and the author's role in a retail position is to inform customers about the product. The concern is that by detailing the graphic scenes, the author might have influenced the mother's decision more than necessary, but since the mother chose to buy another game, it's possible she appreciated the information.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker's reaction is based on personal opinion. The author's actions seem to be in line with ethical responsibility, ensuring that a parent is fully aware of content that might not be suitable for a child. The author isn't forcing the mother to not buy the game but is giving her the facts to decide. There's no indication that the author pressured the mother, just provided detailed info upon her request.\n\nPossible counterpoints: some might argue that the author should have just mentioned the rating and not gone into graphic details. However, since the mother asked for more information, the author's response is appropriate. The key here is that the author didn't lie or withhold information; they gave her the facts she asked for, which led her to make a different choice.\n\nIn terms of general societal norms, protecting children from inappropriate content is widely accepted. Retail employees are expected to inform customers about age ratings and content. The author's actions align with that expectation. The co-worker's criticism is more about personal discomfort rather than a valid ethical issue. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted responsibly by providing necessary information, allowing the mother to make an informed decision. The fact that the mother ended up not buying the game shows that the information was helpful. The co-worker's reaction is an example of differing opinions but doesn't make the author the asshole.\n"
