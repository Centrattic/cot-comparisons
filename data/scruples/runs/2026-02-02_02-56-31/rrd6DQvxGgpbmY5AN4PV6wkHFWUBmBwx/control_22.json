The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the scenario is that the author's girlfriend was talking about a psychology experiment she learned. The author said the conclusion was obvious, and the girlfriend felt hurt because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author doesn't think they did anything wrong and refuses to apologize, saying they don't care if others are offended and that the girlfriend shouldn't get worked up over little things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key issue is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even though the author didn't mean it in a snarky way, the word itself often comes off as dismissive. The girlfriend felt it was offensive, which the author is dismissing by saying others wouldn't be offended. The author is also invalidating her feelings by claiming they shouldn't have been hurt and that the girlfriend needs to \"get over it.\"\n\nCommunication in relationships is about respecting each other's feelings. Even if the author thinks the conclusion was obvious, the way they expressed it could be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her experience of learning something new was belittled. The author's refusal to acknowledge her feelings and insistence that she's overreacting suggests a lack of empathy. \n\nIn many cases, the word \"obviously\" is considered a communication red flag because it can make others feel their knowledge or understanding is questioned. The author's defense that the conclusion is well-known might not matter to the person who's in the process of learning it. The girlfriend's perspective is that at the time she learned it, it wasn't obvious to her, so the author's comment could make her feel that her effort or learning journey was undervalued.\n\nThe author also mentions not caring that she got hurt and telling her to not get offended over small things. This approach is not about the size of the issue but about how people perceive and feel. In healthy relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings rather than dismiss them. By not apologizing and arguing that the girlfriend is overreacting, the author is likely contributing to the problem rather than resolving it.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions, even if unintended, hurt the girlfriend's feelings. The way they responded to her feelings by invalidating them is problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
