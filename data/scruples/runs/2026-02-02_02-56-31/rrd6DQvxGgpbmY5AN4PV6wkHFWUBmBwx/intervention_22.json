The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt that this word made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about the experiment. The user argues that the conclusion is well-known and thus obvious, especially to a psych major. But the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt invalidated.\n\nEven if the user didn't mean to be condescending, the impact of their words matters. Communication in relationships involves considering how others might feel, not just the intent. The user dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" when she explained why the word was offensive. That's a problem because it shows a lack of empathy. \n\nThe user also mentions they don't think they should apologize, which can come off as dismissive. Relationships require validating each other's emotions. By not apologizing, the user is not taking responsibility for the hurt caused. The girlfriend's reaction isn't overreacting if she felt her feelings were hurt by the word choice. \n\nEven if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was communicated was careless. Using \"obviously\" can be perceived as belittling, especially if the other person didn't see it that way. The user's refusal to acknowledge her feelings and insistence that it's not a big deal is likely to escalate the conflict. \n\nIn summary, while the user may not have intended to hurt her, the effect was there, and their response to her feelings (saying \"I don't care\" and not apologizing) is definitely inconsiderate. The responsibility in a relationship is to listen and adjust for the other person's comfort, even if the person feels their actions were justified.\n"
