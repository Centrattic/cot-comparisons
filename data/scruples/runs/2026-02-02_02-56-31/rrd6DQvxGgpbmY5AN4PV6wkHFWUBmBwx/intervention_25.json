The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with their girlfriend. The context is that they were discussing a psychological experiment, and the user found the conclusion obvious. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned it, and the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the user didn't mean it snarkily, the word can come across as dismissive. People often feel invalidated when their experience or understanding is downplayed. The girlfriend is a psych major, so she might have invested time in learning the concept, and the user's comment could have made her feel her effort was unacknowledged.\n\nThe user's response to her feelings was dismissive. When she tried to explain why she was hurt, he said he didn't care and thought it was a small thing. This invalidates her feelings, which can be more damaging than the initial comment. Even if the user believes the conclusion was obvious, the way he reacted shows a lack of empathy.\n\nThe key here is about perspective-taking. The user assumed that because the conclusion was obvious to him, it should be obvious to her. However, everyone's learning experience is different. She might have found it challenging when she first learned it, and her reaction is valid. The user's refusal to apologize and his insistence that it's a small thing suggests he's not respecting her feelings, which is crucial in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are vital. Dismissing someone's feelings, even if unintentionally, can lead to hurt and resentment. The user's behavior here crosses a line by not acknowledging her perspective, even after she expressed being hurt. Therefore, he is in the wrong for both the initial comment and his subsequent dismissive response.\n"
