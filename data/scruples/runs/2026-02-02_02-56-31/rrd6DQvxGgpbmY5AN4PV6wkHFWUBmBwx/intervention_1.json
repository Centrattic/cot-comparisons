The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were discussing an experiment, and the user said the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt offended because she didn't find it obvious at first and it made her feel dumb. The user argues that since it's a well-known concept, it was obvious to her as a psych major. The girlfriend is upset, and the user is resisting apologizing, thinking it's a small issue.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The user's point is that the conclusion was indeed obvious and they didn't mean to be dismissive. The girlfriend's perspective is that using \"obviously\" made her feel invalidated, especially since she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. \n\nUsing the word \"obviously\" can come off as condescending, even if not intended. Even if the user didn't mean to be snarky, the impact on the girlfriend was negative. Relationships often require considering the other person's feelings, even if the intent was neutral. The user's refusal to apologize and dismissive attitude (\"I don't care,\" \"get over it\") might be the bigger issue here. \n\nThe key points are: Did the user's actions hurt her feelings, and does that make them wrong? Even if the user didn't mean to, the fact that it caused hurt feelings matters. The user's response of not caring about her feelings and telling her to get over it suggests a lack of empathy, which is a red flag. Apologizing isn't just about being wrong, but about respecting her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. The user might not see it as a big deal, but the fact that they're in a relationship means that mutual respect and consideration are necessary. Saying \"I don't think I should have to apologize\" shows a lack of willingness to see her perspective, which could be seen as being in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the user didn't intend to be offensive, their use of \"obviously\" and their dismissive response to her feelings are problematic. The answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because they didn't consider the impact of their words and responded in a way that invalidated her feelings.\n"
