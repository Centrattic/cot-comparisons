The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment she mentioned. She's a psych major, and he thought the conclusion was obvious, so he said it was obvious. She felt that made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the conclusion is common knowledge, using that word can come off as dismissive. People can feel belittled when their understanding of something is questioned, even if the speaker didn't mean any harm. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling stupid, which is a common emotional response to being told something is obvious when you didn't see it that way.\n\nThe user argues that it was safe to assume the conclusion was obvious to her since she's a psych major. But that's an assumption. Just because the conclusion is well-known doesn't mean everyone grasps its implications immediately. People's educational experiences vary; maybe she learned the experiment in a way that made the conclusion less obvious to her at the time. Or perhaps the context in which she learned it was different.\n\nHe also said \"I don't care\" when she explained why the word was offensive. That's a red flag. Even if he doesn't fully agree, dismissing her feelings as unimportant is a breach of emotional support. Relationships require validating each other's feelings, even if you don't see the issue the same way. By not acknowledging her hurt and insisting she shouldn't get worked up over \"little things,\" he's not showing empathy.\n\nThe fact that he's waiting for her to get over it suggests a lack of willingness to compromise. Communication in relationships is two-way; both parties need to adjust and understand each other's sensitivities. His stance that he doesn't need to apologize because he didn't mean to hurt her is a classic case of not taking responsibility for the emotional impact of his words. Intent vs. impact is a common dynamic here. Even if his intent was neutral, the impact was hurtful.\n\nAdditionally, the way he frames the situation as \"not a big thing\" minimizes her feelings. What's a small thing to one person can be significant to another. It's about respect and consideration. Using \"obviously\" might seem trivial, but the effect it had on her is valid. Relationships often require navigating such differences in communication styles and sensitivities.\n\nIn summary, while the user might not have intended to be hurtful, his use of the word \"obviously\" and his dismissive response to her feelings likely contributed to the conflict. The key points are the impact of his words, the lack of validation for her feelings, and the unwillingness to apologize, which are all signs that he's in the wrong. So, the answer would be A.\n"
