The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt offended and thought the user was making her feel dumb. The user defends their use of the word by saying the conclusion was obvious and that as a psych major, the girlfriend should have known it. They also mention not caring about her feelings in the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of using \"obviously.\" Even if the user didn't mean it snarkily, the term can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend was a psych major, but she might not have known that the conclusion was well-known. People can take different amounts of time to grasp concepts, and what's obvious to one person might not be to another, even in the same field. \n\nThe user's response to the girlfriend's feelings is important. When she expressed being hurt, the user didn't apologize and even said \"I don't care,\" which shows a lack of empathy. Acknowledging her feelings is crucial in a relationship. Dismissing her reaction as a \"big thing\" or telling her to \"get over it\" isn't supportive. \n\nThe key points are: using language that can be perceived as condescending, not validating her feelings, and refusing to apologize. Even if the user didn't intend harm, the effect on the girlfriend matters. The fact that she felt stupid and hurt indicates that the user's words had a negative impact. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are vital. The user's insistence on their own perspective without considering the girlfriend's emotional response suggests they're not taking responsibility for their part. It's not just about the word \"obviously\" but how they handled the situation afterward. \n\nTherefore, the user is likely in the wrong. They should have chosen their words more carefully and shown more understanding when their girlfriend expressed her feelings.\n"
