The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault (AITA). The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with his girlfriend, which she found offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author said the experiment's conclusion was obvious and used the word \"obviously,\" which the girlfriend took as a personal slight, making her feel dumb. He argues that since the conclusion is well-known and she's a psych major, it should have been obvious to her. However, she felt it wasn't obvious to her at the time she learned it.\n\nThe main issue here is the use of \"obviously.\" Even if the conclusion is indeed obvious to the author, using that word can come off as dismissive or condescending. People often find that word offensive because it implies the other person should know something without explanation, which can make them feel incompetent. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were hurt, and she's a psych major, so she might be sensitive to how communication affects others.\n\nThe author's response is to dismiss her feelings, stating that he doesn't care that she's offended. This is problematic because it invalidates her emotional response. Even if he didn't mean to be offensive, the impact of his words matters. Acknowledging her feelings and apologizing would have been a more empathetic approach. By instead telling her not to get offended over \"little things,\" he's not taking her feelings seriously, which can damage the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's failure to recognize the potential hurt caused by his words and his dismissive attitude towards her feelings suggest he is in the wrong. The fact that she felt the need to explain why \"obviously\" is offensive and he still refused to apologize shows a lack of willingness to understand her perspective. So, the answer is A.\n"
