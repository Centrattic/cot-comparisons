The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when talking about a psychology experiment with their girlfriend. They thought the conclusion was obvious, but she felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider how using \"obviously\" can come off. Even if the user didn't mean to be condescending, the word itself often implies that the other person should know something, which might make them feel inadequate. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she expected to know it, but she didn't. The user's comment could have made her feel like she was wrong or not as smart.\n\nThen, the user dismisses her feelings, saying they don't care and that she should just get over it. That's definitely not good. Even if they don't agree with her being hurt, respecting her feelings is important in a relationship. The fact that she felt offended and the user didn't acknowledge her perspective properly probably made things worse.\n\nThe user's response of \"I don't care\" when she explains her hurt feelings shows a lack of empathy. Even if they don't see the issue the same way, validating her emotions is key. Relationships require compromising and understanding, especially when it comes to communication styles. The user's insistence that it's not a big deal and that she should get over it suggests they're not prioritizing her feelings, which can damage trust and mutual respect.\n\nAlso, the user brings up that they don't think they should apologize because they don't think they were wrong. But in relationships, sometimes it's about how the other person feels, not just the facts. Even if the statement wasn't intended to be hurtful, the impact matters. The user's refusal to apologize and their dismissive attitude are likely to escalate the conflict instead of resolving it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user might not have meant to be offensive, but their choice of words and subsequent response were hurtful. They are in the wrong for not acknowledging her feelings and responding dismissively. The right approach would be to apologize and be more mindful of their language in the future.\n"
