The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is questioning whether they did something wrong by using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt and offended, saying that the word made her feel dumb. The user, however, feels that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that the girlfriend overreacted. They don't think they need to apologize because they don't see the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is a psych major, so she might have a deeper understanding of the experiment. However, even if the conclusion was obvious to the user, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. The key here is intent versus impact. The user claims they didn't mean to be snarky, but the girlfriend still felt hurt. In relationships, it's important to acknowledge the other person's feelings, even if you don't fully agree with their perspective.\n\nNext, the user's response to the girlfriend's feelings. When the girlfriend expressed her hurt, the user didn't just apologize but instead tried to explain why the girlfriend was wrong to feel that way. This invalidates her feelings, which can be hurtful in itself. The user's statement \"I don't care\" when the girlfriend mentioned others might be offended shows a lack of empathy. Even if the user doesn't see the problem, dismissing the girlfriend's emotions is problematic.\n\nAlso, the user's follow-up about needing the girlfriend to \"not get offended about such little things\" suggests they're prioritizing their own perspective over her emotional experience. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The user's refusal to apologize despite the girlfriend's clear hurt feelings indicates a lack of consideration for her emotional needs.\n\nIn terms of communication, using \"obviously\" can be a trigger for many people. It often implies that the other person is wrong or lacking in understanding, which isn't constructive. Even if the user's intention was neutral, the impact was harmful. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt belittled, and the user's response to that reaction exacerbated the situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is in the wrong because they dismissed their girlfriend's feelings and failed to acknowledge the hurt they caused. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was communicated and the subsequent response were damaging to the relationship. The right approach would have been to apologize, validate her feelings, and avoid making assumptions about her knowledge or experience with the topic.\n"
