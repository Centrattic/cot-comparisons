The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is wondering if they're in the wrong for a situation where they said something was obvious during a conversation with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt offended because she didn't know it was obvious when she first learned about it. The user argues that the conclusion was well-known and obvious, so they didn't mean to offend. The girlfriend, on the other hand, felt it made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of communication in relationships. People often have different sensitivities, and what might seem innocuous to one person can hurt another. The key here is the word \"obviously.\" Even if the user didn't intend it to be dismissive, the word itself can come off as condescending. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her experience was minimized.\n\nThe user mentions that they continued the discussion and later tried to explain why they thought it was obvious. However, when the girlfriend expressed her hurt feelings, the user responded with \"I don't care,\" which is a problem. Even if the user didn't mean to hurt her, the response invalidates her feelings, which can escalate the situation. \n\nIn relationships, acknowledging and respecting each other's emotions is crucial. The user's stance that they don't think an apology is necessary might be seen as dismissive. The girlfriend felt that the user wasn't validating her feelings, which could lead to more issues if not addressed properly.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend is a psychology major, she might be more attuned to how communication affects others. The user's assumption that she should have known it was obvious overlooks her personal experience with the information. Everyone learns and understands things at different times, and expressing surprise or confidence in an outcome can inadvertently make others feel inadequate.\n\nThe user's response of telling the girlfriend to \"get over it\" and not caring about her feelings, even if they do care, shows a lack of empathy in the moment. Apologies and understanding are important for maintaining trust and respect in a relationship. The user's refusal to apologize might be seen as not taking her feelings seriously, which could be why the girlfriend is upset.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the user might not have intended to be offensive, the impact of their words was hurtful. The way they responded to her feelings\u2014invalidating them and refusing to apologize\u2014likely made things worse. Therefore, the user might be at fault for not considering her perspective and for not showing sufficient empathy and remorse.\n"
