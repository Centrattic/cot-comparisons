The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend feeling hurt when the author called an experiment's conclusion \"obvious.\" The author is defending his use of the word, thinking it was safe since the concept is well-known, and he's a psych major. But the girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb because when she first learned it, it wasn't obvious to her.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about the use of the word \"obviously\" and the author's response to her feelings. The author admits he didn't say it snarkily but still used the word. The girlfriend felt offended and hurt. The author then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later says she should get over it. \n\nFirst, the use of \"obviously\" can be a trigger for people. Even if the author meant it neutrally, the word itself can come off as condescending. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt it was a personal attack on her intelligence. The author's dismissal of her feelings is a problem. Even if he didn't mean to, the effect is still there. \n\nWhen someone says their feelings were hurt, the appropriate response is to acknowledge and apologize, not to argue about whether the feelings are justified. The author's response that \"many people wouldn't be offended\" and that he doesn't think she should be shows a lack of empathy. He's invalidating her experience, which is a common aspect of being in the wrong in such situations. \n\nThe author's insistence that the concept was obvious and that as a psych major she should have known it might also come off as dismissive of her learning process. Everyone learns at different paces, and something being obvious to one person isn't necessarily the case for another. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't have malicious intent, his words caused harm, and his response to her feelings was not supportive. The question is whether he's in the wrong. In such cases, the person who causes hurt feelings is typically expected to apologize, even if they didn't mean it. The author's refusal to apologize and his minimizing of her feelings suggest he's in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n"
