The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author saying an experiment's conclusion was obvious, which upset his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key point is the use of the word \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt it was offensive and made her feel dumb. The author argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known it. But the author's main issue is that the girlfriend took offense where he didn't see it.\n\nNow, I need to consider communication in relationships. Even if the author didn't mean to be dismissive, the word \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. People often feel belittled when someone says something is obvious, especially if they're the ones explaining it. The girlfriend mentioned she found it cool when she first learned it, so maybe she was excited to share and the author's response didn't acknowledge her feelings.\n\nThe author also says \"I don't care\" when she explains her hurt feelings. That's a red flag. Dismissing someone's emotions, even if you don't agree with their reaction, can be hurtful. The girlfriend wants an apology, but the author refuses because he doesn't think he's wrong. That refusal to apologize might indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nAnother angle: the author assumes that because the girlfriend is a psych major, she should know the concept. But even experts might not find everything obvious. The author's assumption could be a mistake. The fact that she felt it wasn't obvious at first shows that her perspective is valid.\n\nThe author also says he doesn't think it's a big deal and that he wouldn't be offended if she said that to him. That's a classic example of the \"if I did it to you\" argument, which is flawed because people react differently. The girlfriend's reaction is about how she felt, not about fairness in hypotheticals.\n\nIn relationships, validation is important. The author didn't validate her feelings and instead tried to argue that her reaction was unjustified. That's likely to escalate the conflict. The fact that she felt hurt and he dismisses it shows a communication breakdown. The author's stance that she should just get over it is problematic because it invalidates her emotions.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong. Using \"obviously\" was dismissive, and his response to her feelings was insensitive. Even if he didn't mean to be, the impact matters in these situations. The right move would be to apologize and acknowledge her feelings, even if he doesn't fully agree with her perspective. His refusal to apologize and insistence that she's being too sensitive are key points against him.\n"
