The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with their girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is a psych major, and she learned about an experiment. The user found the conclusion obvious and said so. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't see it that way when she first learned it. The user argues that since it's a well-known concept, it was safe to assume the girlfriend knew it was obvious. But she felt the word \"obviously\" was offensive, making her feel dumb.\n\nHmm, the user mentions they didn't say it in a snarky way. But the problem isn't the tone, it's the word \"obviously\" itself. People often use words like that without considering how others might feel. Even if the user thinks it's obvious, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. She took the time to learn about the experiment and found it interesting when she first encountered it. So when someone else says it's obvious, it can come across as dismissive of her experience.\n\nThe user also says they don't care about the fact that the word is offensive. That's a red flag. In a relationship, acknowledging each other's feelings is important. Even if the user doesn't see it as a big deal, the girlfriend does. The user's response of \"I don't care\" invalidates her feelings, which the girlfriend took as not caring about her. That's a key point. Even if the user apologizes for hurting her, they're dismissing the reason why she's hurt.\n\nAlso, the user suggests that the girlfriend should just get over it. That's not a good approach. In healthy relationships, both partners should validate each other's emotions. If someone is hurt by something you said, even if you think it's trivial, the right response is to acknowledge their feelings and apologize, not minimize them.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the user used a word that, regardless of intent, made their girlfriend feel dumb. Even if the user thinks it's obvious, the impact on the girlfriend matters. The user's response of not caring about her feelings and not apologizing shows a lack of empathy, which is a problem. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
