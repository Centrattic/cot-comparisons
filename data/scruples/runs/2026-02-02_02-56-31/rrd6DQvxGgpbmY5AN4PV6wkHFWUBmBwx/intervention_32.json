The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously.\" The situation is that they were discussing a psychology experiment, and the user found the conclusion obvious. The girlfriend felt offended because the word made her feel dumb, even though she's a psych major.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's intention wasn't to be snarky, but they still used \"obviously.\" Even if it wasn't intended to be harsh, the word itself can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend explained that she didn't find it obvious at first, so the user's statement might have minimized her experience. \n\nThe user is arguing that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known. However, everyone's perspective is different. What's obvious to one person isn't to another, even in the same field. The user's assumption that she should have known it was obvious might be where the issue lies. \n\nThe girlfriend is hurt because she felt her feelings were invalidated. The user's response of \"I don't care\" when she explained her hurt feelings is problematic. Even if the user didn't mean to be offensive, not acknowledging her feelings and dismissing her perspective as overreacting shows a lack of empathy. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the user didn't have malicious intent, the impact on the girlfriend is still real. Apologizing isn't about admitting guilt but showing respect for her feelings. The user's refusal to apologize and their stance that it's a small thing could be seen as not valuing her emotional well-being. \n\nSo, while the user might not have intended to hurt her, the use of \"obviously\" in that context and the subsequent dismissive attitude likely contributed to the hurt. The right approach would be to acknowledge her feelings even if they don't fully agree. Therefore, the user is in the wrong here.\n"
