The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt offended and hurt, while the user thinks it was obvious and doesn't see the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she was proud of learning the concept. The user used \"obviously,\" which can come off as dismissive. Even if the conclusion was obvious to the user, they might not realize that the girlfriend found it cool or wasn't obvious to her at first. The key here is communication styles. Using \"obviously\" often implies that the other person should know the answer, which can be insulting. \n\nThe user argues that the conclusion was well-known and thus obvious, but they might not have considered the emotional impact. The girlfriend's reaction is valid if she felt belittled. Even if the user didn't mean to be snarky, the word choice can still hurt. The user also mentions not caring when the girlfriend tried to explain her feelings, which could indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to acknowledge the other person's feelings, even if you don't fully agree. The user's stance of not apologizing might be seen as not validating their partner's emotions, which can lead to more issues. So, even if the user didn't intend to offend, using \"obviously\" was a poor choice, and they should apologize to maintain a healthy relationship. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
