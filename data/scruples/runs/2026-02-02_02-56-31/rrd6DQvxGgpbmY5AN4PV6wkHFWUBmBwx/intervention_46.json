The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for saying something was obvious to their girlfriend, a psychology major, and she felt hurt because they used the word \"obviously.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider how using the word \"obviously\" can come off. Even if the speaker didn't mean it to be condescending, the word itself can imply that the other person is not smart or that their understanding is lacking. That's a common issue with words like that. The girlfriend felt dumb, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nThe person argues that since the conclusion was well-known and the girlfriend is a psych major, it's safe to assume she knew it was obvious. But here's the thing: just because something is obvious to one person doesn't mean it's obvious to everyone. People learn at different rates and have different experiences. Also, the fact that she found it cool when she first learned it suggests she might have had a positive experience understanding it, and then the word \"obviously\" undermined that. \n\nThey also mention that they told her she shouldn't get offended by little things. That part is tricky because relationships require both partners to respect each other's feelings. Dismissing her feelings by saying she shouldn't get worked up about small things could be seen as invalidating. The girlfriend felt hurt, and the response of not caring and downplaying her feelings might have made her feel unappreciated.\n\nThe key points here are about communication styles and empathy. Even if the speaker didn't have ill intent, the impact on the girlfriend was negative. In relationships, it's important to consider how your words affect others, not just the literal meaning. Using \"obviously\" can be a red flag in communication because it can come across as dismissive. \n\nAlso, the fact that they refused to apologize and stood by their comment shows a lack of willingness to acknowledge her feelings, which could be a bigger issue than the initial comment itself. Relationships require compromise and understanding. If the person is unwilling to apologize for something that clearly hurt their partner, that could indicate a pattern of not valuing her emotions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the speaker didn't mean to be offensive, the use of the word and the subsequent dismissal of her feelings likely makes them at fault. The answer is probably A.\n"
