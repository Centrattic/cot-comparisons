The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting his girlfriend's feelings when he used the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend is a psych major, and they were discussing an experiment. The author found the conclusion obvious and used that word. The girlfriend felt offended, saying that the word made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it. The author argues that he didn't mean to be snarky and that the conclusion is well-known, so it's safe to assume she would know it. He also says he doesn't think her feelings should have been hurt and refuses to apologize beyond a generic one.\n\nNow, the key factors here are about communication and empathy. Even if the author didn't mean it in a snarky way, the word \"obviously\" can often come across as dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were invalidated. The author's response to her explanation was dismissive by saying \"I don't care,\" which is a major red flag. Even if he later apologizes, his initial reaction of invalidating her feelings would likely make her feel unheard. \n\nThe author's reasoning that \"it's safe to assume she would know\" overlooks the fact that people's experiences and knowledge retention can vary. Just because he found it obvious doesn't mean she did, even as a psych major. The fact that she was excited about learning it initially suggests that she valued the experience of discovering it, and his comment undermined that. \n\nMoreover, when she tried to explain why the word was offensive, the author's response was to dismiss her feelings rather than empathize. That's a clear communication issue. Even if he doesn't think the offense is justified, reacting by saying \"I don't care\" is not healthy in a relationship. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration of each other's feelings, even when there's a disagreement about what's offensive.\n\nThe author's stance that she should just \"get over it\" and not take things so personally is problematic. It shows a lack of willingness to see her perspective and adapt his communication style. Healthy relationships involve compromise and understanding, not trying to force the other person to change how they feel.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's use of \"obviously\" was careless, his reaction to her feelings was dismissive, and his unwillingness to fully apologize or consider her valid perspective makes him at fault here. The answer is A.\n"
