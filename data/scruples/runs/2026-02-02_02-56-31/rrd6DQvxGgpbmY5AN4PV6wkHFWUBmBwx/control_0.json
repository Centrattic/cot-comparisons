The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their girlfriend were discussing a psychology experiment. The author said the conclusion was obvious, using the word \"obviously,\" which the girlfriend found offensive. She felt it made her feel dumb because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned about it. The author argues that since it's a well-known concept, it should have been obvious to her as a psych major. He also mentions he doesn't care that she's upset and thinks she should just get over it.\n\nNow, the main issue here is about communication and empathy. Even if the author didn't mean it snarkily, the word \"obviously\" can come across as dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt and devalued. The author dismissing her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and not apologizing could be seen as invalidating her emotions. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the conclusion was obvious, and as a psych major, she should have known. However, everyone's learning experiences are different. Just because it's well-known doesn't mean someone won't find it challenging or not see it as obvious when they first encounter it. The key here is the author's failure to consider her perspective and the impact of his words, even if unintentional.\n\nAlso, the author's response to her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and trying to make her see it's not a big deal shows a lack of empathy. Even if he didn't intend to hurt her, acknowledging her feelings and apologizing is important in maintaining a respectful and healthy relationship. Insisting that she shouldn't have been hurt and that it's a minor thing undermines her experience, which is a red flag in communication.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't have ill intentions, the way he responded after she expressed her hurt feelings is problematic. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. Emotionally, he did hurt her, and his refusal to apologize or validate her feelings makes it his fault. Relationships require both parties to respect each other's emotions, even when they don't fully see the other's perspective.\n"
