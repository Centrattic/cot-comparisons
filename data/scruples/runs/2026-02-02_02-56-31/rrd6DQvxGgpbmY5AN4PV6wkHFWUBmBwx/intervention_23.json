The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend mentioned a psychology experiment she learned in class. The guy responded by saying the conclusion was obvious. She took offense because he used the word \"obviously,\" making her feel dumb. He thinks he's not wrong because he assumed it was obvious to her, being a psych major. She feels hurt and wants an apology, but he's not willing to give one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Using \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended that way. Even if the conclusion is well-known, the fact that she learned it in a class and found it cool suggests she might have found it insightful at the time. Telling her it's obvious might undermine her experience of learning it. \n\nHe mentions he didn't say it in a snarky way, but the word itself can be problematic. People have different experiences and levels of understanding, so what's obvious to one person might not be to another. Even if she's a psych major, she might not have encountered that specific experiment before. The key point here is her reaction and how she felt. She felt stupid, which is significant.\n\nHe argues that he doesn't care that other people might be offended. But in a relationship, it's important to be considerate of each other's feelings. Dismissing her feelings as being too sensitive might not be the right approach. Even if he apologizes, the fact that he's not willing to acknowledge that his words could be hurtful shows a lack of empathy. \n\nAlso, when she tried to explain why \"obviously\" was offensive, he responded with \"I don't care,\" which is dismissive. That would likely make her feel unheard and validated her hurt. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding, so invalidating her feelings is definitely a problem here. \n\nThe guy might not see it as a big deal, but in the context of a relationship, how each person feels matters. The fact that she's a psych student doesn't necessarily mean she should know all the conclusions of every experiment. Each person's learning experience is unique. The use of \"obviously\" in this case, regardless of intent, caused emotional harm, which is something he should take responsibility for. \n\nIn the end, even if he doesn't think he was wrong, his response to her feelings (not caring and invalidating them) is definitely a mistake. So, the answer might be that he is in the wrong.\n"
