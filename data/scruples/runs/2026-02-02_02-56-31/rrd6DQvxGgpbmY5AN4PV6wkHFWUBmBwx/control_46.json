The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author said something was \"obviously\" true during a conversation with his girlfriend, who is a psychology major. She felt hurt because he used the word \"obviously,\" making her feel dumb. The author doesn't think he's wrong and refuses to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the use of the word \"obviously\" and the emotional response. The author's intention wasn't snarky, but the word itself can be dismissive. Even if the conclusion is indeed obvious, using \"obviously\" can imply that the other person should have known it, which can be hurtful, especially in a relationship where both partners want to feel respected and valued.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she found the concept cool when she first learned it and didn't realize it was obvious. The author's response made her feel that her feelings and experience were invalidated. He then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and insists she should get over it. That's a problem because acknowledging someone's feelings is crucial in relationships. By not validating her emotions and instead trying to justify his actions, he's contributing to the conflict.\n\nThe author's stance is that since the conclusion is obvious, it's safe to assume she knew it. However, just because something is common knowledge in a field doesn't mean the person is aware of its obviousness. The author's failure to consider her perspective and his dismissive attitude (\"I don't care\") likely escalated the situation. Relationships require empathy and the willingness to apologize and understand each other's sensitivities. By refusing to apologize and downplaying her feelings, the author is not taking responsibility, which is a red flag.\n\nIn summary, even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact of his words mattered. The use of \"obviously\" was offensive in this context, and his response worsened the situation. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he should have been more considerate of her feelings and apologized.\n"
