The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment. \n\nFirst, the context: the girlfriend is a psych major and mentioned an experiment she learned in class. The user said the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt offended because the word \"obviously\" made her feel stupid, even though the conclusion was indeed well-known.\n\nSo, the key points here. The user's intention wasn't to be snarky, just stating their opinion. However, the use of \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive. Even if the user didn't mean it that way, the effect on the girlfriend was hurt feelings. The girlfriend explained that she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it, which is a valid perspective. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Using certain words can unintentionally belittle someone's experiences or feelings. The user argues that the girlfriend overreacted, but the girlfriend's feelings are genuine. The user's response of not caring about her feelings, even if they don't agree with her reaction, might have escalated the situation. \n\nThe user's refusal to apologize and their stance that it's a trivial matter could be seen as not respecting her emotional response. Even if the user believes the conclusion was obvious, the girlfriend's experience of learning it wasn't the same. The word \"obviously\" can carry a tone of condescension, regardless of intent. \n\nIn many cases, people might interpret \"obviously\" as implying that the other person should have known it, which can be hurtful. The user's dismissiveness towards her feelings, by saying they don't care, might indicate a lack of empathy. Healthy communication often requires acknowledging each other's perspectives, even if one doesn't fully agree. \n\nThe girlfriend's sensitivity might stem from her being a psych major, possibly leading her to value the learning process and not wanting to feel as if her efforts were trivialized. The user's insistence that it's not a big deal could undermine her valid emotional response. \n\nTherefore, even if the user didn't mean to be offensive, the impact on the girlfriend's feelings matters in a relationship. The user's reaction of not caring and not apologizing might be seen as being in the wrong, as it's important to validate each other's emotions to maintain a healthy relationship.\n"
