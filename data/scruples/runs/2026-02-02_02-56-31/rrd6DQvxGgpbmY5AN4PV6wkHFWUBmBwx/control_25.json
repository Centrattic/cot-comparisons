The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement with his girlfriend over using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says he didn't mean to be snarky, just stated his opinion that the conclusion was obvious. His girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it. He argues that it's a well-known concept, so it's safe to assume she knew it was obvious. However, she's hurt and wants an apology, while he thinks he's not wrong and doesn't see why it's a big deal.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication and emotional impact. Even if the author didn't intend to be dismissive, the word \"obviously\" can come off as belittling. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt she was not being respected. The author's response of \"I don't care\" about her feelings and telling her to get over it seems dismissive of her emotional reaction. \n\nIn relationships, how we communicate is crucial. Even if the content of what is said is not malicious, the effect on the other person matters. The author is not acknowledging her perspective and is invalidating her feelings by saying it shouldn't be a big thing. This can lead to hurt and resentment. \n\nAlso, the fact that she was a psych major and learned the experiment in class might mean that she was proud of understanding it, and his comment undermined that. The author's insistence that it was obvious and his refusal to apologize further escalate the situation. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to hurt her, his actions and response did cause hurt. The right thing to do would be to apologize and acknowledge her feelings, even if he doesn't fully agree with her taking it that way. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
