The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing a psychology experiment. The girlfriend is a psych major and shared an experiment's conclusion. The author said it was obvious, which hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The key issue here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the conclusion was indeed obvious to the author, the way it was said might not have been considered. The girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned it. \n\nI remember that communication styles can vary. What one person finds obvious might not be to another, even in the same field. The author assumed that as a psych major, she should know it was obvious. But maybe she was still learning and didn't grasp it immediately. The word \"obviously\" can come off as condescending, implying that the other person should have known it.\n\nThe author also dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" when she explained why it hurt her. Even if he didn't mean to, his response invalidated her emotions. It's important to acknowledge someone's feelings, even if you don't fully understand why they feel that way. \n\nHe later told her to not get offended by little things. That might come across as dismissive, expecting her to just move on without addressing her feelings. Healthy communication involves validating each other's emotions, not brushing them aside. \n\nSo, while the author might not have had malicious intent, his actions did hurt her feelings. The fact that he's unwilling to apologize and insists her feelings shouldn't be hurt suggests he's not taking her perspective into account. In relationships, it's about empathy and understanding, not just right or wrong. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he failed to consider how his words affected her and didn't validate her feelings properly.\n"
