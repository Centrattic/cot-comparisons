The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with their girlfriend. The user is asking if they're at fault for hurting her feelings by doing so.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is a psych major and learned about an experiment. She found the conclusion cool when she first learned it, but the author said it was obvious. The girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb because it wasn't obvious to her initially. The author argues that since it's a well-known concept, it was safe to assume she knew it, and they don't think the word was offensive in this context. They even say they don't care about her feelings in this case and think she's overreacting.\n\nHmm. The key here is about the perception and intention. The author's intention wasn't to be snarky, but using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. Even if the conclusion is common knowledge, the way it's presented matters. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt and undervalued. The author isn't taking responsibility for the impact of their words, even after being told it made her feel stupid. They're also dismissing her feelings by saying it's a small thing and that she should just get over it. That's not empathetic. It's about respecting her feelings, not just the factual validity of their statement. Relationships require considering how others feel, so the author is in the wrong for not acknowledging her emotions and for not apologizing. The answer should be A.\n"
