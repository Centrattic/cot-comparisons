The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend. The key points here are about communication and emotional impact.\n\nFirst, the author says he used \"obviously\" in a neutral way, not snarky. But his girlfriend felt it was offensive because it made her feel dumb. She's a psych major, and the concept in question was a well-known one. The author thought it was obvious she would know it, but she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned it.\n\nNow, the main issue here is about how the word \"obviously\" is perceived. Even if the speaker doesn't mean to be condescending, the term can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. The author, on the other hand, is struggling to see why she's upset and is resisting apologizing. He thinks she's overreacting.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider the other person's feelings, even if you don't see the issue the same way. The fact that the author dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and then told her to not get offended about little things shows a lack of empathy. Validating someone's emotions is crucial, even if you don't agree with their interpretation. By not acknowledging her feelings and instead trying to justify his use of the word, the author is likely at fault here. The situation could have been resolved with a simple apology and reassurance, but his refusal to apologize and his dismissive attitude make him the one in the wrong.\n"
