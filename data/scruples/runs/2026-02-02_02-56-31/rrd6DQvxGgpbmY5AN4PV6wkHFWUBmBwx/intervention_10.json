The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for saying something was \"obvious\" to their girlfriend, which hurt her feelings. The situation seems pretty straightforward, but there are a few points to consider.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is a psych major and learned about the experiment in class. The user thought the conclusion was obvious and said so. The girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb because she didn't think it was obvious when she first learned it. The user argues that it's a well-known concept, so it should have been obvious to her as a psych major. \n\nNow, I need to assess both sides. The user's intention wasn't to be snarky, but the word \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive. Even if the user didn't mean it that way, the effect was that it hurt her feelings. The girlfriend felt that her experience of not finding it obvious was invalidated. \n\nThe user's response to her explanation was to say \"I don't care,\" which seems dismissive of her feelings. Even if they think they're right, not acknowledging her emotions could be seen as not caring about her perspective. The user also insists they don't think the feelings should have been hurt, which might show a lack of empathy. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Using language that can be perceived as belittling, even if unintended, can create hurt. The fact that the user minimized the issue and didn't apologize immediately might have made her feel undervalued. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were dismissed. The user's stance that it's a \"little thing\" might not consider the emotional impact. \n\nSo, while the user might not have had malicious intent, their words and subsequent dismissal could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not being more empathetic and for not taking responsibility for the hurt caused.\n"
