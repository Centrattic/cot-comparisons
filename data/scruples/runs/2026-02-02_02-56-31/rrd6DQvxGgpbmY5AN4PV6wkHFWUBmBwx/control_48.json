The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple discussing a psychology experiment. The author said the conclusion of the experiment was obvious, using the word \"obviously,\" which hurt his girlfriend's feelings. She felt it made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious when she learned it first. The author is asking if he's the asshole here (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author used \"obviously,\" which is a common word that can come off as dismissive or condescending. The girlfriend is a psych major, so the author assumed she should know this. However, she was learning it in her class and didn't find it obvious at the time. The author's response implied that she should have known, which made her feel stupid. \n\nThe author argues that it was safe to assume she would know since she's a psych major, and the conclusion is well-known. He also mentions that he didn't mean it snarkily, just stating the obvious. However, the girlfriend's feelings were hurt because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned about it. The author is reluctant to apologize, thinking she's overreacting and that he didn't mean to be offensive.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the author didn't intend to be rude, the impact on his girlfriend matters. The word \"obviously\" can be perceived as minimizing someone's experience or knowledge. The fact that she was initially learning it and didn't find it obvious at the time suggests that the author's response invalidated her experience. \n\nThe author's response of \"I don't care\" when she explained why it was offensive is problematic. It shows a lack of willingness to understand her perspective. The author does apologize for hurting her feelings but doesn't acknowledge that his words were the issue. Instead, he downplays the situation, which can cause further hurt. \n\nIn such cases, the person who feels hurt is in their right to expect empathy and validation. The author's insistence that he's not wrong and that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" is dismissive. Even if the conclusion was obvious to him, it's not about personal knowledge but about how his words made her feel. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings and response, and his dismissive attitude towards her concerns is hurtful. Even if he didn't mean to be condescending, the effect of his words was negative, and the appropriate response would be to apologize and adjust his communication to be more supportive.\n"
