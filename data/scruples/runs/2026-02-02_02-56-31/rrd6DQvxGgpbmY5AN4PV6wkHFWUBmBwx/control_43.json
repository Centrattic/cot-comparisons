The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend is a psych major and shared an experiment. The author found the conclusion obvious and said so. The girlfriend felt offended because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author doesn't think it was a big deal and is refusing to apologize, thinking her feelings shouldn't have been hurt.\n\nHmm. The key here is about communication and respect. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. Even if the conclusion was indeed obvious to the author, the girlfriend might have learned it as a student who didn't see it immediately. The author's assumption that it's obvious to her because she's a psych major could be flawed. The fact that she found it cool when she first learned it suggests it wasn't obvious to her at the time. \n\nThe author's response to her feelings is important. He said \"I don't care\" and told her not to get worked up over little things. That shows a lack of empathy. Even if he didn't mean to be snarky, his reaction to her hurt feelings is dismissive. He's not validating her emotions, which can cause further hurt. \n\nIn relationships, how we express our thoughts matters. Words like \"obviously\" can be minimizing, especially in a context where the other person is sharing something they learned. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt disrespected. The author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that it's not a big deal suggests he's not considering her perspective enough. \n\nEven if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was communicated was hurtful. The author should have been more careful with his language to avoid making her feel that her experience or understanding was trivial. The fact that he invalidated her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and telling her to get over it is a major issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he dismissed her feelings and used language that was disrespectful, even if unintentionally. The answer should be A.\n"
