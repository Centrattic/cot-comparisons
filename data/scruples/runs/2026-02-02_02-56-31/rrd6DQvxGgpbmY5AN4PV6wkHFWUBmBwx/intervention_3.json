The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend is a psych major and shared an experiment. The user thought the conclusion was obvious and said so. The girlfriend felt offended, as if the user was belittling her. The user is defending their use of \"obviously,\" arguing that the conclusion is well-known and therefore obvious, and they don't see why the girlfriend would be hurt. They even go as far as saying they don't care if others would be offended and that the girlfriend should get over it. Now, the girlfriend is waiting for an apology, but the user is resisting.\n\nThe key points here are communication styles and emotional sensitivity. The user's use of \"obviously\" might come across as dismissive, even if not intended. In relationships, it's important to acknowledge each other's feelings. The girlfriend's perspective is that the word made her feel stupid because she didn't find it obvious at the time. The user's response of not caring about her feelings and telling her to get over it might be the bigger issue here. Even if the user didn't mean to offend, the impact is still real. Relationships often require empathy and validation, even when the other person's feelings seem trivial. The user's insistence that they're not in the wrong and their dismissiveness could be seen as invalidating, which can harm the relationship. So, while the user might not have intended to hurt her, their reaction and lack of empathy might make them at fault. The answer is probably A.\n"
