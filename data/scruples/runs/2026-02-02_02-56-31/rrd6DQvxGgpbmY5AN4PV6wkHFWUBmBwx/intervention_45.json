The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion with their girlfriend. They mentioned that the experiment's conclusion was obvious to them and they didn't mean it snarkily, just stating their opinion.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't know it was obvious when she first learned about it. She felt the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The user argues that since she's a psych major, she should have known it was obvious. But wait, just because someone is in a certain field doesn't mean they know every detail or that everything is obvious to them. People can have different perspectives and learning experiences.\n\nThe user also said they don't care that the word \"obviously\" can be offensive, even though they acknowledge it's generally considered rude. They feel their girlfriend overreacted and that she should just get over it. That's a problem because dismissing someone's feelings as an overreaction isn't healthy. Even if the user didn't mean to offend, the impact on the girlfriend is real. She felt hurt, and the user's refusal to apologize or validate her feelings further escalates the conflict.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. While the user's intent wasn't malicious, the impact was hurtful. Relationships require empathy and understanding. Dismissing someone's feelings because you don't see it as a big deal can damage trust and communication. The user's response of \"I don't care\" when the girlfriend explained her feelings shows a lack of empathy. It's important to apologize and acknowledge the hurt, even if you didn't mean to cause it. The user's attitude that the girlfriend shouldn't get offended over such things is problematic because it invalidates her experience. Everyone has different sensitivities, and respecting those is crucial in a relationship.\n\nSo, even if the user didn't mean to be offensive, their words hurt their partner, and their response to her feelings was dismissive. That makes them at fault here.\n"
