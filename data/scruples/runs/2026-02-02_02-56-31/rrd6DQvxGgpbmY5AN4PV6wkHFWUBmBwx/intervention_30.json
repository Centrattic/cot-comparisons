The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for making their girlfriend feel dumb by using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't realize the conclusion was obvious when she learned it, and the user's comment made her feel stupid. The user defends their use of the word, saying it was clear and that as a psych major, the girlfriend should have known it. They also mention that they don't think apologizing is necessary since they don't think the issue is big.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social dynamics here. Using words like \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending, especially in a relationship where one person is trying to share something they found interesting. Even if the user didn't mean it that way, the impact on the girlfriend is what matters. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt and belittled. The user's response of \"I don't care\" about her feelings and wanting her to \"get over it\" probably made things worse. \n\nThe key points here are about empathy and communication. The user might not see the issue, but in relationships, it's important to acknowledge the other person's feelings even if you don't fully agree with their perspective. The user's refusal to apologize and dismissing her feelings as overreacting could be seen as invalidating and hurtful. \n\nAlso, the experiment's conclusion being obvious doesn't negate the other person's experience of learning it for the first time. Everyone has different experiences and learning curves. Even if it's a well-known concept now, it wasn't obvious to her at the time. The user's comment might have been unintentionally rude.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to show understanding and support. The user's insistence that they aren't wrong and that the girlfriend should stop getting offended might indicate a lack of emotional intelligence. They need to recognize that their words had a negative effect and take responsibility, even if they don't see it as wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the user didn't intend to be offensive, their actions hurt their partner's feelings. The response to her hurt feelings by dismissing them as trivial is a problem. Therefore, the user is likely in the wrong.\n"
