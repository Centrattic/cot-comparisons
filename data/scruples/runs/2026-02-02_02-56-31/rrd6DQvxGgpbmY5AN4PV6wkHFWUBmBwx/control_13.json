The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and their girlfriend over the use of the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author said that the conclusion of the experiment was obvious, using \"obviously\" in a straightforward way, without any snark. They argue that the conclusion is a well-known concept, so it was reasonable to assume the girlfriend would know it. However, the girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't realize it was obvious to her, and she felt the word made her feel dumb. The author is reluctant to apologize, thinking that her reaction is overblown and that the feelings shouldn't have been hurt in the first place.\n\nNow, considering communication dynamics. The word \"obviously\" can come across as dismissive, even if not intended that way. It might imply that the other person should know something, which can be perceived as a criticism of their knowledge or intelligence. Even if the author didn't mean it snarkily, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt that way. People's feelings are subjective, and even if the author doesn't see the issue, the impact of their words matters.\n\nThe author also mentions that the girlfriend \"tried to explain why it was offensive,\" but he responded with \"I don't care,\" which could be seen as invalidating her feelings. By not acknowledging her perspective and insisting that it shouldn't have been a big deal, he might be dismissing her valid emotional response. The author's insistence that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" suggests a lack of empathy towards her feelings, which is a red flag in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings even if you don't fully understand them. The key point here is whether the author's use of \"obviously\" was careless. Even if the conclusion was indeed obvious, using such a word can be hurtful. The author's refusal to apologize and his attitude that the girlfriend is overreacting could damage the relationship's trust and communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the topic was a well-known concept, so it's reasonable to assume the girlfriend would know it. However, psych majors might encounter various experiments, and some might not be immediately obvious to everyone, even within the field. The fact that the girlfriend felt it wasn't obvious at the time suggests that the author's assumption was incorrect.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have intended to be hurtful, the impact of his words did cause the girlfriend emotional distress. The author's response to her feelings by dismissing them as overblown and refusing to apologize shows a lack of consideration for her perspective. In healthy relationships, partners should prioritize each other's feelings and seek to understand rather than dismiss. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his actions, though perhaps unintentional, hurt his girlfriend, and his subsequent response was invalidating and dismissive.\n"
