The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with their girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt and believed the word made her feel dumb. The author defends their use of the word, arguing that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that as a psych major, it should have been obvious to her. They also mention not caring about her feelings on this matter, even though they apologize for hurting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's reaction: she felt disrespected and belittled because the word \"obviously\" was used. Even if the conclusion was obvious to the author, using that word can come across as dismissive. The author's stance is that they didn't intend to offend and that the conclusion was common knowledge. \n\nNext, think about communication in relationships. Using words like \"obviously\" can be seen as condescending, regardless of intent. The key here is that the author didn't consider how their words might affect the girlfriend. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was delivered hurt her feelings. The author's response to her explanation was to say \"I don't care,\" which invalidates her emotions. That's a red flag. \n\nAlso, when the girlfriend tried to explain why \"obviously\" was offensive, the author dismissed her feelings instead of empathizing. Even if the author didn't see the issue, they should have acknowledged her feelings to maintain a healthy relationship. The girlfriend's sensitivity to that word isn't unreasonable because it's a common issue in communication. Many people find \"obviously\" to be a trigger for sounding condescending.\n\nThe author's argument that it's \"safe to assume it was obvious to her\" overlooks the fact that everyone has different experiences and levels of prior knowledge, even within the same field. Just because it's obvious to the author doesn't mean it's obvious to someone else. The author's insistence that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" shows a lack of emotional support and understanding. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings, even if you don't fully understand why they're hurt. The author's refusal to apologize and their dismissive attitude likely caused further strain. The girlfriend's request for an apology is about acknowledging her feelings, not just the word itself. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author's use of \"obviously\" was hurtful, and their reaction to her feelings was dismissive. Even if the intention wasn't there, the impact on the relationship is significant. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
