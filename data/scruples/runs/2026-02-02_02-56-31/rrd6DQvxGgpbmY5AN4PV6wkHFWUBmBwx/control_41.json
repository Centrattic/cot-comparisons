The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when talking to their girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author might think that using \"obviously\" was just stating a fact since the conclusion is well-known. But the girlfriend's reaction is that it made her feel dumb. The key here is understanding how the word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way.\n\nThe author argues that it was safe to assume the conclusion was obvious to her as a psych major. However, people can have different experiences. Just because it's a well-known concept doesn't mean everyone found it obvious when they first encountered it. The girlfriend might have struggled with it or found it interesting as a new learner. Using \"obviously\" might negate her personal experience, making her feel her reaction wasn't valid.\n\nAlso, the author's response after being told it hurt her feelings was to dismiss her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later telling her to not get offended over small things. This shows a lack of empathy and invalidates her emotions. Even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact on the girlfriend is real. Relationships often require acknowledging others' feelings even if you don't fully understand why they're hurt. The author's refusal to apologize and insistence that it's not a big deal could be seen as being in the wrong because they're not taking responsibility for their part in the hurt feelings.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't have a malicious intent, the effect was harmful. In such situations, the intention isn't the only factor; the impact matters. The author should probably apologize and adjust their communication to be more considerate in the future. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
