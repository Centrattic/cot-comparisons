The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (who's a guy in this situation) is in the wrong for hurting his girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the context: His girlfriend is a psych major and shared an experiment. He found the conclusion obvious and said so. She felt offended because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. He argues that the conclusion is well-known and obvious, so it's safe to assume she should have known it. She insists it wasn't obvious to her at the time, and his comment hurt her feelings. He then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care,\" which escalated the situation. He later tells her she shouldn't get worked up over small things.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication and empathy. Using the word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt belittled. The author's response\u2014saying he doesn't care and that she should just get over it\u2014shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. Even if he didn't mean to be condescending, the impact of his words and his reaction to her feelings is what matters here. \n\nThe author is in a position where he's expected to be supportive in their relationship. Dismissing her emotions as trivial is problematic. It's not just about whether the conclusion was obvious but how he communicated it and then responded to her hurt feelings. Relationships require mutual respect and validation. So, even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he expressed it and his subsequent defensiveness likely made him at fault. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
