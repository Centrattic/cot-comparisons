The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple regarding the use of the word \"obviously.\" The author said something was obvious during a conversation with his girlfriend, who is a psych major. She felt offended and hurt because he implied that the conclusion was so obvious she should have known it, making her feel dumb. The author doesn't think he was wrong because the conclusion was indeed obvious and he assumed she, as a psych major, would know it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The key points are communication style, emotional impact, and assumptions. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended. Even if the author didn't mean to be snarky, the choice of words might have unintentionally undermined her feelings. The girlfriend felt that her experience of finding the experiment cool and not obvious at first was invalidated. \n\nThe author's response to her explanation was to say \"I don't care,\" which seems dismissive of her feelings. Even though he later apologizes, his initial reaction and insistence that he wasn't wrong could have worsened the situation. Relationships often require sensitivity to each other's emotions, even when the other person's perspective seems trivial. \n\nAlso, the author's assumption that because she's a psych major, she should have found it obvious, might be an overgeneralization. Just because someone is in a field doesn't mean they know every detail or found everything obvious. The girlfriend's reaction is about her personal experience and how she felt respected in the conversation. \n\nThe author's stance that she shouldn't get offended over \"little things\" might be where he's in the wrong. In healthy relationships, both partners should make an effort to understand each other's feelings, even if they don't see the issue the same way. Dismissing her feelings as unnecessary could lead to further resentment. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to hurt her, using language that can be perceived as condescending, and then not validating her feelings when she explains her hurt, contributes to being in the wrong. The key here is empathy and communication. The answer is likely A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
