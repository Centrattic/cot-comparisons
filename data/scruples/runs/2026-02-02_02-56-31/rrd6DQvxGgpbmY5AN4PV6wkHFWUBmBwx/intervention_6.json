The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend feeling hurt because the user said something was \"obvious\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment. The user is a psychology major and thinks the conclusion was obvious, so he mentioned that. The girlfriend took offense because she felt it made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" It's a common word, but people can take it as condescending. Even if the user didn't mean it that way, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. She's a psych major, so maybe she was proud of learning the concept and didn't expect it to be obvious to her. The user's comment might have undermined her feelings of accomplishment or understanding.\n\nThe user then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" when she explains why she was hurt. That's a problem because it shows a lack of empathy. Even if he didn't intend to hurt her, not acknowledging her feelings can make things worse. The girlfriend wants an apology, but the user is unwilling. He says he's sorry he hurt her but doesn't think she should have been hurt. That's invalidating her feelings, which can be hurtful in itself.\n\nAnother angle is communication styles. People have different sensitivities. The girlfriend might be more sensitive to how her knowledge or intelligence is perceived. The user, thinking it's obvious, might not grasp why she's upset. But in a relationship, it's important to consider the other person's perspective, even if it seems minor to you. The user's insistence that it's not a big deal and telling her to \"get over it\" is not supportive. It's about mutual respect and understanding.\n\nAlso, the user's response to her explanation by saying \"I don't care\" and not apologizing suggests he's not prioritizing her emotional needs. Even if he believes he's right, how he responds affects the relationship dynamics. The girlfriend feeling that her feelings are being invalidated could lead to more issues if not addressed properly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user likely is in the wrong because the use of \"obviously\" was hurtful, and his dismissive response didn't validate her feelings. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he communicated it and his lack of empathy afterward contributed to the problem. The right approach would be to acknowledge her feelings, apologize, and show willingness to listen, rather than dismissing her.\n"
