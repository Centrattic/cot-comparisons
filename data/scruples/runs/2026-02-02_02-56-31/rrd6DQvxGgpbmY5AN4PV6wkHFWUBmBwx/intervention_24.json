The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The girlfriend mentioned an experiment she learned in class. The user responded that the conclusion was obvious. The key here is the use of \"obviously.\" Even if the conclusion is well-known, using that word can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb because she didn't see it as obvious at the time. \n\nThe user argues that since she's a psych major, she should have known it was obvious. But people can have different experiences; even experts might not find everything obvious on first exposure. The user's assumption that she should have known it was obvious might be the issue here. \n\nThen, when the girlfriend expressed her feelings, the user didn't apologize and said \"I don't care,\" which could be seen as invalidating her emotions. The user is now in a position where they're not willing to apologize, thinking she's overreacting. However, relationships often require empathy and acknowledging each other's feelings, even if the other person's perspective seems trivial. \n\nThe user's response of needing her to \"get over it\" might not be the most supportive approach. Validating her feelings, even if you don't fully agree, is crucial in maintaining mutual respect. The fact that she felt hurt shows that the word had a negative impact, regardless of the user's intent. \n\nSo, even if the user didn't mean to be condescending, the effect of using \"obviously\" was hurtful. The right approach would be to apologize for making her feel that way, even if the user doesn't see the issue the same way. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not recognizing the emotional impact and for not apologizing.\n"
