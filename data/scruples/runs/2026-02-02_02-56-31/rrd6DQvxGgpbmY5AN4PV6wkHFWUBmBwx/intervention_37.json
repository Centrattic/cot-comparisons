The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. He thought the conclusion was obvious, but she felt it made her feel dumb because she didn't see it that way when she learned it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe he expected her to know it. But he didn't know her experience with that specific experiment. Assuming something is obvious can be a big assumption. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended. He says it wasn't snarky, but the impact matters more than the intent here.\n\nHe argues that the conclusion is well-known and obvious, so it's safe to assume she knew. But the problem is that she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned it. Her feelings were hurt because he minimized her experience. She felt invalidated when he didn't acknowledge her perspective. He then dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later says he doesn't think her feelings should be hurt. That's a problem because valid feelings shouldn't be dismissed just because they seem trivial to one person.\n\nThe key here is empathy. Even if he doesn't see the issue, his girlfriend did. Dismissing her feelings because he doesn't understand why they're hurt makes the situation worse. Apologies are necessary here because he hurt her, even if he didn't mean to. The fact that she's a psych major might mean she knows the field but not every specific study's obviousness. Also, people can find different things obvious based on their background.\n\nSo, even if the conclusion was obvious to him, he shouldn't have used \"obviously\" without considering her perspective. The argument that it's not a big deal ignores her emotional response. The answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
