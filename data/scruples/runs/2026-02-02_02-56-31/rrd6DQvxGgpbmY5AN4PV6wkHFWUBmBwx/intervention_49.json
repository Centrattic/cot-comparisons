The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't know the conclusion was obvious to her at the time. The user argues that the conclusion really is obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known that. They also mention that using \"obviously\" isn't offensive in this context, and they don't think they need to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the situation. The user used \"obviously\" in a way that implied the conclusion was clear to everyone, including their girlfriend. However, the girlfriend was upset because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about the experiment, and being told it was obvious now made her feel like she was wrong or not smart. \n\nEven though the user didn't intend to be dismissive, the word \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. People often use it to belittle others' lack of understanding or to show off their own knowledge. In a relationship, it's important to be mindful of how words might be received, even if the intention isn't malicious. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt and stupid, which is a real emotional response.\n\nThe user's response to her feelings\u2014saying they don't care and that it's not a big deal\u2014invalidates her emotions. Acknowledging someone's feelings is crucial for maintaining trust and respect. By not apologizing and insisting that she should just move on, the user might be seen as not prioritizing her emotional needs, which can create a rift in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might genuinely not see the issue, thinking that the conclusion was just too obvious. But relationships require empathy and understanding. Even if the user doesn't think they were wrong, the impact on the girlfriend's feelings is a key factor here. The fact that the girlfriend is still upset and the user is unwilling to apologize suggests that there's a breakdown in communication and emotional support.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user might be in the wrong for not recognizing the hurtful impact of their words and for dismissing their girlfriend's feelings. The use of \"obviously\" can be offensive, and the response to the hurt feelings exacerbates the issue. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
