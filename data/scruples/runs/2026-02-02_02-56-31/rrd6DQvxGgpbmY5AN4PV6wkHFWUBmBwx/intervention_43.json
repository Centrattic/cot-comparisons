The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion with their girlfriend. They mention that the experiment's conclusion was obvious to them, so they said something like, \"that's obviously the case.\" The girlfriend felt hurt because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She explained that when she first learned about the experiment, it wasn't obvious to her, so the user's comment made her feel like she didn't understand it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is in a relationship where communication is key. Even if the user didn't mean to be snarky, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. People's feelings can be sensitive, especially when they're sharing something they found interesting or learned about. The girlfriend is a psych major, so she might have put effort into understanding the experiment. The user's comment might have undermined her effort or made her feel like her initial experience wasn't valid.\n\nThe user argues that the conclusion was obviously well-known and that as a psych major, their girlfriend should know that. However, even in a field of study, understanding can come after learning. The fact that it's obvious now doesn't mean it was obvious when she first encountered it. The user's statement might have overlooked her perspective at the time.\n\nThe girlfriend is emphasizing that the word \"obviously\" is offensive in this context. The user is dismissive, saying \"I don't care\" and that it's a small thing. This response invalidates her feelings. In relationships, acknowledging and validating a partner's emotions is important. Even if the user doesn't see the issue, the girlfriend's feelings are real and need to be addressed.\n\nThe user's refusal to apologize and their insistence that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" suggests a lack of empathy. It's possible that the user isn't considering the emotional impact of their words. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, and the user's response exacerbates the situation by not showing understanding.\n\nIn communication, intent versus impact matters. Even if the user didn't mean to hurt her, the impact was negative. The key here is whether the user is willing to listen and adjust their communication to respect their partner's feelings. Relationships require compromise and understanding, and the user's dismissive attitude might be the real issue here.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the user is likely in the wrong because they dismissed their girlfriend's feelings and didn't validate her experience. The answer is A.\n"
