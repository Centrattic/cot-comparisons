The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's girlfriend brought up a psychology experiment, and he said the conclusion was obvious. She felt offended because he used the word \"obviously,\" making her feel dumb. He argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known. He doesn't think he's in the wrong because he didn't mean to be snarky and thinks the issue is overblown.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and perception. The author used \"obviously,\" which can come off as dismissive, even if not intended. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling invalidated. The author, in turn, dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and tries to justify it by saying it was obvious. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider how others perceive things, not just the intention. Even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the word \"obviously\" can be hurtful. The girlfriend felt her feelings were invalidated when he didn't apologize and said she shouldn't get upset over small things. That's a red flag because it's about invalidating her emotions. \n\nThe author's stance that he doesn't care about her feelings here is counterproductive. Apologizing isn't about being wrong, but about respecting her feelings. The fact that he's not willing to apologize and is pushing back shows a lack of empathy. \n\nSo, even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he communicated it was hurtful. The author is in the wrong for dismissing her feelings and not taking her perspective into account.\n"
