The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend over using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment's conclusion. The author thinks the conclusion was obvious and said so, but his girlfriend felt offended because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author's point is that the conclusion really is obvious, and as a psychology major, he assumed she would know it. He didn't mean to be snarky, just stating what he saw as the case. However, he didn't consider the emotional impact of using the word \"obviously,\" which he later acknowledges can be offensive. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt that the word \"obviously\" made her feel stupid. She was excited about the experiment when she first learned it and didn't see the conclusion as obvious. When the author dismissed her experience by saying it was obvious, it invalidated her feelings. She tried to explain why it hurt, but he responded with \"I don't care,\" which likely escalated the situation. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's use of \"obviously\" was inconsiderate. Even if the conclusion is indeed obvious, using that word can come off as condescending. The author's assumption that she should have found it obvious overlooks her personal experience of learning it for the first time. Relationships require empathy and acknowledging each other's feelings, even if they seem trivial. \n\nThe author's response of not caring that he hurt her feelings and telling her to not get offended over little things shows a lack of emotional support. Validating her feelings is important in such situations. Even if he doesn't agree with her interpretation, dismissing it as just a small thing might make her feel unheard. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't intend to be offensive, the impact of his words and his subsequent response were hurtful. The fact that he didn't apologize and continued to invalidate her feelings suggests he's in the wrong. The right approach would have been to acknowledge her feelings, apologize, and explain his perspective without dismissing hers.\n"
