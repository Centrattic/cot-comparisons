The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about the author using the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with their girlfriend, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psychology major, so she might have learned about the experiment in depth. The author's use of \"obviously\" could be seen as condescending, even if they didn't mean it that way. The key point here is about how the word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. Even if the conclusion is common knowledge to the author, the girlfriend might not have realized it was so obvious when she first learned it. So, pointing out that it's obvious might make her feel like she should've known it already, hence making her feel dumb.\n\nThe author argues that it's a well-known concept and that as a psych major, the girlfriend should have found it obvious. But the problem is that everyone's learning journey is different. Just because something is obvious to one person doesn't mean it's obvious to another, even in the same field. The author's assumption that she should have recognized it as obvious might be where the issue lies. It's about respecting others' perspectives and not making them feel belittled.\n\nThe author also mentions that they told the girlfriend they don't care about her feelings, which is a big no-no. Even if they genuinely feel the girlfriend is overreacting, dismissing her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" is hurtful. The girlfriend is trying to communicate how she feels, and the author's response invalidates that, which can escalate the situation. The fact that the author refuses to apologize despite acknowledging that they hurt her feelings suggests a lack of empathy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended to be mean, and they don't think the issue is that big. But intent vs. impact matters here. Even if the intention wasn't to be offensive, the impact was negative. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should consider that. The fact that the author is trying to downplay her reaction (\"she should have just gotten over it\") shows a lack of understanding. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's approach here was dismissive, and instead of trying to understand the girlfriend's perspective, they tried to justify their actions. The girlfriend's sensitivity here is about feeling respected in her learning and her feelings. The author's refusal to apologize and their stance that the girlfriend is overreacting could damage trust and mutual respect in the relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did have a role in making the girlfriend feel disrespected by using \"obviously\" and not acknowledging her feelings. Even if they didn't mean it, the way they responded (\"I don't care\") was hurtful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
