The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when talking to their girlfriend. The situation is that they were discussing a psychology experiment, and he found the conclusion obvious. She felt hurt because the word made her feel dumb. He's defending himself by saying that the conclusion really is obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known it. But she didn't, and she was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The word \"obviously\" can be a bit of a trigger for people because it can sound dismissive. Even if the user didn't mean it that way, the effect is there. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. The problem is that the user is dismissing her feelings by saying he doesn't think it's a big deal. He's also telling her to not get offended by small things, which might not be helpful. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to acknowledge each other's feelings, even if you don't see the issue the same way. The user's response of \"I don't care\" when she explained why the word was offensive probably made things worse. Even if he apologizes later, his initial reaction of not caring about her feelings is problematic. \n\nAlso, the fact that she found the concept cool when she first learned it suggests that it wasn't obvious to her at the time. His assumption that she should have known it was obvious is a bit presumptuous. Maybe she learned the experiment in a context where the conclusion wasn't immediately clear to her, or she just didn't realize how obvious it was. \n\nHe's arguing that it's safe to assume she knew, but that's not really the point. The issue is about how she felt. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he expressed his opinion made her feel bad. The word \"obviously\" can carry a connotation of looking down on the other person's understanding. \n\nSo, the user's refusal to apologize and his insistence that her feelings shouldn't matter might be the bigger issue here. Even if he didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact is still real. In relationships, validation of each other's emotions is crucial. By saying \"I don't care\" about her feelings, he's undermining her experience. \n\nTherefore, the user is likely in the wrong because he didn't consider how his words affected her and dismissed her feelings instead of acknowledging them. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
