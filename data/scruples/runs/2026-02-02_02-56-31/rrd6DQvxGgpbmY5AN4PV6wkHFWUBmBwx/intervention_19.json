The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with their girlfriend. She felt it made her feel dumb. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's girlfriend is a psych major, so the experiment's conclusion being obvious might be a given. But the user didn't say it in a snarky way. They just stated their opinion. However, the girlfriend felt hurt because the word \"obviously\" implied she should have known it, which she didn't when she first learned it.\n\nThe user argues that the conclusion is well-known and obvious, so using \"obviously\" wasn't wrong. They also mention they don't care about her feelings in this case and that she's overreacting. The girlfriend felt invalidated when the user dismissed her feelings, leading to the conflict.\n\nNow, thinking about communication in relationships. Even if the user didn't mean to be offensive, the word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. People's feelings are valid even if the reasoning seems trivial to others. The user's response of \"I don't care\" might have escalated the situation. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to acknowledge each other's feelings, even if you don't fully agree. The user's insistence that it's not a big deal and that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" shows a lack of empathy. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was communicated could have been more considerate.\n\nSo, while the user might not have intended harm, the effect was hurtful. The key here is that intent isn't the only factor\u2014impact matters too. The user's response to the girlfriend's feelings (by dismissing them) is where they're most in the wrong. They should have apologized to maintain relationship harmony, regardless of their perspective on the issue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the user is in the wrong) because using \"obviously\" in that context hurt the girlfriend's feelings, and their dismissive response worsened the situation.\n"
