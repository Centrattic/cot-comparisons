The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe situation is about a girlfriend and boyfriend discussing a psychology experiment. The girlfriend shared an experiment she learned in class, and the guy said the conclusion was obvious. She got hurt because he used the word \"obviously,\" feeling it made her look dumb. He argues that the conclusion really is obvious, especially since she's a psych major, and he didn't mean it in a snarky way. The girl is upset and wants an apology, but he doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" From what I know, that word is often seen as dismissive. Even if said without malice, it can come off as condescending. The guy might not have intended to hurt her, but the effect is there. The girl expressed that it made her feel stupid. Emotional impact matters in relationships. Even if he didn't mean to, his words caused hurt feelings. \n\nHe also mentioned that he doesn't think her feelings should have been hurt. That might be a part of the problem. Dismissing her feelings by saying she shouldn't be offended could make her feel invalidated. When someone is upset, acknowledging their feelings is important, even if you don't see why they're upset. By saying \"I don't care\" and telling her to get over it, he's not showing empathy. \n\nThe argument here is whether the word \"obvious\" was objectively offensive. The guy might think it's just stating a fact, but in communication, the way something is said can matter more than the words themselves. The girlfriend's perspective is that she found the experiment cool when she first learned it, and it wasn't obvious to her at the time. His comment could have undermined her experience. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's feelings. Even if the guy didn't intend to be hurtful, the fact that his girlfriend felt hurt is significant. Apologizing isn't just about admitting fault but showing care and willingness to make things right. By refusing to apologize, he might be damaging the emotional connection. \n\nAlso, the girl's reaction isn't just about the word \"obvious\"\u2014it's about feeling belittled in a subject she's studying. That could affect her confidence and how she perceives his support. The guy's insistence that it's not a big deal might minimize her valid emotional response. \n\nSo, considering communication styles, empathy, and the importance of validating a partner's feelings, even if unintentionally hurtful, the guy is likely in the wrong here. The key points are the use of \"obviously,\" his dismissal of her feelings, and the refusal to apologize despite her being hurt.\n"
