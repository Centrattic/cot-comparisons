The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user said the experiment's conclusion was obvious, and the girlfriend felt that made her feel dumb. The user thought it obvious because it's a well-known concept, and as a psych major, maybe they expected her to know it. But the girlfriend didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned it, so the user's comment hurt her feelings.\n\nThe user is arguing that the word \"obviously\" wasn't meant to be offensive, and they don't think the girlfriend should take it so personally. They also mention that they don't care about people's feelings in such cases and think the girlfriend should just move on. But the girlfriend is hurt and wants an apology, which the user is reluctant to give.\n\nHmm. The key here is about communication and empathy. Using \"obviously\" can indeed come off as dismissive, even if not intended. The user might not realize that their partner's emotional response is valid. Even if the concept is well-known, the girlfriend might have felt that her experience or effort in learning it was undervalued. The user's response of \"I don't care\" about her feelings suggests a lack of empathy, which could be part of the problem. Validating someone's feelings, even if you don't agree with their reaction, is important in relationships. The user's insistence that the girlfriend should just get over it might be seen as insensitive. So, while the user didn't mean to hurt, the impact was there, and the way they responded afterward likely made it worse. So, they might be at fault for not acknowledging her feelings and being dismissive in their response.\n"
