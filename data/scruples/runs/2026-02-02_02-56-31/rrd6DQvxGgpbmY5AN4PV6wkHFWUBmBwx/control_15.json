The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend and her boyfriend discussing a psychology experiment. The boyfriend said the conclusion was \"obvious,\" which upset her because she felt it made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author used the word \"obviously,\" which the girlfriend found offensive. The author argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known it. However, the girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether using \"obviously\" was wrong. Even if the conclusion is well-known, using such a word can come off as dismissive. The author's intention wasn't snarky, but intentions don't always align with the impact. The girlfriend's feelings were hurt, and the author dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and not apologizing, which seems like a problem.\n\nThe author also mentions that the girlfriend kept explaining why the word was offensive, but he kept pushing back. When the girlfriend says that the author invalidated her feelings by not accepting her perspective, that's a red flag. Relationships require empathy and validation, even if you don't see the issue the same way. The author's response of telling her to not get offended over little things shows a lack of consideration for her emotional state.\n\nEven if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the impact is what matters here. The girlfriend felt stupid, and the author's refusal to apologize or acknowledge her feelings makes it worse. The fact that he's a psych major might mean he should be more aware of how language affects people. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while maybe not malicious, did hurt his girlfriend. His response of dismissing her feelings and not apologizing is definitely wrong. The right thing would have been to apologize and validate her feelings, even if he didn't see the issue initially. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
