The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with his girlfriend, which hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author said the conclusion was obvious, not in a snarky way. His girlfriend, a psychology major, felt offended because she didn't find it obvious at first. She felt the word made her feel dumb. The author thinks he's not wrong because the conclusion is well-known and he assumed she would know it as a psych major.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The use of \"obviously\" is often seen as dismissive. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the effect on the girlfriend was negative. She felt hurt and stupid. The author's main argument is that it wasn't a big deal and that he doesn't think he's wrong. But the problem is that he dismissed her feelings and didn't validate her reaction.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important. She was a psych major, but maybe she learned the experiment in a context where the conclusion wasn't immediately obvious. The author's assumption that she should have known it was obvious might have been incorrect. Even if the conclusion is well-known, it's possible she encountered it in a different light. The key issue is the emotional impact.\n\nThe author's response to her feelings was to say \"I don't care\" and that she shouldn't get offended by small things. That's a problem because it shows a lack of empathy. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, the way he responded invalidated her emotions. Healthy relationships require considering the other person's feelings, even if you don't see the issue the same way.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author could have chosen his words more carefully. Using \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. Even if the conclusion was obvious to him, he should have considered her perspective. His dismissive reaction to her hurt feelings is problematic. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not being considerate of her feelings and not apologizing.\n"
