The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment she found interesting. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, and the experiment's conclusion was clear to the user. They said it was obvious, which made the girlfriend feel dumb. The user argues that the conclusion is well-known and that as a psych major, she should have found it obvious. But the girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned it.\n\nSo, communication is key here. The word \"obviously\" can sometimes come off as dismissive, even if not intended. Even if the user didn't mean to be snarky, using that word might have made her feel like her experience wasn't valued. The user's response of \"I don't care\" when she explained her feelings probably didn't help. It's important to validate someone's feelings, even if you don't see eye to eye. \n\nThe user is defending their use of the word, thinking it was justified because the conclusion is common knowledge. But the girlfriend's reaction shows that she felt invalidated. Even if the user doesn't see the issue, the impact on her feelings matters. Relationships require empathy and understanding, so dismissing her feelings as being too sensitive might be where the user is wrong. \n\nAlso, the user is refusing to apologize, which can be a problem. Apologizing isn't about admitting guilt in a legal sense but showing that you care about the other person's feelings. The user says they are sorry but don't think it was a big deal, which might not be sufficient. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the user might not have intended to hurt her, but the word used had a negative effect. Not validating her feelings and refusing to acknowledge her perspective could mean the user is in the wrong. Even if the conclusion is obvious, the way it was communicated was hurtful. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
