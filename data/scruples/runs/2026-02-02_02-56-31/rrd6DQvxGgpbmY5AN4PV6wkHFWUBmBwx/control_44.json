The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author said something was \"obviously\" the case during a conversation with their girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend took offense to the word \"obviously,\" feeling that it made her feel dumb and hurt her feelings. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that \"obviously\" can be a trigger word for some people because it can come off as dismissive or condescending. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the intention versus the impact might matter here. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she's more sensitive to how communication affects others, given her field of study. The author, however, argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known that. But the key point here is that she didn't find it obvious at the time she learned it. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have undermined her experience of learning it for the first time.\n\nThe author downplays the situation by saying they don't think it was a big deal and even say they don't care that the word can be offensive. They also mention not apologizing because they believe they didn't do anything wrong. However, the girlfriend is hurt and wants an apology. The author's response of \"I don't care\" when the girlfriend explains how the word affected her could be seen as invalidating her feelings. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the impact is real, and dismissing her feelings might have made things worse.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's refusal to acknowledge the hurt feelings and insistence that it's not a big deal might be the bigger issue here. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was communicated could have been different. Using \"obviously\" might not have been necessary. Also, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt, and the author's response to her feelings (saying \"I don't care\") shows a lack of empathy, which is a red flag in relationships.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because they dismissed their girlfriend's feelings and didn't take responsibility for how their words affected her, even if the word \"obviously\" wasn't used with malicious intent. The refusal to apologize and the invalidation of her emotions are problematic. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
