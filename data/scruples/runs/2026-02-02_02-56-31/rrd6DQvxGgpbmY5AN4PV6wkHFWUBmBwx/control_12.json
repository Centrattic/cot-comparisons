The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for hurting his girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" in their conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author and his girlfriend were discussing a psychology experiment. The author found the conclusion obvious and said so, using the word \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt offended because she didn't know it was obvious to her when she first learned it, and the word made her feel dumb. The author thinks it was safe to assume she knew it was obvious since she's a psych major, and he doesn't think he was wrong to use the word. He even said \"I don't care\" when she explained her feelings, which led to more conflict. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the use of \"obviously,\" the girlfriend's reaction, and the author's response to her feelings.\n\nUsing the word \"obviously\" can be seen as dismissive. Even if the author didn't mean it snarkily, the word itself can imply that the other person should know the information, which might make them feel inadequate. The girlfriend, as a psych major, might have learned the experiment but not have realized it was a well-known concept. Maybe the context or her personal experience made it less obvious to her at the time. The author's assumption that it should be obvious to her might not account for her individual perspective.\n\nThe author's response to her feelings is another factor. When she explained why the word hurt her, he said \"I don't care.\" That's pretty dismissive. Even if he didn't intend to be, he's invalidating her feelings by not acknowledging their importance. Relationships require empathy and validation. Telling someone to \"get over it\" when they're upset isn't helpful. It's important to listen, even if you don't fully understand why something is hurtful.\n\nThe author also argues that he wouldn't be offended if she said something similar to him. But that's a classic \"I wouldn't react that way\" argument, which doesn't take into account that people's sensitivities can differ. What's important is how the other person is feeling, not how you'd feel in the same situation.\n\nSo, while the author might not have had malicious intent, his use of the word and his subsequent dismissal of her feelings likely contributed to the hurt. In relationships, communication and empathy are key. Even if the concept was obvious, the way it was communicated could be improved. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should consider apologizing to show that he cares about her emotions, even if he doesn't see it as a big issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
