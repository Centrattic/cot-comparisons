The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend feeling hurt because he used the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author said the conclusion was obvious, which he believed it was, given that it's a well-known concept. However, the girlfriend felt that the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb, even though she's a psych major. She didn't find it obvious at the time she learned it, so his comment was hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are about sensitivity in communication. Even if the author didn't intend to be dismissive, using \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. People's feelings about being told something is obvious can vary. The girlfriend took it as an insult to her intelligence, which is a valid emotional response. The author's insistence that he didn't mean it that way and his refusal to apologize, even after acknowledging he hurt her feelings, might be problematic.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings, even if you don't see the issue. The author's response of \"I don't care\" when she explained her hurt feelings suggests a lack of willingness to empathize. Even if he doesn't personally find the word offensive, the fact that it affected her negatively is significant. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling respected and valued, not just about the factual obviousness of the conclusion.\n\nThe author's stance that she should \"get over it\" and not take offense to small things is dismissive of her emotional experience. In healthy relationships, both partners should make an effort to avoid hurting each other and to apologize when necessary. The author's refusal to apologize might indicate a pattern of not respecting her feelings, which could be the root of the issue here.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because he failed to acknowledge the impact of his words on his girlfriend's feelings and didn't take her concerns seriously enough. Even if the word \"obviously\" isn't inherently offensive, the context and the recipient's sensitivity matter. The right approach would be to apologize and be more mindful in the future.\n"
