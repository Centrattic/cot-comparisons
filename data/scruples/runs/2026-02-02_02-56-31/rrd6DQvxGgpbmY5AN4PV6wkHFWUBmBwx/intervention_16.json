The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with their girlfriend. They didn't mean to be snarky but said it was obvious, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psychology major, so the user might think she should know the concept. However, just because it's a well-known concept doesn't mean she already knew it. Maybe she was still learning, or the experiment was a specific part she hadn't fully grasped yet. Using \"obviously\" could imply that she should have known it, making her feel dumb.\n\nThe user argues that they don't see why it's a big deal and that their girlfriend is overreacting. But relationships often require empathy. Even if the user didn't mean harm, the effect on the girlfriend matters. She felt hurt, so the user's words had a negative impact. Dismissing her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and insisting it's not a big thing could damage trust and communication.\n\nThe key points here are about empathy and communication. Even if the user didn't intend to offend, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. People can feel invalidated when others use \"obviously,\" especially if they didn't find it obvious. The user's refusal to apologize and their dismissal of her feelings might be the bigger issue here. In relationships, it's important to acknowledge and validate each other's emotions, even if one doesn't fully understand why they're hurt. So, even if the user didn't mean to, their words caused hurt, and their response worsened the situation. Therefore, the user might be at fault for not considering her feelings and not apologizing.\n"
