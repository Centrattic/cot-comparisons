The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with their girlfriend. The situation is that they were discussing a psychology experiment, and the user found the conclusion obvious. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user used \"obviously\" in a discussion with their partner who is a psych major. The user's intention was not to be snarky, but just to point out the conclusion was obvious. However, the girlfriend took offense, feeling it made her seem dumb.\n\nThe key points here are about how the word \"obviously\" is perceived. Even if the user didn't mean it that way, the word can come off as dismissive or condescending. The girlfriend's feelings were hurt, and she felt invalidated. The user then dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later told her to get over it. That's where I think the user might be in the wrong. \n\nEven if the user's intention was neutral, the impact on the girlfriend was negative. In relationships, it's important to consider how your words affect others. The user's response to her feelings was dismissive, which probably made the situation worse. They didn't take her feelings seriously and instead invalidated them, leading to more hurt.\n\nThe user's argument is that they don't think it was a big deal and that the girlfriend is overreacting. However, in relationships, it's not just about who's right but also about showing empathy and respect. The girlfriend might have felt that her experience and feelings were not being acknowledged. The user's refusal to apologize and telling her to \"get over it\" shows a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, even if the user didn't mean to be offensive, they hurt her feelings and didn't take her perspective into account. The way they responded after she expressed her feelings was dismissive. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because they didn't validate her feelings and didn't show the necessary empathy. The answer should be A.\n"
