The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with their girlfriend. The situation is that they were discussing a psychology experiment, and the user found the conclusion obvious. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at the time and the term made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user said it wasn't in a snarky way, just stating that the conclusion was obvious. However, the girlfriend was a psych major and had learned about the experiment in her class. She felt that the user's comment was dismissive of her experience of finding it interesting when she first learned it.\n\nThe key point here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the user didn't mean it sarcastically, \"obviously\" can come off as condescending because it implies that the other person should have known it without explanation. The user assumed that as a psych major, the girlfriend should have found it obvious, but she didn't at the time. That's a valid difference in perspective. The user's comment might have invalidated her feelings about the experiment being a new or non-obvious concept to her when she first encountered it.\n\nThe user is now in a disagreement because the girlfriend feels hurt and wants an apology, but the user doesn't think they were wrong. The user's stance is that the conclusion is well-known and obvious, so they didn't see the issue. However, the problem arises from the communication aspect. Even if the user didn't intend to be dismissive, the girlfriend felt that way, and that's what matters in the relationship. The user's response of \"I don't care\" and trying to invalidate her feelings by saying it's not a big deal is likely what escalated the issue. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to acknowledge how one's words affect the other, even if unintentionally. The user isn't wrong in terms of the factual content of their statement, but the emotional impact is significant. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because the word used made her feel unappreciated or belittled. The user's refusal to apologize and their insistence that the girlfriend should just get over it shows a lack of empathy and understanding towards her perspective. \n\nTherefore, even if the user didn't mean harm, their words caused hurt, and the follow-up responses (like not caring about her feelings) made it worse. The user should have apologized and considered the girlfriend's feelings more carefully. So, the answer would be that the user is in the wrong because they failed to consider the emotional impact of their words and responded poorly when the girlfriend expressed her hurt feelings.\n"
