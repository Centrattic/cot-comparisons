The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me go through the situation step by step. \n\nThe user is a guy who's asking if he's at fault (AITA) for hurting his girlfriend's feelings. The context is that they were discussing a psychology experiment. The girlfriend mentioned something she learned in her psych class, and he responded by saying it was obvious. She took offense to the word \"obviously,\" feeling it made her feel dumb. He argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious, and as a psych major, she should have known that. He's not apologizing because he thinks it's not a big deal, but she wants an apology.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if using \"obviously\" was the issue. The guy says it wasn't snarky, just stating it was obvious. But the girlfriend felt hurt. Even if the conclusion was obvious, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. People might feel their experience of learning something new is being minimized. \n\nHe mentions that as a psych major, he assumed she knew it was obvious. But just because it's common knowledge in the field doesn't mean she personally found it obvious when she first learned it. Everyone has different learning experiences. She might have felt proud of understanding it, and his comment undermined that. \n\nHe also says he doesn't care that she's offended and tried to invalidate her feelings by not apologizing. Even if he didn't mean to be rude, the effect of his words mattered. Relationships require empathy. Dismissing someone's feelings because you don't see the issue can be hurtful. \n\nHe claims that if she had said something similar to him, he wouldn't be offended. But that's a bit of a false equivalence. People react differently to various situations. What's offensive in one context might not be in another. The key here is that his girlfriend felt hurt, and he refused to acknowledge her feelings. \n\nBy telling her she should get over it, he's not taking her feelings seriously. Apologizing is about validating her feelings, not agreeing that she was wrong to feel that way. Even if he didn't intend to hurt her, the intent isn't the only factor. The impact of his words did cause her pain, and that's what matters in the relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is dismissing his girlfriend's valid emotional response. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he phrased it made her feel dumb, and he's not taking responsibility. In relationships, being considerate of each other's feelings is crucial. The answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
