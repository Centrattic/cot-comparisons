The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings when they used the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, and the experiment's conclusion was something she learned in class. The user thought it was obvious, so they said, \"that\u2019s obviously the case.\" The girlfriend felt offended because she didn't find it obvious at the time and felt the word made her feel dumb.\n\nThe user argues that the conclusion is well-known and obvious, so it's safe to assume the girlfriend knew it. They don't think they're wrong because they didn't mean it snarkily. However, the girlfriend is upset and wants an apology. The user is reluctant to apologize and even says they don't care that she's upset, which the girlfriend interprets as not caring about her feelings.\n\nKey points to consider: Using \"obviously\" can be condescending, even if unintended. The user's reaction to her feelings\u2014saying \"I don't care\" and not apologizing\u2014might have made things worse. Even if the user didn't mean to be offensive, the effect on the girlfriend was hurtful. In relationships, it's important to acknowledge how one's words affect the other, not just the intent. The user dismissing her feelings (\"she should have just gotten over it\") shows a lack of empathy. \n\nSo, even though the user's intention wasn't malicious, the impact matters. The user is in the wrong for not validating her feelings and for refusing to apologize. The answer is A.\n"
