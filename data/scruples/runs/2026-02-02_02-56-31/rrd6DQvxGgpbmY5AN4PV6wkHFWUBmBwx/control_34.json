The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a disagreement between the author and their girlfriend over the use of the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's girlfriend was excited about an experiment she learned about in her psych class, and the author responded that the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt hurt and dumb because the author used the word \"obviously,\" even though the author didn't mean it in a snarky way. The author argues that the conclusion is well-known and that as a psych major, the girlfriend should have known it was obvious. However, the girlfriend felt that the author was dismissing her experience of learning something new and exciting.\n\nNow, considering social norms and communication in relationships. The word \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive, even when not intended that way. People have different levels of prior knowledge and can find things obvious or not based on their experiences. The girlfriend might have felt that her effort or the excitement she had about learning the concept was being undermined. The author's insistence that it was obvious and that it should be obvious to her as a psych major could be seen as invalidating her feelings.\n\nThe author also mentions that the girlfriend kept explaining why \"obviously\" was offensive, and when the author responded with \"I don't care,\" that likely escalated the situation. Dismissing someone's feelings, even if you disagree with them, can be hurtful. The author's refusal to apologize and their stance that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" and not be offended by small things seems dismissive of her emotional experience.\n\nIn relationships, emotional validation is important. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the girlfriend felt hurt, and the way the author responded to her feelings (invalidating them) probably made her feel unappreciated. The key here is that the author is not acknowledging the girlfriend's perspective, which is a common issue in conflicts where one person's feelings are overlooked.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong. They used language that was perceived as dismissive, then didn't validate their partner's feelings when she expressed being hurt. The right approach would have been to apologize and acknowledge that even if the conclusion seemed obvious, using \"obviously\" might have been insensitive. The author's insistence on their own perspective without empathy is problematic here.\n"
