The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple discussing a psychology experiment. The girlfriend is a psych major and talks about an experiment, and the guy says the conclusion is obvious. She takes offense because he used \"obviously,\" making her feel dumb. He thinks she's overreacting and refuses to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The key points are the use of the word \"obviously\" and the emotional response. The author argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious, especially since she's a psych major, so he thought it was safe to use that word. However, she felt hurt because she didn't see it as obvious at the time she learned it.\n\nIn communication, using terms like \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive or condescending, especially in personal relationships. Even if the author didn't intend to be snarky, the impact on the listener matters. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt belittled. The author's response of not caring about her feelings, despite saying he does, shows a lack of empathy which can be damaging in a relationship.\n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that she shouldn't get upset over \"little things\" might be problematic. It's important to validate others' feelings even if you don't fully understand why they're upset. The fact that he invalidated her feelings by not apologizing and told her to get over it suggests he's not fully considering her perspective. \n\nEven if the conclusion was obvious to him, the key here is that she didn't find it obvious at the time. People can have different experiences and levels of understanding, especially in academic contexts. The author's assumption that she should have found it obvious because of her major could be part of the issue. It's possible he underestimated her feelings and overestimated his own understanding of her perspective.\n\nIn relationships, maintaining emotional support is crucial. Dismissing someone's feelings can lead to trust issues and hurt. The author might not think he was wrong, but his actions caused hurt, and his response to it by not apologizing exacerbates the problem. The girlfriend's need for an apology is about feeling respected and heard, which are important in maintaining a healthy relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author's intention wasn't malicious, his words and subsequent lack of apology and empathy likely made him at fault here. The answer is A.\n"
