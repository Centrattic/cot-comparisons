The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their girlfriend feeling hurt when the author called a psychological experiment's conclusion \"obvious.\"\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author didn't mean to be snarky but used the word \"obviously,\" which the girlfriend found offensive. She's a psych major and found the experiment cool when she first learned it, not obvious. The author, however, thought it was obvious and assumed she would have known that. The girlfriend felt stupid, and the author is now refusing to apologize, saying it's not a big deal.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about communication and empathy. Even if the author didn't intend to be dismissive, using \"obviously\" can come across as belittling, especially in a relationship. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt hurt. The fact that she's a psych major might mean she's familiar with the concept, but everyone's experience with material can vary. Just because it's common knowledge doesn't mean it's obvious to everyone at every moment.\n\nThe author's response to the girlfriend's feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and insisting she should get over it is problematic. Validating someone's feelings is important in a relationship. Even if the author thinks the issue is trivial, dismissing the girlfriend's emotions can damage trust and intimacy. The author's refusal to apologize and minimize the situation might indicate a lack of empathy, which is a red flag in relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't malicious. They didn't use the word in a mean way, just stated their opinion. But in relationships, it's about how the other person feels, not just intent. The key here is whether the author should adjust their communication to avoid hurting their partner, even if they don't see the issue. Relationships require compromise and understanding.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions, while not malicious, did hurt their girlfriend. The refusal to apologize and the dismissive attitude towards her feelings suggest that the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
