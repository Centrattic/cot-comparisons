The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the given scenario is in the wrong. The author used the word \"obviously\" while discussing an experiment with their girlfriend, who is a psych major. The girlfriend felt hurt and thought the word was offensive because it made her feel dumb. The author doesn't think they're wrong and refuses to apologize, even though they acknowledge that \"obviously\" can be offensive in general.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The girlfriend is a psych major, so she might have expected the experiment's conclusion to be something she already knew. However, the author's use of \"obviously\" could come off as dismissive. Even if the conclusion was common knowledge, the way it was phrased might have been condescending. The girlfriend felt her feelings were hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it. The author's response that they don't care about her feelings, even though they say they do, is problematic because it invalidates her emotions.\n\nCommunication in relationships often hinges on how something is said, not just the content. The key here is whether the author's intention and the impact on the girlfriend align. The author thought it was safe to assume it was obvious to her, but the girlfriend's reaction shows it wasn't. The author dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care,\" which exacerbates the situation. Even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the effect was there, and the appropriate response would be empathy and an apology, not defensiveness.\n\nThe author's stance that the girlfriend should just get over it is not considering the emotional aspect. In relationships, acknowledging and validating each other's feelings is crucial. The author's refusal to apologize and their assertion that it's not a big thing undermines the importance of emotional sensitivity. So, while the author might not have intended to be offensive, their actions and responses contributed to the hurt, making them at least partially responsible.\n"
