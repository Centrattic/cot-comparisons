We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their husband, mother, and daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The daughter has a history of depression and has been making progress in her recovery. She moved in with her parents and is now doing well with a job, school, and therapy. However, she's a bit messy, which the husband is annoyed about. The mother and husband criticized the daughter in front of her, especially about the cat's litter box, and didn't apologize when the daughter was upset. The author lost their temper, told them to \"fuck off,\" and took the daughter to calm down. Now the author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's mental health, being criticized in front of her, the parents not apologizing, and the author's reaction. The author's main concern is protecting their daughter's mental health. The husband and mother's actions might have been contributing to the daughter's stress, which could set her back in her recovery.\n\nThe author's outburst was in response to the criticism being directed at their daughter. The question is whether that reaction was justified. On one hand, yelling and using strong language could be seen as inappropriate. On the other hand, the context is that the daughter's mental health is at stake, and the parents were being unkind. The author is trying to defend their daughter.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the parents (husband and mother) might be at fault for targeting the daughter during a vulnerable moment. The author's reaction was a defense of their daughter, which could be seen as justified given the circumstances. However, the method of responding with a harsh outburst might complicate things. But the underlying motivation is protective.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms too. In some cultures, defending a family member might be seen as the right thing to do, even if the method is harsh. In others, maintaining composure is valued. But the key here is the daughter's well-being. The author's action, while strong, was to prevent further harm to their daughter's mental health.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their actions were in defense of their daughter's mental health, even if the method was harsh. The husband and mother's behavior was the initial issue.\n"
