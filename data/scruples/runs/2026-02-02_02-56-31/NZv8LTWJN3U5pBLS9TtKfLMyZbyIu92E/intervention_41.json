We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband in front of their daughter. The situation involves their 26-year-old daughter who's recovering from depression and dealing with a lot of responsibilities. The daughter has a cat, and the parents and mother-in-law criticized her for not cleaning the litter box, which upset the daughter. The user lost their temper, told them to be respectful or \"fuck off,\" and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is doing well despite her challenges, but her messiness is a point of contention. The parents and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, which led to her emotional breakdown. The user intervened to protect her, but using harsh language. \n\nThe user's actions were a reaction to their daughter's emotional pain. The parents and mother-in-law's approach might have been insensitive, especially given the daughter's mental health history. The user's outburst was to defend their daughter, but the method might be questioned. However, the intention was protective. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about context. Protecting a vulnerable family member from public criticism that could harm their mental health is understandable. The user's frustration was justified by their concern. On the other hand, using profanity and cutting off communication might not be the best approach, but the intent was to protect their daughter. \n\nSo, considering the emotional impact on the daughter and the parents' failure to apologize, the user's reaction, while harsh, was in response to a harmful situation. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong. But this is a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. However, the user's action was a direct response to protect their daughter from further harm, which is a strong point in their favor.\n"
