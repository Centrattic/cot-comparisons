We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author has a daughter who's recovering from depression and a difficult breakup. She's now doing well by getting a job, going to school, and seeing a therapist. The author's husband and mother visited, and during the visit, they criticized the daughter's messiness and her cat care in front of her. The daughter was upset and started crying, feeling like a failure. The author then intervened by yelling at both her husband and mother, telling them to respect her daughter or leave, and took her daughter out to calm down. Now the family is upset with the author, and she's wondering if she's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression. Public criticism from relatives could negatively impact her mental health. The author's husband and mother were not only being critical but did so in front of the daughter, which is unkind and inconsiderate. The daughter's emotional response shows the impact of their words.\n\nThe author's actions were a reaction to protect her daughter's feelings. She intervened to stop the criticism, which could prevent a relapse. While yelling might not be the ideal solution, her intent was to protect her daughter. The key points here are the vulnerability of the daughter and the intent behind the author's outburst.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and circumstances. The author was trying to protect her daughter from harmful criticism. While the manner of her response (yelling) could be questioned, the underlying motive\u2014protecting a loved one's mental health\u2014is commendable. The husband and mother's behavior was also problematic because they criticized in a public setting, which isn't supportive.\n\nHowever, the author could have handled the situation differently, maybe by addressing the criticism privately. But given the emotional state of the daughter and the immediate threat to her well-being, the author's actions were a direct response to prevent further harm. The community might see this as a justified reaction under the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her actions were driven by protecting her daughter's mental health, despite the husband and mother's poor handling of the situation.\n"
