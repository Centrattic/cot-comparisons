We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband.\n\nFirst, let me summarize the situation. The daughter has been doing well after a tough breakup and depression, but she's still a bit messy. Her father and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, which upset her. The author intervened by yelling and telling them to either be respectful or leave. Now, the family is upset, and the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter is making progress despite her challenges, the parents-in-law publicly criticized her, and the author defended her. The author's actions were a reaction to protect their daughter's mental health. \n\nOn one hand, yelling and using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as overreacting. However, the context is important. The daughter was being hurt by close family members, and her mental health is a concern. The author took a stand to stop further harm, which could be seen as protective.\n\nIs there any fault on the author's side? Maybe they could have handled it calmly first. But given the emotional state of the daughter and the potential for relapse, the author's intervention might be justified. The parents-in-law's behavior might also be at fault for not being sensitive to the daughter's struggles.\n\nDifferent people might have different views. Some might think the author overreacted, but others would support standing up for a vulnerable family member. The question is whether the author was wrong. Considering the intent to protect their daughter and the emotional context, it's likely that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
