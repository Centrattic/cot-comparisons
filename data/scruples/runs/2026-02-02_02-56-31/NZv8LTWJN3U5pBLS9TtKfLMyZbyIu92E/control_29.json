We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter with depression who's making progress but is being criticized by her father and mother-in-law, leading to the mother defending her.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been through a tough time with a bad relationship and depression. She's now working and in school, which is a big improvement. The husband and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, which was hurtful. The mother in the story stepped in to defend her daughter, telling them to stop or leave. \n\nThe question is whether her outburst was wrong. On one hand, she was protecting her daughter from harmful criticism, especially considering the daughter's mental health. Publicly shaming someone with depression could set her back. The mother taking a stand might be justified to prevent emotional harm.\n\nOn the other hand, using strong language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as overreacting. But given the context\u2014daughter crying, feeling like \"a piece of shit\"\u2014the mother's reaction could be a necessary intervention to stop further damage. The husband and mother-in-law weren't apologizing, so the mother acted to comfort her daughter.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like she was protecting her child's mental health, which is a strong motive. The method was harsh but the intent was good. So maybe answer B (Not in the wrong) because she prioritized her daughter's well-being.\n"
