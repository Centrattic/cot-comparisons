We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author losing their temper and telling their mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they criticized the author's daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The daughter has a history of depression and has been making significant progress, like getting a job and going to school. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy, specifically about taking care of a cat, in front of her. The daughter was upset, and the husband didn't apologize. The author then confronted them, leading to the heated response.\n\nNow, evaluating the author's actions. The key points are: protecting a vulnerable family member (the daughter's mental health), the public criticism from husband and mother, and the resulting outburst. The author's intent was to defend their daughter from what they perceived as unjust criticism, especially since the daughter was already struggling. The husband and mother's actions were inconsiderate, given the daughter's recent progress and mental health history. The author's reaction, while harsh, might be seen as a defense mechanism to protect someone they care about. \n\nHowever, using such strong language (\"fuck off\") could be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent was good. The author might be in the right for standing up for their daughter but in the wrong for the manner in which they did it. But in the context of the daughter's well-being and the public humiliation, some might argue the outburst was justified as a last resort. The question is whether the means (yelling and using that language) were proportionate to the situation. \n\nConsidering the daughter's mental health and the public criticism from the husband and mother, the author's actions could be seen as a necessary defense to prevent further harm. The husband's failure to apologize and the mother's continued criticism likely escalated the situation. The author's outburst might be more about protecting their daughter than being the asshole, even if the language was harsh. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they were defending their daughter's mental health from harmful criticism, even if the method was strong. The key is the context of the daughter's vulnerability and the public shaming by the husband and mother.\n"
