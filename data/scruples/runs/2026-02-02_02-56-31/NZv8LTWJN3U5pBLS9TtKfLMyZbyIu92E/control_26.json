We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault. The situation involves a conflict between the mother, father, and daughter over the daughter's messiness. The key points are:\n\n1. The daughter is doing well after depression, has a job, is in school, and in therapy. The daughter's progress is important here.\n2. The mother and husband criticized the daughter in front of her, specifically about her cat's litter box. This happened in front of the daughter, causing her emotional distress.\n3. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset. The mother continued the criticism, leading the author to snap and tell them to \"fuck off\" or leave.\n4. The daughter was crying and felt awful, repeating that everyone thinks she's a piece of shit. The author then comforts her and takes her out, leading to a rift with the mother and husband.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The mother and husband were publicly criticizing the daughter, which is unkind, especially given her history of depression. Public shaming can have a negative impact on mental health. The author intervened to protect their daughter, which is a protective act. The mother and husband's behavior seems to be the initial problem here.\n\nThe author's outburst was a reaction to the ongoing criticism in front of their daughter. While yelling and using strong language isn't ideal, the intent was to stop the abuse. The daughter's emotional state is a key factor here. The author was trying to prevent further harm to her mental health.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They took a stand to defend their daughter, which is understandable. The mother and husband's actions were the root issue. The author's actions, while harsh, were in response to protect their child. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
