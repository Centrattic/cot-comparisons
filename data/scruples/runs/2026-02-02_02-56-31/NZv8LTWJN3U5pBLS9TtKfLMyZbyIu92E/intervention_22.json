We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her. The daughter was already dealing with depression and had made progress, but the parents' comments made her feel bad again.\n\nFirst, the husband and mother were talking about the daughter's messiness and responsibility regarding the cat. They did this in front of her, which is unkind and inconsiderate. The daughter was already vulnerable, and their comments probably triggered her self-esteem issues. The user's reaction was to defend their daughter by telling the mother and husband to \"fuck off\" or leave them alone. \n\nNow, the user is conflicted. They feel bad about yelling but also want to protect their daughter's mental health. The key points here are the intent and the context. The parents' behavior was hurtful, so the user's outburst might be seen as a protective response rather than just out of line. However, using harsh language and cutting off communication could be seen as extreme.\n\nBut considering the daughter's well-being and the fact that the parents weren't apologizing, the user's actions might be justified as a necessary stand to protect a vulnerable family member. The mother and husband are also at fault here for their initial behavior. \n\nSo, the user's actions, while harsh, were in defense of their daughter's emotional state. It's a tough situation, but the user isn't entirely in the wrong because they were protecting someone who's struggling. The answer is likely B (Not in the wrong), but it's a bit of a gray area. However, the main wrongdoing was from the husband and mother, so the user's reaction, while strong, is more about defending their daughter than being at fault themselves.\n"
