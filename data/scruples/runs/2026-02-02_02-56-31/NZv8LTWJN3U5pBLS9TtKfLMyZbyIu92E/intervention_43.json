We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after yelling at their mother and husband for criticizing their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, the daughter was already dealing with depression and had made a lot of progress. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which is pretty harsh. The daughter was clearly hurt, crying, and feeling like a \"piece of shit.\" The user stepped in to defend her, which makes sense because the daughter's mental health is a big concern here.\n\nThe question is whether the user overreacted. They yelled and told them to \"fuck off,\" which is a strong reaction. But given the context\u2014protecting a vulnerable daughter from public shaming and potential harm to her mental health\u2014maybe it's understandable. The parents weren't just giving constructive feedback; they were berating her in front of others, which can be really damaging.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's approach was aggressive. Yelling might not be the best way to handle things, and it's causing tension in their relationships with the mother and husband. The user hasn't reached out to reconcile, which could indicate they're still upset or don't know how to address it.\n\nSo, the key points are: protecting a daughter's mental health vs. the method used. The intent was good\u2014to defend the daughter\u2014but the means were harsh. The husband and mother also have issues for being unkind in front of her. But the user's own outburst might not be the right approach, even if their intentions were good. \n\nIt's a tough spot. The user is in a position where they feel they have to defend their daughter, but the way they did it might be seen as overstepping. However, given the daughter's vulnerability, maybe the user's actions are justified. It's a balance between protecting the daughter and handling the situation calmly. \n\nI think the user's actions were in response to a harmful situation, so maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. But the method could have been better. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether their method is ideal. Since they were trying to protect their daughter from emotional harm, their actions might be seen as a last resort. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because of the context of protecting a daughter's mental health.\n"
