We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her. The situation is pretty intense. So, the daughter has been doing a lot of good things after a tough breakup and depression, but the husband is annoyed by her messiness and brought it up in front of her. The mother joined in, and the daughter ended up crying.\n\nThe user intervened by yelling at both of them, telling them to leave or fuck off. Now they're feeling bad about it but also concerned for their daughter's mental health. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, overcoming depression. Public criticism from family members could really impact her. The husband and mother were being disrespectful, which is not okay. The user stepped in to protect their daughter, which seems like a good intention. But the method was aggressive\u2014yelling and using a strong swear word. \n\nHowever, the key here is the context. The daughter was already struggling, and the parents and husband's actions could set her back. The user's anger was a reaction to protect their child. While yelling is intense, the intent was to stop the harm. In some cases, people might say that the user's reaction was justified given the circumstances. \n\nOn the other hand, using that kind of language might have made things worse. It could damage relationships. But the user is also in a position where they felt their child was being attacked. So, the question is whether their reaction was proportionate. \n\nI think in this case, the user's actions were more about protecting their daughter's mental health than being disrespectful. They did take their daughter to get food and calm down, which shows they wanted to help. So, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Like, maybe the user should have handled it differently without yelling. But given the emotional state of their daughter and the immediate threat from the others, maybe it's understandable.\n"
