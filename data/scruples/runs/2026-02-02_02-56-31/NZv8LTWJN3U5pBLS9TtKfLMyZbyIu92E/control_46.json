We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their daughter's messiness being criticized in front of her by her husband and mom. The daughter was already dealing with depression and had made a lot of progress, which the author is proud of. The husband and mother-in-law started berating her in front of her, which led the daughter to feel really bad and cry. The author got angry and told them both to fuck off, then left with the daughter. Now they're all mad at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a history of depression and was doing well. Public criticism from family members could set her back. The author intervened to protect her daughter's mental health. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was hurt, which is a red flag. The mother-in-law and husband were being disrespectful in front of the daughter, which isn't appropriate. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect her child.\n\nBut, the author did use harsh language (\"fuck off\") which is aggressive. However, the situation was emotionally charged, and the daughter was being criticized in a harmful way. The author's main motivation was to defend their daughter, which is understandable. The husband and mother-in-law's behavior was the initial problem. So, while the author's method might not be the best, their intention was to protect their child's well-being. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key is whether the author's actions were justified. Since they were defending their daughter from emotional harm, maybe they're not in the wrong. The husband and mother-in-law were the ones who started the issue. The author's response was a reaction to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern, especially given the daughter's mental health history. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure I consider all angles. The author's tone and words were harsh, but the context is important here.\n"
