We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, the daughter has a history of depression and has been making progress. The parents are proud of her achievements, but she still has some issues like being messy. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which led to her emotional breakdown. The user intervened by telling them to stop or leave. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's mental health, the public criticism from family members, the emotional impact on the daughter, and the user's reaction. The user's main concern is protecting their daughter's well-being. \n\nFrom a general perspective, public criticism can be harmful, especially to someone recovering from depression. The user acted to defend their daughter, which shows a desire to protect her. However, the method\u2014yelling and telling them to \"fuck off\"\u2014might be seen as confrontational. But considering the context of the daughter's vulnerability, the user's actions might be understood as a necessary intervention to prevent further harm.\n\nThe husband and mother not apologizing after the daughter was clearly upset is also a problem. The user's outburst could be a justified reaction to their lack of empathy. However, the user hasn't reached out to reconcile, which might complicate things further. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's intent was protective. While the method was harsh, the situation's context (daughter's mental health) supports the action. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the user prioritized their daughter's emotional safety. But there's a nuance here about handling the situation more calmly if possible. But given the circumstances, the user's reaction is understandable.\n"
