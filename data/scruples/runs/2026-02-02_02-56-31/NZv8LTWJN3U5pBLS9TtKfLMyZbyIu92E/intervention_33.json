We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong after yelling at their mother and husband for criticizing their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, the context: The daughter has been through a tough time with depression and has made a lot of progress. She's working, going to school, and in therapy. Her parents and mother-in-law were visiting, and they started talking about her messiness and the cat's litter box in front of her. The daughter was upset, and the user's husband didn't apologize. The user then yelled at them, told them to be respectful or \"fuck off,\" and took the daughter to get food. Now, the user is feeling bad but also concerned about the daughter's mental health.\n\nSo, the key points here. The daughter is in a vulnerable state. Public criticism, especially from family, can really impact someone with a history of depression. The user stepped in to defend her daughter, which shows they care about her well-being. The parents and husband were in the wrong for berating the daughter in front of her, especially given her mental health history. The user's outburst was a reaction to protect their daughter from further harm. \n\nBut, is the user in the wrong? They used harsh language, which might be seen as inappropriate. However, the context is that they were trying to protect their child. The question is whether the method justifies the means. In some cultures or families, direct confrontation like that might be frowned upon, but given the daughter's mental health, the user's actions were to prevent further emotional damage. \n\nThe husband not apologizing is another issue. The mother and father-in-law being critical in front of the daughter, without considering her feelings, is the root problem. The user's reaction, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was in defense of their child. So, while using such language isn't ideal, the intent was protective. \n\nIn terms of accountability, maybe the user isn't the one at fault here. The parents and husband were the ones who caused the daughter to feel bad. The user intervened to stop the harm. So the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground? However, the question is strict: A or B. Given the context, the user's actions were in response to a harmful situation, so B is the answer.\n"
