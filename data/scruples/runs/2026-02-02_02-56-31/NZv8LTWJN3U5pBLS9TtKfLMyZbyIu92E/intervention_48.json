We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their husband and mother in front of their daughter. The situation involves their daughter, who has been struggling with depression but is now doing better. The daughter's messiness became a point of contention during their mother's visit. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, leading the user to lose their temper.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a history of depression and is working hard to improve. Public criticism from family members could really harm her mental health. The user's reaction was to defend their daughter, which shows they care about her well-being. However, yelling and using harsh language might not be the best approach. But was it wrong?\n\nThe key points are: the daughter's mental health is a concern, the criticism was public and hurtful, and the user intervened to protect their daughter. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued despite the daughter's emotional state. The user's outburst might have been a reaction to protect their child from further harm. \n\nOn one hand, lashing out with an F-bomb could be seen as unprofessional or harsh. On the other, it's an emotional response to defend a vulnerable family member. The user's main goal was to stop the hurtful comments, which were coming from their husband and mother. They then took their daughter out to comfort her, which is a positive action.\n\nSo, the question is whether the means (yelling) justified the end (protecting the daughter). In such cases, people often react emotionally when they feel a loved one is being attacked. The user might not be in the wrong, especially given the daughter's mental health history. However, there's a balance between standing up for someone and handling the situation calmly. \n\nConsidering all factors, the user's primary intent was protective. The husband and mother's behavior was inconsiderate, and the user took a stand. While the method could be debated, the intent seems valid. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
