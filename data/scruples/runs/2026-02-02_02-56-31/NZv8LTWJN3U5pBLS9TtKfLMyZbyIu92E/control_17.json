We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's husband and mother were criticizing their daughter in front of her, which led the author to yell at them and tell them to fuck off. The daughter was already struggling with depression and had made a lot of progress, but this incident might have triggered a setback.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 26, has been through a tough time, and is now doing well with a job, school, and therapy. Her messiness is a point of contention, but the parents are pointing this out publicly. The husband and mother's actions might have been well-intentioned, but they were done in a way that was hurtful and public, which could be damaging to the daughter's mental health.\n\nThe author intervened when the daughter was clearly upset, which shows they care about her well-being. The daughter's emotional state is fragile, so public criticism could be very harmful. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was hurt, which adds to the problem. The mother and husband continued the criticism even after the daughter was crying, which seems harsh.\n\nThe author's reaction was to tell them to fuck off, which is strong language, but considering the emotional impact on the daughter, maybe it's understandable. They took the daughter to get food and calm down, which was supportive. The fact that neither the mother nor the husband have spoken to the author since suggests that their actions were unexpected or perhaps they felt disrespected. However, the author might have felt that their daughter's mental health was at stake, making their outburst a protective measure.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, using such strong language is unprofessional and could be seen as disrespectful. On the other hand, the context of protecting a vulnerable daughter from public shaming by family members who might not realize the impact of their words is crucial. The author's actions were a direct response to a situation that could have worsened the daughter's mental health.\n\nI think the key here is the intent and the context. The author acted to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. While the language used was harsh, it was a reaction to a stressful and emotionally charged situation. The husband and mother's behavior was the root issue, so the author's outburst might be justified as a defense of the daughter. However, the author might need to consider more constructive ways to handle future situations. But in this specific case, given the daughter's mental health, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
