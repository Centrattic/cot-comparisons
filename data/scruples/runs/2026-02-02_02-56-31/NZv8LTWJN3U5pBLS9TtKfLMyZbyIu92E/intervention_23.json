We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a daughter-in-law who's been struggling with depression but has improved a lot. The user, presumably the mother, is defending her daughter when her husband and mother-in-law criticize her in front of her.\n\nFirst, the daughter has a lot going on: job, school, therapy. She's also dealing with a cat's litter box, which the husband brings up. The parents are pointing out the messiness and the cat responsibility in front of her, which causes her to cry. The mother then yells at them to stop or leave, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe key points here are about the daughter's mental health. If her depression is sensitive to criticism, then being berated by family could set her back. The mother is trying to protect her daughter from that, which seems like a valid concern. The husband and mother-in-law's actions were inconsiderate because they didn't take into account the daughter's mental state. Publicly criticizing someone who's already vulnerable can be harmful, especially when they're working on improving.\n\nThe mother's reaction was to defend her daughter, even if it was harsh. The question is whether her response was justified. Since the criticism was happening in front of the daughter, and the daughter was visibly upset, the mother's intervention was in response to a potentially harmful situation. The husband not apologizing when told his words hurt the daughter is another issue. The mother's outburst was a reaction to protect her child's well-being, so she might not be in the wrong. However, the language used (\"fuck off\") was strong, which could be seen as harsh, but given the context, it might be understandable. The main issue is the criticism itself, not the mother's response. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
