We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is dealing with depression and has made a lot of progress. The husband and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, which upset her. The user, the mother in this case, tried to console her daughter but the others continued. Then the user lost their temper and told them to \"fuck off\" or leave. Now they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nOn one hand, it's concerning that the husband and mother criticized the daughter in front of her, especially given her history with depression. The daughter's mental health is a priority here. The user's reaction might be seen as protective, trying to shield the daughter from harmful comments. Public criticism when someone is vulnerable can be really damaging, so maybe the user's outburst was a result of seeing their daughter hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might not be the best way to handle the situation. While the intent was to protect the daughter, the method could come across as disrespectful to the husband and mother. It's possible they felt the user overreacted. The user hasn't tried to resolve the conflict since then, which might be a reason for concern.\n\nBut considering the context of the daughter's mental health and the immediate emotional distress caused by the husband and mother's comments, the user's reaction might be a justified emotional response. The key here is the daughter's well-being versus the family dynamics. If the husband and mother were being unkind, the user stepping in could be seen as protecting their child.\n\nHowever, the way the user expressed their frustration could have been handled better. Perhaps a more constructive approach, like addressing the issue calmly later, might have been better. But given the immediacy of the emotional trauma the daughter experienced, the user might have acted out of necessity to stop the hurtful comments right then.\n\nI think the main factors are the daughter's mental health and the protective instincts of the parent. The user's anger stems from wanting to protect their child, which is a natural reaction. The harsh words were a result of that protective instinct. So in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not entirely. The husband and mother initiated the harmful comments, which is a more significant issue. The user's response, while not the most tactful, was a reaction to protect their daughter. So the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
