We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong (AITA). Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user's daughter is 26, moved back in after a tough breakup, had clinical depression, and has been making progress. She's working, in school, and in therapy. But she's a bit messy, which the husband is upset about. The mother and daughter have a normal relationship with minor issues. The problem arises when the husband and mother criticize the daughter in front of her, specifically about her messiness and not taking care of the cat properly. The daughter is emotionally hurt, starts sobbing, and the husband doesn't apologize. The user steps in, yells at both her mother and husband, telling them to be respectful or \"fuck off,\" then takes the daughter out. Now, the mother and husband are not speaking to her, and she's feeling bad but also concerned about her daughter's mental health.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the user's response was appropriate. The key here is the context. The daughter is struggling with her mental health, and the parents are criticizing her in a public setting. The user's outburst happened after her daughter was emotionally injured and not supported by her father. The user's intention was to protect her daughter's mental health. However, the method used was yelling and using strong language, which could be seen as excessive.\n\nBut then, considering the circumstances: the daughter was already in a vulnerable state, and the parents' criticism was triggering her self-esteem issues. The user's actions were a reaction to protect her daughter from further harm. The husband's not apologizing and the mother's continued criticism might have contributed to the user's frustration.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. On one hand, yelling and using harsh language isn't ideal. On the other hand, the user's intent was protective. The question is whether the response was justified given the emotional context. Some might argue that the user had a right to defend her daughter, especially since the criticism was happening in front of her and causing emotional distress. Others might say that the user should have handled it more calmly to avoid further conflict.\n\nAdditionally, the daughter's mental health history is a significant factor. The user is prioritizing her daughter's well-being, which is a strong point in her favor. The mother and husband's actions could potentially set the daughter back, so the user's intervention was aimed at preventing that.\n\nHowever, the user did use offensive language, which might be seen as crossing a line, even if the intent was good. But considering the emotional state of the daughter and the lack of support from the husband and mother, the user's reaction could be seen as a necessary, if impulsive, response to protect her daughter.\n\nSo, weighing all factors: the user's actions were a reaction to protect her daughter from emotional harm caused by others. The response was intense, but the context of the daughter's mental health and the public humiliation might justify it. Therefore, the user might not be in the wrong. But the use of harsh language could be a point against her. However, in AITA questions, the focus is often on intentions and justification. Given the circumstances, the user's actions were protective, so she might not be at fault.\n"
