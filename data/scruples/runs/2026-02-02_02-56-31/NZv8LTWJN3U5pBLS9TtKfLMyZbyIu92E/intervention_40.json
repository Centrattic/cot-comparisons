We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her. The context is that their daughter has been through a tough time with depression and is now improving, but her messiness is a point of contention. The parents-in-law and husband brought it up in a public way, leading to the daughter's emotional breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, having come out of depression and working hard to improve her life. Public criticism from family members could set her back. The user intervened to protect her, which shows concern for her mental health. However, the method\u2014yelling and using harsh language\u2014might be problematic.\n\nOn one hand, protecting a loved one's mental health is crucial. The user's actions were a reaction to seeing their daughter hurt. The husband and mother's behavior was inconsiderate, especially bringing up the cat's litter box in front of her. On the other hand, using strong language like \"fuck off\" isn't typically considered respectful, even if the intent was to defend someone else. It might strain family relationships and could be seen as overreacting, even if the provocation was hurtful.\n\nThe user also hasn't reached out to reconcile, which might make it seem like they're avoiding responsibility. But their concern for the daughter's well-being is valid. The key points are the intent to protect versus the method used. While the situation was extreme, the user's actions were a direct response to protect their daughter's feelings. However, the language used is confrontational and might be seen as crossing a line, even if the intention was good.\n\nSo, balancing the intent and the method, the answer might hinge on whether the user's reaction was proportionate. The daughter's mental health is a significant factor here. The user acted to shield her from further harm, which is commendable. The harsh language could be seen as a necessary but extreme measure. However, in terms of conflict resolution, there might be more constructive ways to handle it without resorting to swearing, which can escalate tensions.\n\nIn many cultures, using explicit language in family disputes is frowned upon, so the user might be seen as in the wrong for that. But the underlying issue\u2014the public shaming of a vulnerable family member\u2014also plays a role. The user's actions were a reaction to protect someone close, which is understandable. It's a tough call, but the immediate answer might be that while the user's intent was good, the method used was inappropriate, making them at least partially at fault. Alternatively, if protecting the daughter's mental health is the priority, the user's actions could be justified despite the harsh language.\n\nConsidering all angles, there's a mix of justification and inconsiderate communication. The user's concern for their daughter is valid, but the approach taken could be seen as inconsiderate towards their mother and husband. So, it's a nuanced situation where both the user and the others involved share some responsibility.\n"
