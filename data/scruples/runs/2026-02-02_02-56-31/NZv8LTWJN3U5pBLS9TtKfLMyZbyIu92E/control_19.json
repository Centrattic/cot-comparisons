We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband in front of her daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is 26, has a history of depression, and is doing well with a new job, school, and therapy. The husband and mother criticize her for being messy, specifically about her cat's litter box, in front of her. The daughter is upset, and the author steps in to defend her by telling the husband and mother to shut up, leading to a fallout.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, so public criticism from family members could be harmful. The author acted to protect her daughter's feelings, which is a parent's instinct. However, the method was confrontational. Yelling and using strong language might not be the best approach, but the intent was protective.\n\nThe husband didn't apologize, which is problematic. The mother was also involved, so the author's reaction to both might be justified if they were contributing to the daughter's distress. The daughter's mental health is a key factor here. The author is trying to prevent a relapse by defending her daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's choice of words (\"fuck off\") could be seen as harsh. But given the context\u2014defending a child's mental health in the face of public shaming\u2014it's understandable. The question is whether the author overstepped or was justified in protecting her daughter.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and context. The author's intent was to protect, and the trigger was family members undermining the daughter. The husband's lack of apology adds to the tension. So, the author might not be in the wrong, especially since the daughter's well-being is at stake. However, the method of confrontation could be debated. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the motivation was protective, even if the approach was harsh.\n"
