We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the daughter is trying to recover from depression and has been making progress, like getting a job, going to school, and therapy. The husband and the mother are criticizing her for being messy and not taking care of the cat in front of her. The daughter ends up crying and feeling really bad about herself.\n\nThe author, who is presumably the mom, steps in and yells at her husband and mother to stop or else they can have dinner alone. Then she takes her daughter out to calm down. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable position, recovering from depression. Public criticism from family members can really set her back. The mother is trying to protect her daughter's mental health by defending her. The husband and mother-in-law are not being supportive, instead, they're adding to the daughter's stress by criticizing her in front of her. \n\nThe mother's reaction was to lose her temper and tell them to fuck off. That's a strong response, but considering the emotional state of her daughter and the fact that the husband didn't apologize, maybe it was justified. The mother's actions were to prevent further harm to her daughter's mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, using harsh language might have been unwise, but the alternative was letting the daughter continue to be criticized. The mother's main goal was to protect her child, which is a valid concern. The husband and mother-in-law's behavior was inappropriate, so the mother's response, while strong, was in defense of her daughter.\n\nI think the key here is that the mother was trying to protect her daughter's well-being. The criticism from the father and mother-in-law was harmful and could have negative consequences. So, while the language used was harsh, the mother's intent was protective, making her not in the wrong.\n"
