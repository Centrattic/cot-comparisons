We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband in front of their daughter after they criticized her. The daughter was dealing with depression, had made a lot of progress, but was being called out for being messy. The parents were being unsupportive in front of her, which led to her crying and feeling bad about herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter was in a fragile state, working on recovery. Public criticism can be really damaging, especially when someone is vulnerable. The user's husband and mother didn't apologize and continued to berate her, which probably made the situation worse. The user stepped in to protect their daughter, which is a natural response when a family member is being harmed emotionally.\n\nNow, the user's response was to yell and tell them to \"fuck off.\" That's a strong reaction, but given the circumstances, was it justified? The question is whether the user overstepped or acted appropriately to defend their daughter. They took their daughter out to calm her down, which shows they were trying to mitigate the harm.\n\nOn one hand, using strong language is not ideal, and maybe there's a lesson in handling things calmly. On the other hand, the situation was emotionally charged, and the parents were being unsupportive. The user's actions were to protect their child's mental health, which is a high priority.\n\nIt's also important to note that the husband didn't apologize, which might have contributed to the user's frustration. The user felt they had to take a stand to prevent further harm. So while the method was harsh, the intent was protective. In such cases, people often prioritize the immediate well-being of a loved one over maintaining calm in a conflict.\n\nConsidering all this, the user's actions were driven by a desire to protect their daughter. They might have handled it differently, but they're not necessarily in the wrong. The answer is likely B.\n"
