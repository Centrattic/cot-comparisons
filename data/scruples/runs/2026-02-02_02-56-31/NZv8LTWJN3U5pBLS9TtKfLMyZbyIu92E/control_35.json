We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves the author's daughter who's recovering from depression, and her parents and mother-in-law are criticizing her in front of her. The daughter is doing a lot of positive things despite her past, like getting a job, going back to school, and seeing a therapist. The husband and mother-in-law are making her feel bad about her messiness and her cat, which the author has been taking care of.\n\nThe key points here are that the daughter is in a vulnerable state, having recently come out of a bad relationship and depression. Public criticism from family members could really hurt her mental health. The author intervened when they saw their daughter breaking down and being berated. The author's reaction was to tell the husband and mother to stop or leave, which is pretty strong language but in defense of their daughter.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, yelling and using harsh language is not the best approach, but on the other hand, the author was protecting their daughter from emotional harm. The daughter's mental health is a priority here. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism, which might have escalated the situation. \n\nThe author's actions were a response to a situation where their daughter's well-being was at risk. While the method might have been aggressive, the intent was protective. So, considering the context, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because they were defending their daughter's mental health against family members who were being unkind. However, it's possible that some might argue that the author overreacted. But given the daughter's fragile state, the author's reaction seems justified.\n"
