We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband when they criticized their daughter in front of her. The daughter was already dealing with depression and had made a lot of progress. The parents' comments about her messiness and the cat were hurtful, and the user felt they had to defend their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter was coming off a period of depression and was working hard to improve her life. The mother and husband's criticism, especially in front of her, could be damaging. The user's reaction was to stand up for their daughter, which is a protective instinct. Yelling was the method used, which is strong, but maybe understandable given the emotional state of the daughter and the user's frustration.\n\nThe user's husband didn't apologize, and the mother didn't stop. That might justify the user's outburst. However, using such harsh language (\"fuck off\") might be seen as inappropriate. But the user's intention was to protect their daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern. The question is whether the means justified the ends.\n\nOn the other hand, the user could have handled it differently, like addressing the issue privately with their husband and mother instead of in front of the daughter. But the situation was already public, and the daughter was emotionally harmed. The user's actions prevented further harm, which is a positive. The aftermath is that the user is feeling bad, and the family is now estranged. The user might need to consider apologizing later for the outburst while also explaining the reasoning.\n\nSo, balancing the intent to protect against the method used. The core issue is the criticism of the daughter in her presence. The user acted to defend her, which is noble, but the choice of words might be problematic. However, given the daughter's mental health, the user's actions are more about protection than aggression. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong. But it's a tough call because the language used was harsh. However, in the context of protecting a vulnerable family member, it might be justified.\n"
