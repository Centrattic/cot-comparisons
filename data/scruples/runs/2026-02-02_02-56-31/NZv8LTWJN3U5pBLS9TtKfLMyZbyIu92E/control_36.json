We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter who's recovering from depression, her parents, and the mother-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The daughter moved back in with her parents after a tough breakup and a depression diagnosis. She's made progress\u2014getting a job, going to school, therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which the writer (the mother) thinks is due to her past depression. The mother-in-law visits, and both the husband and mother criticize the daughter in front of her about her messiness and the cat's litter box. The daughter is upset, and the mother snaps at them, telling them to \"fuck off\" or leave. Now, the family isn't talking, and the writer is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the daughter's mental health, public shaming by family members, and the mother's outburst. The question is whether the mother overreacted or was justified in protecting her daughter.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, public criticism can be damaging, especially to someone in recovery. The daughter was doing well but then faced criticism from people she might respect (parents and mother-in-law), which could trigger a setback. The mother stepped in to defend her, which is a protective response. However, the method was aggressive (\"fuck off\"), which might be seen as harsh, but the intent was to protect her daughter's mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother-in-law might have thought they were being honest or concerned about the daughter's habits. But doing it in front of her and without compassion could be harmful. The daughter internalized it, thinking she's a \"piece of shit,\" which is exactly what she shouldn't hear when recovering.\n\nThe mother's outburst was a reaction to seeing her child being emotionally attacked. While the language was strong, the underlying motivation was protective. In such cases, the immediate priority is the well-being of the daughter. The mother might have handled it differently (like a private talk), but in the heat of the moment, her reaction was to stop the bullying.\n\nConsidering all factors, the mother's action was a response to protect her daughter's mental health, which is critical. The husband and mother-in-law's public criticism was inappropriate, especially given the daughter's history. Therefore, the mother isn't in the wrong for defending her child in that situation.\n"
