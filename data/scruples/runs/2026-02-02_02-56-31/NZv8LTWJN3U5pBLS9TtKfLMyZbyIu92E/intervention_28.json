We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband in front of their daughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter has been through a tough time, has depression, and is now doing better. She's working and studying, which is a big achievement. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which led the daughter to feel terrible. The user stepped in, yelled at the two of them, and then took the daughter out to calm her down.\n\nThe user's main concern is whether their reaction was wrong. They feel bad about losing their temper but also want to protect their daughter's mental health.\n\nFrom the story, the husband and mother were being critical in front of the daughter, which is not good, especially considering her mental health history. The user intervened to stop the harassment and protect their daughter. While yelling might not be the best approach, the intention was to defend their daughter's dignity.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the context. The user's anger was a reaction to protecting a vulnerable family member from public criticism that could harm her progress. The husband and mother's behavior was problematic, leading to the daughter's emotional breakdown. The user's reaction, while harsh, was a defense mechanism to shield their daughter.\n\nHowever, the user didn't apologize afterward, which might have been necessary to mend relationships. But the question is about being in the wrong for the initial outburst. Considering the circumstances, the user's action was a response to protect their child's well-being. So, in this context, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), because the user's intent was protective, even if the method could have been better.\n"
