We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, the context: The daughter has a history of depression and is making progress. The parents are trying to support her. The daughter's slobbishness is a point of contention, but the user is more forgiving because she's under a lot of stress. \n\nThe problem arises when the husband and mother discuss the daughter's habits in front of her. The husband vents to the mother, and they both criticize the daughter, especially about her cat. The daughter gets upset, and they don't apologize. The user then snaps and tells them to be respectful or else. \n\nNow, to evaluate if the user is in the wrong. The key points are the public criticism of someone with a mental health condition, the lack of apology from the husband and mother, and the user's reaction. \n\nPublic shaming, especially for someone in recovery, can be harmful. The user's reaction, while harsh, might be seen as a defense of their daughter's mental health. However, using such strong language could be considered disrespectful. \n\nBut the mother and husband also made a mistake by discussing the daughter's behavior in front of her and not apologizing. The user's outburst was in response to that, which might be justified given the daughter's vulnerability. \n\nSo, is the user at fault? They did lose their temper, but the context is important. The parents' actions were harmful, and the user's reaction was to protect their daughter. However, the method of confrontation might not be the healthiest. \n\nOn the other hand, the user's approach might not be the best way to handle it, but given the circumstances, it could be seen as a necessary stand to protect the daughter. They might not be in the wrong, but their method could be questioned. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they were protecting their daughter from harmful criticism. However, some might argue that the language used was inappropriate regardless of the situation.\n"
