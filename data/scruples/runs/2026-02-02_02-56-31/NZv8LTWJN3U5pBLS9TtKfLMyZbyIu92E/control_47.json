We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's a mother and wife, had a blowout with her mom and husband because they criticized her daughter in front of her. The daughter was already dealing with depression and had made a lot of progress, but the parents were commenting on her messiness and the cat's care. The author lost her temper and told them to fuck off, then took her daughter out to calm down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter has a history of depression and is trying to recover. Public criticism from family members, especially parents, can be really damaging. The author stood up for her daughter, which is a protective instinct. But did she go too far by yelling and using harsh language?\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother were venting in front of the daughter, which is unkind. The husband didn't apologize when his daughter was upset, which isn't helpful. The mother joined in, which added to the problem. The author's reaction was a result of frustration and wanting to protect her daughter's mental health. However, using such strong language might have been an overreaction, even if the situation was wrong.\n\nBut then again, considering the daughter's mental state, the author's actions were driven by a desire to shield her from further harm. The key points are the intent behind the actions and the consequences. The author's intent was protective, whereas the mother and husband's comments were hurtful. The author might have handled it differently, like addressing it calmly, but the emotional response was due to concern for her daughter.\n\nSo, balancing all that, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The husband and mother were in the wrong for how they spoke to the daughter, and the author's reaction, while harsh, was a response to protect her. However, the language used was inappropriate. But in the context of a heated emotional moment, it's a common reaction. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that the mother and husband were also at fault, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But if we focus solely on the author's actions without context, maybe A. But the context here is crucial. The daughter's mental health is a big factor. The author's reaction was a result of protecting her daughter from further emotional harm. So, B might be the better answer.\n"
