We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nThe situation is that the author's daughter, who's 26 and has been through a lot (depression, moving back in, starting a job and school), is being criticized by her dad and the author's mother about her messiness and cat care. The parents are talking in front of the daughter, which is probably really hurtful. The daughter gets upset, calls herself a piece of shit, and the husband doesn't apologize. Then the author snaps and tells them to fuck off and leaves the dinner, taking the daughter to get food.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong for yelling and telling them to fuck off?\n\nFirst, let's consider the daughter's mental health. She's in a vulnerable state, dealing with depression. Public criticism from family members, especially when they're not in a good headspace, could really set her back. The author is trying to protect her daughter from further harm, which is a valid concern. The parents' comments were in front of the daughter, which is a big no-no. They should have known better, especially since the husband knows the daughter's situation.\n\nThe husband and mother-in-law's behavior is questionable. They're berating the daughter about things that might be manageable but are being blown out of proportion. The fact that the husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset is also a problem. That's not supportive.\n\nThe author intervened when the daughter was clearly in emotional distress. The husband and mother were continuing their criticism even after the daughter was crying. That's pretty harsh. The author's outburst happened after multiple attempts to console the daughter and seeing her in such a state. Losing their temper was a reaction to protect the daughter from further emotional harm.\n\nHowever, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might not be the best approach. It's understandable in the moment, but it's probably not constructive. The author could have handled it differently, maybe by confronting the husband and mother in a calmer way later. But given the emotional state of the daughter and the ongoing criticism, the author's immediate reaction might be seen as necessary to stop the harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the author also hasn't reached out since, so maybe they need to consider reconciliation. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the aftermath.\n\nSo, the key points are: protecting a vulnerable daughter from public criticism by family, the criticism being unkind and inconsiderate of her situation, and the author's outburst being a response to that. The author's actions were a defense of their daughter's mental health and emotional well-being. The husband and mother-in-law's actions were the initial problem.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong because they took a stand to protect their daughter from harmful criticism. The fault lies more with the husband and mother for their behavior. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
