We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is at fault in this situation. The scenario involves a daughter who's recovering from depression, a husband and mother who criticized her in front of her, leading the author to yell at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a lot going on\u2014new job, school, therapy. The author is supportive, cutting her daughter some slack about the messiness. The husband and mother, however, publicly criticized the daughter, which led to her crying and feeling bad about herself. The author intervened by telling them to stop or leave, which caused a fallout but protected the daughter's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are the mental health aspect and public humiliation. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, and public criticism from family members could trigger a relapse. The author acted to protect her daughter's emotional well-being. While yelling isn't ideal, the motivation was to defend the daughter. However, the method might be questioned\u2014maybe a calmer approach could have been better, but given the emotional situation, losing temper might be understandable.\n\nThe husband not apologizing and continuing the criticism adds to the severity. The mother's involvement in berating the daughter also plays a role. The author's response was a reaction to protect their daughter from further harm, which is a valid concern. So, considering the intent and the context, the author might not be in the wrong. But there's a balance between protecting a family member and maintaining relationships with others. However, the immediate harm caused by the criticism is significant here. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) since the action was to protect a vulnerable family member.\n"
