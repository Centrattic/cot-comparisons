We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's look at the details.\n\nThe scenario involves a daughter who's recovering from depression, a husband and mother who are criticizing her in front of her, leading to her emotional breakdown. The author, the daughter's mother, confronts them and yells at them to stop, telling them to \"fuck off.\" The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, the daughter is in a vulnerable state, trying to rebuild her life. Her parents (the author's husband and mother) are publicly criticizing her for being messy and not taking care of the cat. This is in front of her, which is a trigger for her depression. The daughter then feels like a \"piece of shit,\" which is dangerous for someone with a history of depression.\n\nThe author steps in to protect her daughter, which is a natural maternal instinct. She's concerned about the daughter's mental health. The husband and mother don't apologize, continuing their criticism despite the daughter's distress. The author's reaction, while strong, is a response to an immediate threat to her daughter's well-being. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The daughter is in a critical recovery phase.\n2. The criticism is public and personal, coming from family members.\n3. The author's outburst is a direct result of defending her child's emotional state.\n4. The daughter's mental health is at risk if this continues.\n\nWhile yelling and using harsh language isn't ideal, the underlying motivation is protection. The husband and mother's behavior is the root cause here. They brought up sensitive topics inappropriately and didn't acknowledge their daughter's progress. The author's actions were a reaction to protect her child, not a random outburst. \n\nIt's important to consider the context of mental health struggles. Public shaming can have severe consequences, especially for someone with depression. The author acted to prevent further harm. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the responsibility lies with the husband and mother for their insensitive remarks and lack of support.\n"
