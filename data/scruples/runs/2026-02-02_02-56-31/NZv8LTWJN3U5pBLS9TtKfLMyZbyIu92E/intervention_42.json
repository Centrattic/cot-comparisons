We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband in front of their daughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been through a tough time with depression and has made significant progress. The daughter is now working and going to school, which is a big deal. The main issue is that she's a bit messy, which is understandable given her past struggles. The husband and mother talked about this in front of her, which was hurtful. They even criticized her for not taking care of the cat, something the user has been handling. \n\nThe daughter got emotionally upset, crying and feeling like everyone thinks she's a \"piece of shit.\" The user stepped in to console her, but the husband didn't apologize and the mother kept going. That's when the user lost their temper and told them to either be respectful or \"fuck off.\" \n\nNow, the user is feeling bad but also protecting their daughter. The key points here are the intent to protect a vulnerable daughter, the public shaming by the husband and mother, and the emotional impact on the daughter. The user's outburst was a reaction to protect their child's self-esteem and mental health. \n\nOn the other hand, yelling and using harsh language isn't the best approach. However, the context is that they were defending their daughter from unfair criticism, especially when the daughter is already struggling with mental health. The husband and mother's actions were inconsiderate, talking about the daughter's messiness in front of her, which is a breach of respect. \n\nSo, while the user's method might not have been ideal, their motivation was to protect their daughter. The husband and mother also have some responsibility here for not being considerate. The user's actions were a reaction to a harmful situation. Therefore, it's more about the circumstances than just the action itself. \n\nI think the answer is B (I am not in the wrong) because the user was defending their daughter from harmful criticism, especially considering the daughter's mental health history. The husband and mother's behavior was the root issue here.\n"
