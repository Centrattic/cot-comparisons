We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation involves a daughter who's recovering from depression, and her parents and mother-in-law are criticizing her for being messy and not taking care of the cat. The user lost their temper and told her mother and husband to \"fuck off\" in front of their daughter. \n\nFirst, the daughter's progress is significant. She's back in school, working, and in therapy. The messiness is a recent issue, possibly linked to her depression. The husband and mother-in-law brought this up in front of her, which was hurtful. The daughter was upset and feeling like a \"piece of shit,\" which is really serious because it affects her mental health.\n\nThe user's reaction was to defend their daughter. They took her out to calm down and then didn't reach out to the others. The key points here are intent and proportionality. The user's intent was protective\u2014trying to shield the daughter from further emotional harm. The criticism from the husband and mother-in-law was happening in a public setting, which is more hurtful. \n\nThe user's outburst was direct and harsh, but it was in response to their daughter's emotional state. The question is whether the response was appropriate. While swearing might not be the best approach, the underlying motivation was to protect a vulnerable family member. The husband not apologizing and the mother continuing the criticism without remorse could justify the user's frustration. \n\nHowever, the user could have handled it differently, like addressing the issue calmly after the meeting. But given the immediate emotional impact on the daughter, the user's reaction might be seen as a necessary, if extreme, measure to support their child. The user's actions prioritized the daughter's well-being over maintaining a good relationship with the in-laws in that moment. \n\nConsidering all this, the user might not be in the wrong because their primary concern was their daughter's mental health, and they reacted to a harmful situation. The husband and mother-in-law's behavior was inappropriate for discussing such issues in front of the daughter. So, the answer is B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
