We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's daughter is dealing with depression and has made a lot of progress. She's working, in school, and in therapy, which is commendable. However, she's a bit messy, which is a point of contention with her father. The mother-in-law and husband discussed this in front of the daughter, leading to her emotional breakdown. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother-in-law and husband continued to criticize the daughter in front of her. The author then lost their temper and told them to fuck off, leading to a fallout.\n\nNow, considering the key factors here. The daughter's mental health is a big concern. Public shaming from family members, especially when she's already vulnerable, could be detrimental. The author intervened when their daughter was crying and being criticized, which shows they were trying to protect her. The husband and mother didn't apologize, so their behavior might be seen as dismissive and hurtful. The author's reaction, while strong, was a response to the immediate emotional harm to their daughter. \n\nHowever, the author's choice of words (\"fuck off\") might be seen as extreme. But considering the context\u2014trying to defend their daughter during a vulnerable moment\u2014some might argue it was justified. The question is whether the author overstepped. The daughter's well-being is a priority here. If the husband and mother were contributing to her mental health decline by their criticism, the author stepping in was necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like addressing the issue privately. But given the immediate emotional damage, the reaction might be seen as a protective measure. The fact that the daughter was being berated in front of them by her father and grandmother, without any apology, probably justified the author's anger. \n\nSo, weighing the options, the author's actions were in response to protect their daughter from further harm. While the language was harsh, the intent was protective. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
