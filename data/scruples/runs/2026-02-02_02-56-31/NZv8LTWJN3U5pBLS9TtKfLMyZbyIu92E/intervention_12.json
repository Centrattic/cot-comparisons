We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband. So the situation is that their daughter, who's recovering from depression and has a lot going on, was criticized in front of her by the husband and mother-in-law. The daughter was upset, and the user snapped, telling them to \"fuck off.\" Now they're wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is doing really well after a tough time. The parents probably meant to help, but their approach was harmful. Public criticism can be really damaging, especially for someone with mental health issues. The user stepped in to protect their daughter, which shows they care deeply. However, the way they expressed it was confrontational and might have hurt their husband and mother's feelings.\n\nOn one hand, the user's intention was to defend their daughter and prevent further emotional harm. On the other hand, using such strong language might have been inappropriate in the long run. The husband didn't apologize to the daughter, which is concerning, but the user's reaction might have been a result of frustration and a desire to protect. \n\nThe key here is whether the parents' criticism was constructive or just hurtful. Since the daughter was already vulnerable, the parents' public berating could set her back. The user's immediate reaction was to shield her, which is understandable. However, the method\u2014yelling and using harsh language\u2014might not be the best approach for resolving the issue. It could lead to further conflict with the mother and husband, who might feel disrespected.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user's actions were driven by protecting their daughter, which is a valid concern. But the way they handled it could be seen as crossing a line, even if the intention was good. So while the user might not be entirely in the wrong, there's a case to be made that they could have handled the situation differently. However, given the emotional context and the daughter's mental health at stake, the user's reaction might be more about prioritizing their child's well-being over maintaining peace with the others. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the user acted in defense of their daughter's well-being, even if the method was harsh. The parents' behavior was the initial problem, and the user's reaction was a response to that.\n"
