We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) based on the situation they described. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the user is a parent to a 26-year-old daughter recovering from depression. The daughter has made significant progress, including getting a job, going to school, and therapy. However, there's some messiness in her living habits, which is causing tension with the husband and mother-in-law. The issue escalated when the mother and husband, in front of the daughter, criticized her for the mess and the cat's care. The daughter was upset, and the user lost their temper, telling the two to either respect their daughter or \"fuck off.\" Now, there's a rift, and they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main factors here are the daughter's mental health progress, the inconsiderate comments from family members, and the user's reaction. The user intervened to protect their daughter's feelings, which is understandable. The husband and mother-in-law were criticizing the daughter in her presence, which is unkind and could harm her mental health. The user's outburst was a reaction to protect their child, who was already vulnerable. \n\nBut on the other hand, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as unprofessional or disrespectful, even if the intent was good. However, the context is that the daughter was being berated in front of others, leading to emotional distress. The user's action might be justified as a defense of their child's dignity. \n\nThe husband not apologizing after the daughter was hurt adds to the problem. The mother and father-in-law continued the criticism even after the daughter was clearly upset. The user's reaction was a response to protect their daughter from further harm. \n\nConsidering all this, the user's actions, while possibly harsh in language, were driven by protecting their child's mental health. The family members were in the wrong for the initial criticism. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
