We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is at fault (AITA) for yelling at her mother and husband when they criticized her daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has been through a lot\u2014recently out of a bad relationship, depression, and now she's making progress in her job and school. Her parents and mother-in-law publicly criticized her for being messy, even bringing up her cat's litter box. The daughter was clearly upset, crying, and feeling bad about herself. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism. \n\nThe author stepped in to defend her daughter, which shows she prioritized her daughter's well-being. The daughter's mental health is crucial here, especially since she's in a vulnerable state. The in-laws' public criticism could have a negative impact on her recovery. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter from emotional harm. \n\nHowever, yelling and using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as aggressive. But given the circumstances, it's a response to a stressful situation where the daughter's self-esteem was at risk. The author is concerned about her daughter regressing mentally if this continues. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother's behavior was inconsiderate, talking about the daughter's shortcomings in her presence without empathy. The husband didn't apologize, which is a problem. The mother didn't check the context of the daughter's situation. \n\nThe key here is intent versus action. The author's intent was to protect her daughter, which is a valid reason. The method was confrontational, but maybe justified given the emotional stakes. The in-laws' actions were the root cause, but the author's response is what's being questioned. \n\nIn AITA situations, it's about whether the person's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The author acted to protect her daughter from public shaming, which can be damaging for someone with depression. The author's anger stems from concern for her daughter's mental health. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions, though harsh, were driven by a desire to protect her daughter. Therefore, she might not be at fault. But there's a nuance. Maybe she could have handled it differently, but the intent was protective. The in-laws' behavior was the initial wrongdoing. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she acted to defend her daughter from harmful criticism, especially considering the daughter's mental health history. The in-laws' behavior was inappropriate, and the author's reaction, though strong, was in response to protect her child.\n"
