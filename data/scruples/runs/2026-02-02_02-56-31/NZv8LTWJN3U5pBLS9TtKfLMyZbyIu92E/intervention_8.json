We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their mother and husband to fuck off after they criticized their daughter in front of her. The situation involves their daughter, who's recovering from depression and has a lot going on, and the parents and mother-in-law berating her for being messy and not taking care of the cat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has been through a lot and is making progress. It's important to support someone in recovery, so public criticism might not be helpful. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which could be really hurtful. The daughter's response of feeling like a \"piece of shit\" shows how much it affected her.\n\nThe user's reaction was to yell at the husband and mother-in-law, telling them to fuck off or be respectful. They took their daughter to calm down. The user hasn't reached out since, but feels bad for losing their temper. However, they were protecting their daughter's mental health.\n\nNow, the question is whether they were in the wrong. On one hand, using strong language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as harsh, but the context is a stressful situation where their daughter's well-being was at stake. The husband and mother-in-law were being unkind and not considering the daughter's recent struggles. The user's actions were a defense of their daughter.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user's intent was to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. However, the method might have been aggressive. But given the emotional impact on the daughter and the need to stop the criticism, maybe it's understandable. The alternative options (like calmly addressing it) might not have been effective if the couple continued berating her after the mother came back in.\n\nSo, the user's actions were a response to protect their daughter from harmful criticism. They might not be in the wrong, especially since supporting a family member's mental health is crucial. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong). However, maybe there's a case for A if one prioritizes the language used. But considering the context, B makes more sense.\n"
