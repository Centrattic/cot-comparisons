We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband in front of their daughter. The situation is that their daughter, who's recovering from depression, was criticized by her dad and grandmother about her messiness and cat care in front of her. The daughter was upset, and when the parents didn't apologize, the user lost it.\n\nHmm. So, the user's main concern is whether their reaction was justified. Let me break this down. The daughter has been through a hard time and is making progress. The parents' criticism might be undermining her recovery. The user stepped in to protect her, which is a natural response. \n\nBut, yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as harsh. However, the context is important here. The daughter was crying and feeling like a \"piece of shit,\" which is serious. The user's intervention was to stop the parents from further hurting her. \n\nOn one hand, the user is defending their child's well-being. On the other hand, their method might have been inappropriate. But considering the emotional state of the daughter and the fact that the parents didn't apologize, maybe the user's reaction is understandable. \n\nAlso, the daughter was being criticized about things that might not be her fault, given her recent progress. The parents might not realize the impact of their words on someone with depression. The user's action could be seen as protecting their child from further harm. \n\nSo, maybe the user isn't in the wrong because they prioritized their daughter's mental health. The parents' actions were hurtful, and the user's outburst was a reaction to protect. However, the method could be questioned, but the intent was good. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
