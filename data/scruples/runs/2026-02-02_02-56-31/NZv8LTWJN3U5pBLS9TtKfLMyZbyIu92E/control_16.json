We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation involves their daughter, their husband, their mother, and a conflict over the daughter's messiness.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 26, has a history of depression, and is doing well by getting a job, going back to school, and therapy. She's also taking care of a cat, which might be part of her recovery. The husband and mother criticize her in front of her, which is really hurtful. The daughter is emotionally vulnerable here, given her mental health history. \n\nThe author (the parent) steps in to defend their daughter, telling the husband and mother to \"fuck off\" and then takes the daughter to get food. The key points here are: the criticism happened in front of the daughter, the daughter was already upset, and the husband didn't apologize. The parent's reaction is a direct response to protect their daughter from further harm.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. On one hand, yelling and using harsh language might seem excessive, especially if they usually have a good relationship. But considering the context\u2014defending a vulnerable child from public criticism that's impacting their mental health\u2014this might be seen as a necessary action. The parent's priority was to protect their daughter's feelings, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe husband and mother's behavior also matters. If they were being unkind and dismissive, the parent's reaction could be justified. However, if the parent's outburst was disproportionate, maybe they are at fault. But given that the daughter was already crying and feeling like a \"piece of shit,\" the parent's intervention seems aimed at preventing further emotional damage. \n\nAlso, the parent had never spoken that way before, which might indicate that this was a rare, stress-induced reaction. The fact that they feel bad about it afterward shows some remorse. The main issue here is the public shaming of the daughter by the husband and mother, which the parent is correcting. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the husband and mother might be more at fault for not considering the daughter's mental health and the parent's reaction is a response to that. So the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, especially since they were protecting their daughter. The answer might be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
