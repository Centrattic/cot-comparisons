We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their mother and husband to fuck off after they criticized their daughter in front of her. The daughter has depression and was doing well until this incident.\n\nFirst, the husband and mother were talking about the daughter's messiness and her cat, which led to the daughter feeling bad about herself. The user stepped in to defend their daughter, which is understandable given the daughter's mental health history. The user's outburst was in response to their loved ones being unkind, which could have triggered the daughter's self-esteem issues.\n\nOn one hand, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" isn't typically respectful communication. Families often expect some level of civility. However, the context here is crucial. The daughter's mental health is at stake, and the parents' criticism could be detrimental. The user was trying to protect their daughter from further harm, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe husband not apologizing after his daughter was upset shows a lack of empathy, and the mother was supportive of the criticism. The user's actions, while confrontational, were in defense of their child. So, considering the intent to protect the daughter's mental health and the context of the family's usual dynamics, the user might not be in the wrong. However, the method of communication could be questioned. But given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the user acted to protect their daughter's well-being, even if the approach was harsh.\n"
