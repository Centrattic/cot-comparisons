We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter who's recovering from depression, and their mother and husband criticized her in front of them. The writer lost their temper and told their mother and husband to \"fuck off.\" The main question is whether the writer is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is doing well after a difficult period, but the parents are pointing out her messiness and the cat's care. The way they do it is in front of the daughter, which is a problem. Public criticism, especially when someone is vulnerable, can be really harmful. The daughter's reaction\u2014crying and feeling like a piece of shit\u2014shows that the comments hit hard and could affect her mental health negatively.\n\nThe writer's response was to yell and tell her mother and husband to either be respectful or leave. The question is if that response was wrong. The key factors here are the intent and the context. The writer's intent was to protect their daughter's feelings, which is a valid concern. However, the method they used\u2014yelling and using strong language\u2014might be seen as inappropriate. But given the emotional state of the daughter and the potential impact of the criticism, some might argue that the writer's reaction was justified as a necessary defense.\n\nThen there's the aftermath. The mother and husband aren't speaking to the writer. The writer hasn't reached out either but feels bad. The daughter is being consoled and taken away to calm down. The writer is conflicted but also concerned about the daughter's mental health. \n\nFrom a typical AITA perspective, the analysis would look at whose actions were more hurtful. The mother and husband's public criticism and lack of apology after the daughter was upset could be seen as the initial wrong. The writer's outburst was a reaction to protect their child, which might be understandable given the circumstances. However, the use of strong language and the abrupt separation could be seen as overreacting. But considering the daughter's mental health history, the writer might have felt it was necessary to intervene.\n\nIn many cases, AITA stories where someone stands up for a vulnerable family member are often seen as justified. The key is whether the response was proportionate. The writer didn't physically escalate the situation, just verbally confronted them. While the language was harsh, it was aimed at stopping further harm to the daughter. So the answer might lean towards B (no, the writer is not in the wrong) because they were protecting their daughter from emotional harm.\n"
