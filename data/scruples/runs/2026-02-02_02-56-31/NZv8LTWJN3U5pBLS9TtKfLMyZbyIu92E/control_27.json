We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves the author, their husband, mother, and daughter. The daughter is struggling with depression but has been making progress. The husband and mother criticize her for being messy in front of her, which upsets the daughter. The author loses their temper and tells them to \"fuck off,\" leading to a family rift.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, working hard to overcome depression. Public criticism from family members could negatively impact her mental health. The husband and mother were berating her in front of her, which seems harsh, especially considering her situation. The author intervened to protect their daughter, which shows concern for her well-being. \n\nThe key points here are the daughter's mental health, the public humiliation by family members, and the author's reaction. While the author's language was harsh, their intent was to defend their daughter. The husband's lack of apology and the mother's continued criticism suggest they didn't consider the daughter's emotional state. \n\nIn such cases, family dynamics and emotional support are crucial. The author's action, though confrontational, was a response to protect their child from harmful criticism. The question is whether the author overstepped. However, given the context of the daughter's vulnerability and the public shaming, the author's intervention might be justified. The main issue is the family's handling of the situation rather than the author's immediate reaction. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
