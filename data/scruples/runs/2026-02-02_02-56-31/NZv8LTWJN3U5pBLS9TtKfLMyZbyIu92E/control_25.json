We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author losing their temper and telling their mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they criticized their daughter in a hurtful way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter has been through a tough time with depression and has made significant progress. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which led to her emotional breakdown. The author intervened when they felt her mental health was at risk. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author's response was wrong. The author's actions were a direct reaction to protect their daughter. While the language used was harsh, the intent was to stop further harm. The husband and mother were being unkind, and the daughter was clearly distressed. The author's outburst might have been unprofessional or disrespectful, but the motivation was protective.\n\nOn the other hand, using such strong language might not be the best way to handle the situation. However, considering the emotional context and the daughter's vulnerability, the author might have felt there was no other way to stop the conversation. The key here is the intention versus the method. Even if the method was extreme, the underlying reason\u2014protecting a family member in a fragile state\u2014might justify it in some people's eyes.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we focus on the action of yelling and using offensive language, some might say yes. But if the focus is on defending their daughter's emotional well-being, others might say no. The story emphasizes the daughter's progress and the immediate threat to her mental health, which adds weight to the idea that the author's actions, while harsh, were a necessary reaction. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
