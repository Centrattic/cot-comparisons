We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter's messiness in front of her, which upset the daughter. The user's daughter was already dealing with depression and had made significant progress, but the criticism from her father and grandmother seemed to trigger her again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is a grown adult (26) who is working, going to school, and in therapy. Her messiness might be a minor issue compared to her achievements. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which is a big no-no, especially when she has a history of depression. Public criticism from family can be really damaging, especially if it's not constructive.\n\nThe user intervened when they saw their daughter being hurt. They told the husband and mother to either be respectful or \"fuck off.\" While the language is strong, the intent was to protect their daughter's mental health. The user is now feeling conflicted because their family isn't speaking to them, but they're also concerned about their daughter's well-being.\n\nI should consider whether the user overreacted. Yelling is a strong reaction, but given the context\u2014protecting a vulnerable daughter from public shaming\u2014it might be justified. The key here is the intent. The user acted out of love and concern, not just anger. However, the harsh language could have been hurtful to the husband and mother, even if the user's intention was good.\n\nThe husband's part in initiating the criticism in front of the daughter is problematic. He should have been more considerate, especially knowing the daughter's history. The mother agreeing and adding to the criticism didn't help. The user stepped in when the emotional harm was already done, which shows they were trying to protect their daughter.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the husband and mother might be more at fault for their initial actions, but the user's response is also under scrutiny. The question is whether the user's method of protecting their daughter was appropriate. While the language was harsh, the core issue is about standing up for a family member in distress. The user's actions were driven by a desire to prevent further harm, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the user was justified in their reaction given the circumstances. Since the daughter's mental health is at stake and the criticism was public and judgmental, the user's strong reaction might be seen as a necessary defense. Therefore, the user might not be in the wrong.\n"
