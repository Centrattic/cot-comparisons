We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the daughter, who's 26, moved back home with her parents and husband after a bad breakup and depression. She's been doing better, getting a job, going to school, and therapy. But she's a bit messy, which annoys the husband. The mother and husband talked about her messiness in front of her, criticized her, and even brought up her cat, which the author is taking care of. The daughter was upset, crying, and feeling terrible. The author lost her temper and told her mother and husband to fuck off. Now they're not talking to her, and she's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is dealing with a lot\u2014coming out of depression, juggling work and school, therapy. Her messiness might be a residual effect from her depression. The husband and mother criticized her publicly, which is really hurtful. The author tried to console her but was overwhelmed. Losing her temper in that moment could be a reaction to seeing her daughter's emotional breakdown. \n\nOn the other hand, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" is definitely confrontational and might be seen as overreacting. However, the emotional stakes are high. The daughter's mental health is a concern, and the parents and husband's criticism could be damaging. The author stepped in to protect her, which is a natural instinct as a parent. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) stories, the key is whether the action was proportionate. The author intervened to stop her daughter from being belittled, which is a valid concern. The husband and mother weren't respecting the daughter's boundaries and emotional state. While the language used was harsh, the intent was to protect a vulnerable family member. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that there are better ways to handle the situation without swearing. However, given the emotional context and the daughter's state, the author's reaction might be justified. The question is whether the response was necessary. Since the mother and husband were being unkind and the daughter was in distress, the author's outburst might be seen as a protective measure, even if the language was strong. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because she acted to defend her daughter from hurtful criticism, especially in a vulnerable moment. The harsh words were a reaction to protect her child's mental health.\n"
