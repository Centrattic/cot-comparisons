We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. So, the situation is about the daughter's messiness being criticized in front of her by the husband and mother, leading the author to lose their temper and tell them to fuck off. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter has been through a lot\u2014coming out of depression, getting a job, going to school, and therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, and the mother agrees. They criticize her in front of her, leading her to feel bad about herself. The author steps in to defend her daughter, which caused a rift with the husband and mother.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The daughter is making progress after depression, so her mental health is critical. Public criticism from family members could set her back. The author stepped in to protect her daughter, which is a parent's natural instinct. The husband not apologizing when the daughter was hurt is a red flag. The mother and husband's behavior seems unkind and inconsiderate. The author's reaction, while harsh, was in defense of their daughter's well-being.\n\nBut, the author did use a strong swear word and cut off communication. That could be seen as overreacting. However, given the context of the daughter's mental state and the public shaming, maybe it's justified. The husband and mother's actions were the root cause. The author's actions were a response to protect their daughter. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on who acted inconsiderately. Here, the husband and mother were the ones being inconsiderate first. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect their child. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they were defending their daughter's mental health and standing up against public criticism from family members.\n"
