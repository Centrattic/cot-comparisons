We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their husband and mother in front of their daughter. The situation involves the daughter's mental health and the parents criticizing her messiness and cat care in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter has depression and has made a lot of progress. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which upset her. The user defended their daughter by yelling at the two. Now, they're feeling conflicted because their family isn't speaking to them, but they're also worried about their daughter's mental health.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the user was wrong to lose their temper. On one hand, they stood up for their daughter, which is protective and supportive. On the other hand, yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" might have been inappropriate, even if the intention was good. \n\nI should consider the context: the daughter is vulnerable, and public criticism could set her back. The user's reaction was to shield her from further harm. However, the method used (yelling) might have caused additional stress to the family. But the user's actions were a reaction to protect their child's self-esteem, which is crucial for someone with depression. \n\nThe husband didn't apologize, which adds to the problem. The mother and husband's approach was inconsiderate, especially in front of the daughter. The user's outburst was a response to protect their child, even if it wasn't the most constructive way. \n\nAlternative actions might have been to address the issue privately later, but in the moment, the user acted to console their daughter. Considering the daughter's mental health is at stake, the user's actions might be seen as justified despite the harsh words. \n\nSo, the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the user prioritized their daughter's emotional well-being, and the criticism from family was inappropriate. However, they should consider better conflict resolution strategies in the future.\n"
