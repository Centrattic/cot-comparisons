We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mother and husband criticizing the daughter in front of her, leading the author to lose her temper and tell them off. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter is 26, has a history of depression, and has been making progress. The husband and mother are criticizing her for being messy and not taking care of the cat. They do this in front of her, which upsets her, leading her to feel bad about herself. The author steps in, yells at them, and takes the daughter away.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The daughter is in a vulnerable position, still recovering from depression. Public criticism from family members could potentially set her back. The author is trying to protect her daughter's mental health. The husband and mother were being disrespectful in front of the daughter, which is generally not healthy. The author's reaction is a result of frustration and a desire to protect her daughter from further harm.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, losing one's temper isn't ideal, but the context is important. The author's actions were in defense of their daughter's well-being. The mother and husband were in the wrong for their public criticism, so the author's response is a justified reaction to protect their child. However, the author did use strong language, which might be seen as harsh. But given the situation, it's clear they were trying to defend their daughter. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother need to take responsibility for their part in hurting the daughter. The author's actions, while intense, were a response to protect their daughter, who is still in recovery. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to support their daughter's mental health, even if the method was confrontational. The key here is the intent to protect versus the method used. Since the method was a reaction to protect the daughter from further harm, the author isn't at fault.\n"
