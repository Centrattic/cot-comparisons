We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, the daughter has a history of depression and has been making progress. The parents and mother-in-law publicly criticized her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, which upset the daughter. The user intervened to protect her daughter's feelings, which is understandable given the daughter's mental health history.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions behind the user's actions. They were trying to protect their daughter from emotional harm. While yelling and using strong language might not be the most constructive approach, the motivation was to defend their child's well-being. \n\nHowever, the user's approach could have been more effective. Instead of yelling, maybe addressing the issue calmly after the situation had cooled down could have been better. But given the emotional state of the daughter and the potential impact of the criticism, the user's reaction might be seen as justified in the moment. \n\nAlso, considering the daughter's progress, it's crucial that she feels supported. The user's decision to prioritize her emotional health over maintaining the peace with in-laws shows a protective instinct. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother's behavior seems dismissive and possibly harmful, given their awareness of the daughter's depression. Their public criticism could indeed set her back. The user acting to stop that might be seen as necessary, even if the method was harsh.\n\nSo, while the user's approach was not ideal, their intention was to protect their daughter's mental health. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong, but there's room for reflection on how to handle such situations better in the future.\n"
