We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA is in the wrong. The scenario is about a daughter-in-law's messiness being criticized in front of her by the husband and mother-in-law, leading to the daughter breaking down. The author (the mother) then yells at them and tells them to fuck off. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The daughter has come a long way from depression, which is a big deal. She's working, going to school, therapy\u2014all positive steps. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which is understandable, but bringing it up in front of her and criticizing her, especially about taking care of the cat, is a problem. The mother-in-law agreed with the husband, so it was a two-on-one situation, which could be really hurtful.\n\nThe daughter was crying and felt like a piece of shit. The husband didn't apologize, which is a red flag. The author intervened, which is understandable given the daughter's mental health. She took the daughter to calm down, but now the mother and husband are upset. The author feels bad but also right in protecting her daughter.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, yelling and using harsh language isn't ideal. On the other hand, the context is a vulnerable daughter's mental health. The parents' actions were harmful, and the author's reaction was a defense of her daughter. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intent and the context. If the daughter was at risk of relapsing due to this criticism, the mother's reaction might be seen as justified. The husband and mother's behavior was inappropriate, so the author standing up for her daughter could be seen as the right thing to do, even if the method was harsh. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because she protected her daughter's mental health from harmful criticism. But maybe some people would say A because of the language used. However, given the circumstances, the severity of the daughter's emotional breakdown and the parents' inconsiderate comments, it's more about defending her child. So B makes sense.\n"
