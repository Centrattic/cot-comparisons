We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the daughter is going through a lot, like depression, starting a new job, going back to school, and therapy. The parents and mother-in-law were criticizing her messiness in front of her, which made her cry and feel bad about herself. The author, who is the mother, lost her temper and told her mother and husband to fuck off. Now she's asking if she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable position. She's coming out of a bad relationship and dealing with depression. The parents and mother-in-law were berating her in front of others, which is pretty harsh, especially when she's trying to improve her life. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism. That's probably not helping the daughter's mental health at all.\n\nThe author stepped in to defend her daughter, which is a protective instinct. She was trying to stop the hurtful comments. Losing her temper and using strong language like \"fuck off\" might have been an overreaction, but the situation was emotionally charged. The key here is whether the criticism from the others was justified or not. The daughter has a lot on her plate, so being a slob might be a symptom of her depression, and the parents might not be considering that. Instead of supporting her, they're criticizing her, which could set her back.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's language was harsh. Telling people to \"fuck off\" is not the most constructive way to handle it. However, in the moment of high emotion, maybe she felt she had no other choice to protect her daughter. The question is about whether she was in the wrong. If the others were being unkind and the author was trying to stop them, then maybe she's not in the wrong. But if her response was disproportionate, then maybe she is.\n\nI think the main issue is that the parents and mother-in-law were being insensitive and unkind. The author's reaction, while strong, was in defense of her daughter's well-being. The daughter's mental health is a priority here. So, the author might not be in the wrong because she was protecting her child from further harm. The others started the problem by being critical, so the author's outburst was a result of that. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
