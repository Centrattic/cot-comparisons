We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves their daughter who's recovering from depression. The mother and husband criticized her in front of her, which led to the daughter breaking down. The person snapped at their mother and husband, telling them to fuck off. Now they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, the daughter is doing well after her depression, which is a big plus. But the husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which is really hurtful. Public criticism can be damaging, especially if someone is still recovering. The daughter's reaction\u2014crying and feeling like a piece of shit\u2014shows the impact was severe.\n\nThe person's response was to yell and tell them to fuck off. That's a strong reaction, but considering the emotional state of the daughter and the context, maybe it's understandable. They were trying to protect their daughter's feelings, which is a valid concern. However, the way they handled it was pretty harsh. Using such a strong insult might have been excessive, but the intention was to protect a family member.\n\nThe mother and husband didn't apologize, which might have escalated the situation. The person hasn't reached out either, so the communication is broken. The key points here are the intent behind the outburst and the circumstances. The person acted to defend their daughter, which is a protective instinct, but the method might not be the best approach. However, given the daughter's mental health history, the criticism from family could have serious repercussions. \n\nIs it the person's fault? Well, they had a valid reason to be upset. But using that kind of language might not be the best solution. However, sometimes people lose their temper when they see loved ones being hurt. The question is whether they are in the wrong. It depends on cultural context too. In some families, such language is more accepted in moments of high emotion. But in terms of right and wrong, the person's actions were a reaction to protect their daughter, which is understandable. So maybe they're not in the wrong. But they might need to apologize and resolve the conflict to mend relationships. The answer is likely B, No.\n"
