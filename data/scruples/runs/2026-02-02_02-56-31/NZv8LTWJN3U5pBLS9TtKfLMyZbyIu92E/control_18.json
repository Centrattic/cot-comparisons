We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's daughter, who's 26 and has been recovering from depression, is being criticized by her husband and mother in front of her. The daughter was already doing well, getting a job, going to school, therapy, etc., but then this incident happened. The parents are making her feel bad about her messiness and her cat, which leads the daughter to cry and feel like a piece of shit. The author then yells at them to stop and told them to fuck off, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was wrong to react that way. The key factors here are the context of the daughter's mental health, the public criticism from husband and mother, and the immediate emotional impact on the daughter. The author's main goal was to protect their daughter's mental health, which is crucial given her history of depression.\n\nThe husband and mother were publicly berating the daughter, which is generally considered hurtful and disrespectful. The author's reaction, while strong, was in defense of their daughter. However, using such a strong language (\"fuck off\") could be seen as crossing a line, even if the intent was good. But considering the context\u2014trying to protect a vulnerable family member from harmful criticism\u2014the reaction might be understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have handled it more calmly, maybe addressed the issue privately with the husband and mother first. But in the heat of the moment, when the daughter was already breaking down, the immediate need was to stop the emotional harm. The author's actions prevented further public shaming, which could have worsened the daughter's depression.\n\nThe question is whether the method (yelling and using strong language) was appropriate. While the language was harsh, the intent was protective. The daughter's mental health is a significant factor here. The author might feel that the harsh words were necessary to stop an immediate threat to their daughter's well-being.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to advise against using such language, but the situation is complex. The author's actions were driven by love and concern. The husband and mother's behavior was inconsiderate and potentially harmful. So, the author's reaction, while not ideal, might be justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
