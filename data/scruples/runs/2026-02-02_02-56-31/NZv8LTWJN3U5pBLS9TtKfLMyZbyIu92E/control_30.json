We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is at fault for yelling at their mother and husband in front of their daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter, who's 26, has recently overcome depression and is doing well in her job and school. However, she's still a bit messy, which her husband is annoyed about. The mother and husband talked about this in front of the daughter, even mentioning her cat's litter box, which she's not taking care of. The daughter was upset and felt hurt by their comments, leading the author to lose their temper and tell them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are the emotional impact on the daughter and the family dynamics. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was crying, which is a problem. The mother and husband continued to berate the daughter even after she was upset. The author intervened to protect their daughter's mental health, which is a significant factor.\n\nIs the author wrong for getting angry? Well, public shaming and criticism can be really damaging, especially when someone is vulnerable, like the daughter in this case. The husband and mother's actions might have been harmful, so the author's reaction was a form of defending their child. However, yelling and using harsh language can also be seen as inappropriate. But given the context\u2014trying to protect their daughter from emotional harm\u2014maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently without raising their voice. But the situation was escalating quickly, and the daughter was already in distress. The author's main concern was their daughter's well-being, which is a valid reason for intervention. The husband and mother's behavior was the root issue here. So while the method of confronting them was strong, the intent was protective.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were a response to a harmful situation. They might not be entirely at fault, especially since they were trying to protect their child. The husband and mother's actions were the main problem. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
