We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her. The daughter is struggling with depression and has made progress, but the parents' public criticism could set her back.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter moved in after a breakup and depression, has been improving, but the husband and mother criticized her messiness and cat care in front of her. This led to the daughter feeling awful, the user snapped, told them to be respectful or \"fuck off\", and hasn't reached out since. \n\nNow, the user is torn between feeling bad about their outburst and being protective of their daughter. The key points here are the daughter's mental health, the public shaming by husband and mother, and the user's reaction.\n\nOn one hand, publicly shaming someone, especially with a history of depression, is harmful. The user intervened to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, yelling and using such strong language (like \"fuck off\") might be seen as extreme, even if the intent was good.\n\nBut considering the context: the daughter's mental state, the criticism in front of her, and the user's history of a generally happy relationship with husband and a normal one with the mother, the user's reaction is understandable. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism, which likely escalated the situation. The user's action was to stop the negative dialogue, which could prevent the daughter's regression into depression.\n\nIn these cases, intentions matter. The user's intent was to protect their child, not to disrespect her parents. However, the method used might have been overly harsh. But given the emotional stakes and the daughter's vulnerability, it's a complex situation.\n\nI think the user is not in the wrong because they acted to protect their daughter from further harm. The criticism from family could indeed set her back, and the user's outburst was a reaction to protect her mental health. The right answer is B.\n"
