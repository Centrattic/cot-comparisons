We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they criticized their daughter in front of her. The daughter has been dealing with depression and is making progress, but her messiness and cat care became a point of criticism from the husband and mother. The user intervened when they felt the criticism was harmful to the daughter's mental health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression. Public criticism from family members could be detrimental. The husband and mother might not realize the impact of their words, especially given the daughter's history. The user's reaction was to protect their daughter, which is a natural parental instinct.\n\nHowever, the user's language was harsh and confrontational. While the intent was protective, the method involved yelling and a strong curse-laden statement. This could have escalated tensions and might affect family relationships. The user hasn't reached out to apologize, which could be seen as adding to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother criticized the daughter in front of her, which was inappropriate given her mental health history. The user's intervention was a response to protect their daughter's well-being. The key here is whether the user's actions were a necessary defense of their child or an overreaction.\n\nThe user's guilt over losing their temper is valid, but they also had a responsibility to their daughter. The situation is complex, with valid points on both sides. However, the criticism from the husband and mother was the initial harm. The user's reaction, while strong, was a direct response to protect their daughter's mental health. Therefore, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong because the primary issue was the criticism towards the daughter.\n"
