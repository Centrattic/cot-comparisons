We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband in front of their daughter. The situation involves their daughter, who's recovering from depression, being criticized by her father and the user's mother in front of her. The user intervened when they felt the criticism was hurting their daughter's mental health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter was moving forward in her recovery, and the criticism from family members might have triggered her self-image issues. The parents' comments about her being a slob and not taking care of the cat could be seen as invalidating her efforts, especially with her busy schedule. The user stepped in to protect their daughter, which seems like a natural parental response. Yelling and using strong language might not be ideal, but the intent was to stop the negative comments.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's mother and husband were expressing their concerns, maybe without considering the daughter's sensitivities. However, the user's outburst might have caused tension in the family. The user is now feeling bad about their reaction but is also concerned about their daughter's well-being.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether protecting the daughter's mental health justifies the harsh response. Some might argue that there's a better way to handle it without yelling, but others might support the user for standing up for their child during a vulnerable time. The key points are the daughter's mental state and the appropriateness of addressing the issue directly versus calmly. The user's reaction was a moment of high emotion, so while the method might be questionable, the intent was protective. So, the answer might hinge on whether the action was necessary to prevent harm to the daughter, which could make the user not in the wrong, but the method could be improved. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is probably B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
