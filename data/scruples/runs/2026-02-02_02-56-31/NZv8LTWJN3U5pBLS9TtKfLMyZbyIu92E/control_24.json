We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a daughter with depression who's making progress but being criticized by her father and grandmother in front of her, leading to an emotional outburst from the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from all angles. The daughter has a history of depression and is working hard to improve. The father and mother-in-law criticized her cleanliness and her cat ownership in front of her, which upset the daughter. The mother then lost her temper and told them to \"fuck off.\" The question is whether she was wrong to do that.\n\nI should consider the context: the daughter is vulnerable, and public criticism from family members could hinder her recovery. The mother intervened to protect her daughter, which is a natural instinct. However, the method she used was aggressive, which might be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent was good.\n\nOn one hand, the mother's outburst was a reaction to her daughter's emotional distress caused by relatives. On the other hand, using harsh language might not have been the best approach. But given that the daughter was already struggling, the mother's primary concern was her well-being.\n\nThe key points are that the father and mother-in-law were being disrespectful, the daughter was in a fragile state, and the mother acted to defend her. While the response was intense, the intent was protective. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the mother was defending her daughter against harmful criticism. However, some might argue that there's a better way to handle it. But given the daughter's mental health history, the mother's reaction is understandable.\n"
