We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a daughter who's been through a lot, including depression, and her parents and mother-in-law are criticizing her in front of her. The daughter had moved in and has been making a lot of progress, but her messiness and not taking care of the cat are being brought up.\n\nThe user, who is the mother and wife, had to step in and tell her husband and mother to stop. She said something harsh like \"fuck off\" because she felt her daughter was being treated disrespectfully. Now, she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, just coming out of depression, and her mental health is a concern. Publicly criticizing her in front of family might exacerbate her issues. The husband and mother-in-law brought up the messiness in front of her, which led to her emotional breakdown. The user intervened to protect her daughter's feelings, which seems like a protective measure.\n\nBut the user used strong language. Is that justified? Well, maybe she felt there was no other way to stop the conversation. She might not have wanted to escalate the situation but felt it was necessary for her daughter's well-being. The fact that her daughter was crying and saying negative things about herself shows the emotional impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's outburst might have hurt the feelings of her husband and mother, especially since they haven't spoken to her since. However, the user's primary concern was her daughter's mental health. The question is whether the method was appropriate.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, the intent is important. The user's intent was to protect her daughter from further harm. While the language used was harsh, the underlying reason might be seen as justifiable. However, the response could have been more constructive, like addressing the issue calmly rather than yelling.\n\nBut given the emotional state of the daughter and the immediate need to stop the criticism, maybe the user's reaction was a necessary intervention. It's a tough balance between protecting a loved one and maintaining family harmony. The user might not be in the wrong because her actions were motivated by her daughter's well-being, even if the manner could have been better. But in some perspectives, using such language might be seen as overstepping, especially towards family members.\n\nI need to weigh the intent against the method. Since the daughter's mental health is a priority, and the parents-in-law were contributing to her distress, the user's intervention might be the right choice despite the harsh words. Therefore, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong (B).\n"
