We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband in front of their daughter after they were being critical of her messiness.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been through a lot\u2014clinical depression, moving back home, starting a job and school, and therapy. She's made significant progress, which the user and husband are aware of. The daughter's current messiness is likely a residual habit from her depression, and the user is more lenient because she's managing a lot already.\n\nThe husband brings up the messiness in front of the daughter, and the mother joins in, criticizing her, even mentioning the cat's litter box. This public shaming happens when the daughter is already vulnerable. The daughter is upset and starts to feel like a failure, which the user is trying to console her from. But the parents only continue their criticism, leading the user to lose their temper and tell them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nThe user's main concern is their daughter's mental health. They felt that the criticism was harmful and could set her recovery back. The user's reaction was a protective instinct, trying to shield the daughter from further emotional harm. While the approach was harsh, the intention was to defend their child.\n\nOn the other hand, the user acknowledges that they never spoke like that before and now there's a rift in the family. The husband didn't apologize, which might contribute to the tension. However, the user's actions were a response to immediate emotional distress of their daughter.\n\nConsidering the context\u2014protecting a vulnerable loved one from public shaming and potential mental health setbacks\u2014the user's reaction, though extreme, was driven by a desire to protect their daughter. The criticism from the parents was unkind and inappropriate, especially given the daughter's history. The user's outburst was a direct response to that, so while it's a strong reaction, it's not unfounded in the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the user is not in the wrong because they were trying to protect their daughter from emotional harm, even if their method was harsh.\n"
