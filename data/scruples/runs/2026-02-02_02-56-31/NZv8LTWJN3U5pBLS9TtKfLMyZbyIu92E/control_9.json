We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter, husband, and mother criticizing her for being messy in front of her, leading the author to lose their temper and tell them to fuck off. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter recently moved back in after a tough breakup and has a lot on her plate, including a new job, school, therapy, and managing a cat. The daughter was dealing with depression and has shown significant improvement. The husband and mother are criticizing her in front of her, which is clearly hurtful. The daughter is emotionally vulnerable here, given her history with depression.\n\nThe author's reaction was to confront the husband and mother, telling them to be respectful or leave. They took the daughter to get food and calm down. The author hasn't reached out to the others since, but feels bad about losing their temper. The key points here are the public criticism by the husband and mother, the emotional impact on the daughter, and the author's protective stance.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they intervened to protect their daughter from being criticized in front of her, which could exacerbate her mental health issues. However, the way they did it was confrontational. But considering the context, the criticism from the husband and mother was the main issue. The author's anger seems justified given the daughter's vulnerability and the public shaming.\n\nThe husband and mother were being disrespectful, especially since the daughter was already struggling. The author's actions were a defense of their daughter's emotional well-being. While yelling and using strong language (fuck off) might be seen as harsh, the situation was emotionally charged and the author's primary goal was to protect their daughter. \n\nIn AITA contexts, intent and circumstances matter. The author's intent was protective, even if the method was extreme. The husband and mother were at fault for the initial criticism. So the author isn't the one in the wrong here. They acted to defend their daughter from harmful comments. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
