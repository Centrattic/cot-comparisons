We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they were in the wrong when they yelled at their mother and husband for criticizing their daughter in front of her. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The daughter is 26, has depression, and moved in with them after a tough breakup. She's made significant progress\u2014getting a job, going to school, seeing a therapist. The husband is annoyed by her slobbishness, which the user understands given her stress. The mother and husband publicly criticized the daughter in front of her, which led to her emotional breakdown. The user then snapped and told them to either be respectful or \"fuck off.\"\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The key points here are the daughter's mental health and the public criticism. The daughter was already dealing with depression and was making progress. Public shaming from family members, especially about things that are sensitive (like slobbishness and pet care), can be really damaging. The parents (mother and husband) chose to criticize her in front of her, which could undermine her self-esteem and potentially set back her recovery.\n\nThe user's reaction was to stand up for their daughter. They didn't just stay silent; they acted to protect their child's emotional well-being. While the language used (\"fuck off\") might be considered harsh, the intent was to stop the abuse. The user's primary concern was their daughter's mental health, which is valid, especially given the daughter's history.\n\nHowever, the user also mentions that they haven't reached out to their mother and husband since, and they feel bad about losing their temper. But in this scenario, the immediate priority was to shield the daughter from further emotional harm. The user's actions were a defense mechanism to protect their child, not an attack without cause.\n\nSo, considering the context, the criticism was unwarranted and harmful, and the user's response was a reaction to protect their vulnerable daughter. Therefore, they are not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
