Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a flippant comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and then implying she might wish she had a penis. She responded by saying she doesn't want male genitals because they seem uncomfortable and awkward, citing things like needing to constantly adjust them. He got offended and called her sexist, then stormed off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her response was appropriate. She was responding to a comment he made, so it's a direct reply. She's expressing her personal preference and giving reasons based on her observations. The boyfriend is upset because she criticized male anatomy, but he also made a dismissive comment about her body. \n\nThe key here is whether her statement was sexist. Sexism involves prejudice against someone based on their sex. She's expressing her own opinion about her body preferences, not making a judgment about his worth. She's not saying having a penis is worse, just that she doesn't want one. He's taking offense to her honest opinion, which seems like a reaction to criticism rather than valid sexism.\n\nHe also made a comment about her period, which could be seen as minimizing her experience. His reaction to her response might stem from defensiveness. He might feel his own anatomy is being criticized, so he gets upset. But she was responding to his initial comment. \n\nIn terms of wrongness, she's not in the wrong for stating her preference. The boyfriend's issue with her response, calling her sexist, seems misplaced. She's not making a sexist statement but rather expressing her personal view. The boyfriend's reaction might be due to not handling criticism well. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). Her response was a legitimate expression of her feelings, and his reaction is disproportionate and possibly projecting his own insensitivity.\n"
