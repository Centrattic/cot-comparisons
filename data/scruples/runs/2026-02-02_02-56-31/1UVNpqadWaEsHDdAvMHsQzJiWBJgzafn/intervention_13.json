  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and require constant attention, like scratching or adjusting. The boyfriend got offended, called the user sexist, and stormed off, asking them to think about why it was upsetting.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the dynamics here. The user's boyfriend made a derogatory comment about periods and then made a joke implying that having a penis would be better. The user's response was honest about their discomfort with male genitalia. The boyfriend then accuses the user of being sexist for that. \n\nThe key points are: the boyfriend started by making a sexist remark about women's bodies (periods), then made a comment implying that having a penis is better. The user's response is a valid expression of their personal discomfort with male anatomy. The boyfriend's reaction is to accuse the user of sexism, which might be deflecting from his own initial comments. \n\nIs the user wrong? Probably not. They were responding to his comment, pointing out the discomforts of male anatomy. The boyfriend's comment was the initial problem, and the user's response is a legitimate expression of their perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about being defensive and not addressing his own initial sexist remarks. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the user is not in the wrong).\n"
