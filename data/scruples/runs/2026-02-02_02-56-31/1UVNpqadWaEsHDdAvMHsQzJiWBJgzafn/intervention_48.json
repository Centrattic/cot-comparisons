  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started when the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and joked about the person wishing to have a penis. The user responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and stormed off, even though he had previously made negative remarks about vaginas and periods.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the user's response was inappropriate. The boyfriend made a sexist comment by dismissing the user's experience with periods and implying that having a penis is better. The user is pointing out the discomforts of male anatomy, which is a valid response. The boyfriend's offense here seems to stem from the user not valuing the penis, but he had just devalued her experience. The user isn't making a general statement about all men but is responding directly to his comment.\n\nThe boyfriend calling her sexist is ironic because he was the one making a sexist remark. The user's reasoning is based on her observations and personal feelings, which are legitimate. She's not making a broad judgment but expressing her own perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate, especially since he was the one who initiated the conversation with a negative comparison.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is key. If one partner makes a derogatory comment, the other is within their right to challenge it. The user's response was a direct and honest reaction to his remark. The boyfriend's offense without acknowledging his own earlier comments shows a lack of self-awareness. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong here because she's responding to his initial comment and expressing her valid feelings about the topic.\n"
