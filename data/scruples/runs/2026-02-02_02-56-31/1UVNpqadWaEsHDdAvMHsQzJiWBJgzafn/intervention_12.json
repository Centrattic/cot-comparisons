  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responds with \"no, not really,\" and gives reasons why having male genitals seems uncomfortable. The boyfriend then feels offended and calls her sexist. \n\nHmm. So, the user is pointing out the downsides of male genitalia, like discomfort and the need to constantly adjust them. The boyfriend is upset about that. Now, the user is questioning if she's wrong for expressing that opinion.\n\nI need to consider a few factors here. First, the initial comment from the boyfriend might have been dismissive or trivializing her experience with periods. Then, when she responds with her honest opinion about not wanting male genitalia, he takes offense. \n\nIs there a double standard here? The boyfriend is criticizing her for being sexist, but he was making a joke that implies having a penis is better because it avoids dealing with periods. That seems to be a form of sexism as well. The user is just pointing out the other side\u2014male anatomy has its own issues. \n\nShe's not making a generalization about all men or all people with penises. She's talking about her own perspective based on observing her partner's habits. So, if she's expressing her view without attacking him personally, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and not dismissing each other's experiences. The boyfriend's initial comment could be seen as minimizing her period-related experiences. Then, when she counters with her reasons, he's offended. It seems like the issue is about different perspectives and how they handle each other's comments. \n\nI think the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for stating her opinion. She's engaging in a discussion about body parts and their inconveniences. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from a place of defensiveness or not wanting to acknowledge the validity of her perspective. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because she's expressing her honest feelings and pointing out the downsides she observes, which is a valid response to his earlier comment.\n"
