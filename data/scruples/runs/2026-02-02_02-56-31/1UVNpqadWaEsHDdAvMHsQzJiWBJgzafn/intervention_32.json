  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responded \"no, not really,\" explaining that they find male genitals uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend got offended, called it sexist, and left.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial comment from the boyfriend and the user's response. The boyfriend's statement seems to be a bit dismissive of the user's experience with periods, maybe implying that having a penis is better. The user's response is about their personal preferences, pointing out the discomforts they observe in the boyfriend's genital maintenance. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is confusing because he was criticizing periods, which are a natural part of being female, and then gets upset when the user doesn't want the male anatomy. The user isn't making a judgment about the boyfriend's body but expressing their own preferences. \n\nIs the user being sexist? Sexism involves prejudice based on gender. The user is stating a personal preference, not making a generalization about all women or men. They\u2019re pointing out specific discomforts they associate with male genitalia, which is a valid opinion. The boyfriend's reaction might be defensiveness about his own body or feeling criticized. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial trashing of vaginas and periods might be the real issue here. If he's making the user's natural experiences sound negative, then the user's response is just highlighting the flip side. It seems like the boyfriend is upset because his perspective is being challenged, not necessarily because the user is wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They're expressing their personal views, and the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate. The answer should be B.\n"
