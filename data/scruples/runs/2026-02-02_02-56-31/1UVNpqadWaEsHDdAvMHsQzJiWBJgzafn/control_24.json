Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and her boyfriend about not wanting to have a penis. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. She lists reasons like having to scratch or adjust them, which she finds annoying. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for expressing her discomfort with male anatomy. The boyfriend's reaction is that she's being sexist, implying that her view is discriminatory. But the author is stating her personal preferences and observations based on what she sees in her partner's behavior.\n\nI need to consider what sexism entails. Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. If the author is making a generalization about all men or all penises without evidence, that could be problematic. However, she's talking about her own preferences and experiences. She's not making a broad statement about all women not wanting penises, just her own opinion. She also points out her partner's own behavior as a reason for her discomfort, which is a specific example.\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment about being glad not to have periods is a form of dismissing the challenges women face. The author is pushing back against that by stating her reasons for not wanting a penis. It seems like a back-and-forth about gender-based complaints.\n\nThe key here is whether stating a personal preference is sexist. The author isn't devaluing men or making a sweeping judgment about all women. She's expressing her own feelings about her anatomy. The boyfriend's argument that she's being sexist might be invalid because personal preferences aren't automatically sexist unless they're part of a broader discriminatory attitude.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction seems to be out of proportion. He was making a comment that could be seen as minimizing women's experiences (periods), and the author is reacting to that with her own perspective. His getting offended when she shares her honest thoughts might indicate that he's not open to discussing gender differences or is misinterpreting her personal views as a universal statement.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is stating her personal feelings, not making a sexist statement. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism is misplaced here. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
