Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist. The boyfriend first made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend is offended, and the author is confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods before.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author was in the wrong. The key points here are free speech, personal preferences, and whether the statement was sexist. The author is expressing her personal preference about not wanting male anatomy. She's not making a blanket statement about all women, but rather her own feelings. The boyfriend accused her of sexism, which is a claim that would require that she made a discriminatory statement based on gender. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend initially made a derogatory comment about periods and implied that having a vagina is worse. The author's response is a direct reaction to his comment. She's pointing out the discomfort of male genitalia based on her observations of him. Since she's responding to his comment, it's a form of dialogue. She's not making a generalization about all men or women but stating her own perspective. \n\nThe boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling that his anatomy is being criticized, but the author is just expressing her personal preference. The fact that he was previously trashing vaginas and periods could indicate hypocrisy, as he's upset about her comment while he made his own negative remarks. \n\nIn terms of sexism, the author isn't making a generalized negative statement about men's gender. She's talking about physical attributes and her personal feelings towards them. Unless she's making a broader claim about all women's desires, which she isn't, it's not sexist. Therefore, the boyfriend's accusation of sexism seems misplaced. The author is within her rights to express her opinion, especially in response to his initial comment. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's asserting her personal preferences and pointing out the discomfort she observes in male genitalia, which is a valid response to his offhand comment. The boyfriend's reaction appears to be a hypersensitive response to personal criticism, especially after making his own derogatory remarks about her anatomy and periods.\n"
