Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend got offended and called her sexist. Then the author points out that he previously made negative remarks about vaginas and periods.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong to express her discomfort with male anatomy. The boyfriend's reaction is key here. He took offense, but he also made initial comments that were dismissive of her experience with periods. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on her observations and personal feelings. She's stating her perspective, which is a valid form of expression. The boyfriend's offense might be because he feels criticized, but his initial comments were also negative. This could be a case of double standards, where he's upset about the author's opinion but wasn't held accountable for his own.\n\nThe term \"sexist\" is a strong one. Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on sex. The author's statement is about her personal preference and comfort, not a blanket judgment about all men or women. She's not making a generalization that would qualify as sexist; she's expressing her own experience and feelings. \n\nHowever, it's possible the boyfriend interpreted her words as a broad criticism of all men or male anatomy, which might not be her intention. That could be a miscommunication. But given the context, where the boyfriend first made a dismissive comment about her period, her response seems like a direct and honest answer to his question.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of storming off and making her think about why it was upsetting might indicate that he's more focused on his own feelings being hurt rather than engaging in a constructive dialogue. The author is being honest about her preferences, which is not inherently wrong. She's also pointing out his previous negative comments, which could be a valid point in the argument.\n\nIn summary, the author is expressing her personal feelings in response to his initial comments. She's not making a sexist statement but rather stating her comfort level. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced given his own prior remarks. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
