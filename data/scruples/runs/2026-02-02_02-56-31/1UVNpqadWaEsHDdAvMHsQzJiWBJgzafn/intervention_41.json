  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with a comment about periods and then shifted to a discussion about preferring not having male genitalia. The boyfriend got upset, called her sexist, and left. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment about her period and implied she might wish she had a penis. The user's response is about her discomfort with male genitalia, pointing out things like discomfort and maintenance. He took offense, calling it sexist. \n\nNow, the user is asking whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key here is whether her statement was inappropriate. She's expressing her personal preference and reasons, which are based on observations. She's not attacking him personally but stating her own feelings. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about feeling criticized than her having a valid opinion.\n\nSexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. Here, she's making a subjective statement about her own preferences, not making a broad negative generalization about all men or their bodies. She's not devaluing his gender but expressing her own view on a body part. The boyfriend's comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods is actually a sexist remark, as it dismisses her experience and implies his situation is better.\n\nThe user's response is a legitimate expression of her perspective. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling his masculinity is being questioned, but that's his issue. The user isn't in the wrong for standing by her opinion. So the answer should be B.\n"
