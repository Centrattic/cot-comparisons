Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he gets offended, calling her sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period and said she might wish she had a dick. The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because of the discomfort and maintenance involved, like dealing with male genitalia. The boyfriend then gets upset, says she's being sexist, and storms off.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial comment from the boyfriend and the author's response. The boyfriend's remark could be seen as dismissive or minimizing the challenges of menstruation, which is a valid issue. The author's response is about her personal preference and observations of his behavior. She points out things like him scratching or adjusting his genitalia, which she finds inconvenient. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to label her remarks as sexist. That's an interesting point. Sexism usually involves prejudice based on gender. The author is expressing her opinion about not wanting a male anatomy, which is different from making a generalized negative statement about men. However, the boyfriend might feel that her comment is a derogatory comparison between male and female anatomy.\n\nBut the author's argument is based on her personal experience and preferences. She's not making a broad statement about all men or their experiences, just her own perspective. The boyfriend's initial comment about being glad not to have periods could be seen as trivializing a real health issue. So there's a power dynamic here where he's downplaying her experience, and she's pushing back by pointing out the discomforts of male anatomy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's responding to his comment. If he made a flippant remark about her bodily experiences, her countering with her own observations might be a valid response. Plus, she's not making a sexist claim against men; she's expressing her own discomfort with male anatomy. The boyfriend's labeling her as sexist might be a deflection or an attempt to shut down the conversation. \n\nHowever, could her response be seen as a bit harsh or not appropriate in the context? She's pointing out his behaviors, which might make him feel criticized. But given that he started the conversation with a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience, her response is a form of holding him accountable. \n\nI think the key here is whether her statement is sexist. Since she's not making a generalization about all men or their worth based on gender, but rather a personal preference about anatomy, she's not being sexist. Therefore, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
