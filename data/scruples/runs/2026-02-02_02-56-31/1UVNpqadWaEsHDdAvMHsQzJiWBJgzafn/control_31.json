Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple having a disagreement where the boyfriend comments on not having to deal with periods, and the author responds by saying she doesn't want a penis because she finds male genitals uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend gets upset, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out if the author's response was justified. The boyfriend made a flippant comment about not having to deal with periods, which is a common issue where men might trivialize women's health. The author is pushing back against that by pointing out the downsides of male anatomy. But the boyfriend takes offense, saying she's being sexist. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's statement was sexist. She's expressing her personal preference, not making a judgment about the inherent value of men or their anatomy. She's pointing out specific discomforts she observes in her boyfriend's daily habits. That seems like a valid personal opinion rather than sexism. The boyfriend's reaction might be defensiveness because his gender identity is being critiqued, even if it's in a light-hearted way. However, he had just made a dismissive comment about periods, which is a form of sexism against women. The author is responding to that by highlighting the other side, which could be seen as balancing the discussion.\n\nThe boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling that his anatomy is being criticized, but the author is not making a general statement about all men. She's talking about her own perspective. The fact that he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier makes his reaction seem more like defensiveness than a valid point. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's asserting her viewpoint in response to his dismissive comment. The boyfriend's reaction is perhaps more problematic because he's not considering her perspective and is instead getting upset about being challenged. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
