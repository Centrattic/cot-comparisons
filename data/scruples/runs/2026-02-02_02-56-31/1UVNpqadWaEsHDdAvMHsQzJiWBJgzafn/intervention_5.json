Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after expressing that they don't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend commenting on her period and making a joke about wishing she had a penis. She responded that she didn't want one because it's uncomfortable, pointing out things like needing to scratch or adjust. He got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the arguments from both sides. The boyfriend was making a joke about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, which could be seen as dismissive or minimizing her experience. Then, when she resists the idea of having a penis, he gets upset and labels her as sexist. That's interesting because he was the one making a comment that implies a preference for male biology, but then accuses her of sexism when she expresses a different view.\n\nThe key here is whether her statement is sexist. Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender, often in a negative way towards one gender. In this case, she's expressing a personal preference based on perceived discomforts of male genitalia. She's not making a general negative statement about men or their biology as a whole, just stating her personal discomfort. So, unless she's making a broad, derogatory statement about men, her comment doesn't seem sexist. Instead, it's a personal choice based on her observations and preferences.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that his biology is being criticized. However, he initiated the conversation by commenting on her period in a way that could be seen as trivializing her experience. His reaction to her response might be more about defensiveness than sexism. He called her sexist, which is an accusation that doesn't hold up if she's not making a broad, unfair generalization.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier adds context. If he was making dismissive comments about her experience and then gets upset when she counters his point, it's more about his own defensiveness. His argument that she's sexist is a mischaracterization of her stance. She's not opposing men or male biology in a sexist way; she's simply stating her preference and reasoning based on personal discomfort.\n\nIn terms of communication, it's clear there's a misunderstanding. She's expressing personal preferences, while he interprets it as an attack on his gender. The boyfriend might need to reflect on why he feels so defensive about her comments. Meanwhile, the user isn't wrong for standing by her opinion, especially when it's based on her own observations and comfort levels.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The user isn't in the wrong. She's expressing a personal view that isn't sexist, and the boyfriend's reaction is misplaced given his initial comments.\n"
