  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and saying something about wishing he had a dick. The user responds that they don't really want a penis, finding male genitals uncomfortable. The boyfriend gets offended and calls it sexist, then storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend made a dismissive or trivializing comment about periods, which is a sensitive topic. Then he made a sarcastic remark implying that having a penis is better. The user's response is about their personal preference and discomfort with male genitalia, which they explain as practical reasons rather than preference. The boyfriend took offense, saying it's sexist, and the user is confused because he was previously making negative comments about female biology.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, the user was responding to their partner's comment. They didn't make a sexist statement; they expressed their personal feelings. The boyfriend's initial comments were dismissive of women's experiences. The user's response is about their own body and how they feel about different anatomies. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized, but the user was just stating their perspective. There's a double standard here\u2014when the boyfriend makes a negative comment about periods, it's accepted, but when the user expresses a negative view about male anatomy, it's called sexist. That seems unfair. The user isn't making a blanket statement about all men, just their own preference. So, the answer is likely B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
