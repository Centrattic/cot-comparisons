Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with her period, then saying she might wish she had a penis. The author responds that she doesn't want a penis, finding male genitals uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calling her sexist, and leaves her to think about it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who might be at fault here. The boyfriend's initial comment seems dismissive and possibly trivializing the author's experience with menstruation. That's not cool. Then he makes a joke about her wishing to have a penis, which could be seen as a form of shaming or putting her on the defensive about her body. The author's response is based on her genuine observations and discomfort with male genitalia, which she's expressing honestly. She points out his own behavior\u2014scratching and adjusting his genitals\u2014as a reason for her discomfort, which is a valid point.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to being called out is where things might get complicated. He gets \"weirdly offended\" and labels her as sexist. That's an accusation that might not hold water here because the author is expressing her personal experience and preference, not making a general negative statement about all men or their genitalia. Sexism usually involves prejudice based on gender, but the author is making a specific comment about the physical aspects of male genitalia, not about men as a gender. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's issue might stem from feeling criticized, even though the author was just sharing her perspective. His storming off and asking her to reflect could be seen as overreacting. The key here is whether the author's statement is sexist. Since she's not devaluing women or men based on their gender, just stating her personal comfort level with certain anatomy, it seems like the boyfriend is misapplying the term \"sexist.\" \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comments about periods and the implication that having a penis is better could be seen as the root of the problem. He's making a comparison that might be undermining her experience. The author, by responding with her honest feelings, is not in the wrong. She's addressing the issue he brought up. The boyfriend's defensiveness and the accusation of sexism don't justify his reaction. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). The boyfriend's behavior was the initial problem, and his taking offense to her factual response is unwarranted. The author has every right to express her preferences about her body without being called sexist.\n"
