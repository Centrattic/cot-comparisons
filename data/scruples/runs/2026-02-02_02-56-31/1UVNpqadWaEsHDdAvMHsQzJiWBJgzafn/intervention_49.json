  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation during her period where the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her response was inappropriate. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as trivializing her period, which is a common topic in discussions about gender differences. His remark about wishing she had a penis might come off as dismissive or minimizing her experience. By responding with her reasons for not wanting a penis, she's expressing her personal discomfort, which is a valid reaction.\n\nThe boyfriend's offense seems misplaced here. She's not making a generalization about all men but is sharing her own perspective based on observations. His reaction could stem from feeling attacked or misunderstood. However, his initial comment about periods and making a joke about having a penis might set the tone for the conversation. She's just pushing back against his assumption that having a penis is better, which is a reasonable response.\n\nThe term \"sexist\" might be the boyfriend misapplying the label. Sexism involves prejudice based on gender, often in a derogatory way. In this case, she's not making a negative generalization about men as a group but is stating her personal preference and observations. So, she's not being sexist here.\n\nWhether she's in the wrong depends on the context. If the boyfriend felt disrespected, maybe there's a communication issue. But her response is a legitimate expression of her feelings based on his initial comment. The boyfriend's reaction seems overly sensitive. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
