Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expressing that they don't want a penis to their boyfriend. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period, and then saying something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that they don't want male genitalia because they find them uncomfortable and awkward.\n\nThe boyfriend then gets offended, calling her sexist. The author counters by pointing out that he was previously criticizing vaginas and periods. Now, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience (periods) and suggesting she might prefer being male. The author's response about not wanting a penis is a personal opinion. It's her right to express her feelings about her body. The boyfriend's reaction of being offended by her honest opinion might be misplaced. He started the conversation with a comment that could be seen as dismissive of her experience, so the author's response is a legitimate reaction to that.\n\nThe key here is that the author is stating her personal preference and experiences. She's not making a general statement about all people but rather explaining her own views. The boyfriend's offense over her truthful expression of her feelings seems to be the issue here. Additionally, the boyfriend had previously made comments about vaginas and periods, which the author is now pointing out, showing inconsistency in his reactions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her honest opinion, especially in response to his initial comment. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
