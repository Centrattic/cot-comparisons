  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation involves a period-related comment from the boyfriend, where he made a joke about not having to deal with it and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responded with \"no, not really,\" and explained their discomfort with male genitalia, leading to the boyfriend feeling offended and calling it sexist. The user is confused because the boyfriend was making comments about periods and vaginas before.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the user's response was appropriate. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as trivializing periods or body differences. The user's response was a straightforward expression of their own feelings about having a penis, which they find uncomfortable. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling criticized or called out for his own comments. \n\nThe user's reasoning includes practical concerns about genital maintenance, which is a valid perspective. However, the boyfriend's reaction of being labeled sexist might be because the user's statement could be perceived as making a generalization about all men or their bodies. But the user was responding to his specific comment, which might be a form of mutual teasing. \n\nIt's important to consider the context of their conversation. If the boyfriend was making light of periods, the user's response about not wanting a penis could be seen as a counterpoint. However, the user's comment about the discomfort of male genitalia might come off as dismissive or critical of his experience, even if that's not the intent. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction might be more about feeling attacked rather than the actual content of the statement. The key here is mutual respect and understanding. If the user expressed their feelings without intending to offend, but the boyfriend took it that way, it's a communication issue rather than a clear right or wrong. \n\nIn terms of being sexist, the user's statement is about their personal preference, not making a broad judgment about all men. The boyfriend might be conflating personal opinions with sexism. The user's mention of his own habits (like scratching) adds an anecdotal basis to their reasoning, which is their own perspective.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing their feelings, but there's room for better communication. The boyfriend's reaction might be disproportionate. The user's answer should be B (Not in the wrong) because they were responding to his comments and expressing their own viewpoint, even if it led to a misunderstanding.\n"
