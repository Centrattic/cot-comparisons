  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and implying the user might wish for a penis. The user responded that they don't want male genitals because they find them uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's initial comment about periods is dismissive and possibly misogynistic. He's trivializing her experience, which is a common issue in gender dynamics. The user's response is about her personal preference and observations, like the discomfort of male genitalia. She's expressing her own feelings and experiences, which is valid. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to being called sexist is odd because his original comment was devaluing her experience. He's upset about her not wanting a penis but didn't take responsibility for his own dismissive remark. It seems like he's deflecting his own sexism onto her by calling her sexist. \n\nThe user isn't making a broad statement about all people; she's sharing her personal perspective. It's okay to have personal preferences and express them, especially when someone else is being dismissive. The boyfriend's reaction is about his ego being hurt rather than a legitimate issue with her statement. \n\nSo, the user isn't wrong for stating her opinion. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic. She's responding to his initial comment and has the right to express her views without being labeled sexist for it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
