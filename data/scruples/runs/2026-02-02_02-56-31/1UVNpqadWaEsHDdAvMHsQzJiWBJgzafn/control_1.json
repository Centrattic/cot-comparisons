Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple discussing their bodies and preferences. The boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period, then says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because she finds male genitals uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend started by making a flippant comment about not having to deal with periods, which is a bit dismissive of her experience. Then he says she might wish she had a penis, which could imply that having a period is a downside of being female. The author's response is that she doesn't want a penis because of the physical discomfort and maintenance she observes in him. He reacts negatively, calling her sexist, which seems contradictory because he was just making a comment about periods.\n\nIs the author sexist? Well, she's expressing a personal preference based on her observations. She's not making a blanket statement about all men or women, just her own feelings. She's also pointing out the maintenance aspect, which he was doing himself. The boyfriend's reaction seems to take it as a personal attack, but she's just stating her perspective. He was the one who initiated the discussion with a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience with periods. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's being honest about her preferences, and the boyfriend's offense might be misplaced. The answer should be B.\n"
