  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation is that during their period, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with it and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responded \"no, not really,\" and then explained why having male genitals would be uncomfortable. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nHmm. So the user says male genitals seem uncomfortable, like the idea of having to deal with testicles and other stuff. The boyfriend took offense and said she was sexist. She's confused because he was making negative comments about periods and vaginas, but she's the one being called sexist for her response.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if her response was inappropriate. She's expressing a personal opinion about not wanting male genitalia because she finds it inconvenient or uncomfortable. That's a personal preference. However, the boyfriend took it as sexist. But the boyfriend also made negative remarks about female biology. So maybe there's a double standard here.\n\nIn terms of sexism, maybe the boyfriend felt she was making a generalized negative comment about male bodies. But she's explaining her own preferences based on observations. She's not saying all women feel that way or that male bodies are worse overall. She's stating her personal view. So perhaps she's not in the wrong for expressing her opinion, especially since he was also making dismissive comments about women's experiences.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might be about defensiveness. He could feel that she's criticizing his body or implying his anatomy is inferior. But the user was responding to a comment he made first. He brought up the topic by saying he was glad he didn't have to deal with periods and implied she might want a penis. So she's just responding to his initial comment.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's statement \"I bet you wish you had a dick\" could be seen as a form of subtle sexism, suggesting that having a penis is better. Her refusal to agree could be a valid response. Then his calling her sexist for not wanting a penis might be the real issue here. Because she's not making a general statement about all men or their bodies being inferior, but rather stating her personal comfort level.\n\nSo in terms of right and wrong, the user's response is a personal opinion and not inherently sexist. The boyfriend's initial comment and subsequent reaction might be more problematic. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
