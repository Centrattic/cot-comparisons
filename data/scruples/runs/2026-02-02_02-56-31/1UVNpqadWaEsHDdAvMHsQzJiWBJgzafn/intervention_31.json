Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and implying the user might wish she had a penis. She responded that she doesn't want a penis because it's uncomfortable and messy, like he has to scratch or adjust his genitals multiple times a day. He got offended, called her sexist, and left to let her think. She's confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods before.\n\nSo, the user is asking if she's wrong here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break down the key points. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment that was dismissive of her menstrual experience and made a joke about her wishing to have a penis. This could be seen as invalidating her experience. The user then stated her honest opinion about not wanting a penis, citing discomfort and maintenance. The boyfriend took offense, called her sexist, and left. \n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the user was wrong to express her opinion. The boyfriend's initial comment was probably the root of the problem. He was being dismissive and making a joke that might imply that having a period is worse than having a penis. The user's response was a counterpoint, pointing out the downsides of having male genitalia, which she observed in him. \n\nIs she being sexist? The user is making a personal preference based on her observations. She's not making a generalization about all men or women, just stating her own feelings. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be defensiveness because his own body was criticized, even if it's in a humorous or hypothetical way. \n\nThe boyfriend's previous trashing of vaginas and periods adds context. If he was making negative comments about her body, her pointing out the downsides of his body isn't inherently sexist. She's responding to his comments with her own perspective. \n\nIn terms of communication, it's possible the boyfriend felt his masculinity was being attacked, leading him to perceive her comments as sexist. However, the user's comments were about her own preferences, not a judgment of his gender. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was dismissive and then defensive. She was responding to his initial comment with her own views. Therefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
