  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he took offense, calling her sexist. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded that she doesn't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable and messy, and he got mad, saying she's sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's comment about not having to deal with periods could be seen as dismissive or minimizing her experience. Periods are a real physical and emotional experience, so his comment might be insensitive. Then he says she must wish she had a penis, which might be implying that having a period is worse than having a penis. Her response is about the physical aspects of having male genitalia, like needing to scratch or adjust them, which she finds annoying. He's offended and calls her sexist, which is confusing because she's pointing out the downsides he's ignoring.\n\nIs she in the wrong? She's expressing her personal preferences and observations. She's not making a general statement about all people or genders. She's responding to his comment, which had a gendered implication. Her response is about her own body and preferences. He's taking her literal statement as an attack, but it's just her honest opinion. His initial comment was probably more problematic, and he's projecting his own sexism onto her. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
