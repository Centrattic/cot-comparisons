  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The key points here are the context of their conversation and their boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and mentioned, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responded negatively, explaining that they find male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend then got offended, calling the user sexist. \n\nThe user is confused because the boyfriend previously trashed vaginas and periods, yet he's upset about her opinion. The crux here is whether the user's comments were sexist or just a personal opinion. Sexism usually involves prejudice or stereotyping based on gender. The user is expressing a personal preference or discomfort with male anatomy, not making a judgment about the worth of men. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to conflate personal preferences with sexism, which isn't accurate. The user is not demeaning men as a gender; they're commenting on physical characteristics. Additionally, the boyfriend's earlier comments about periods and vaginas being negative indicate he's already made disparaging remarks about female anatomy. \n\nIn this case, the user is not being sexist. They're stating their own perspective based on observation and personal experience. The boyfriend's defensiveness and labeling it as sexism might stem from feeling criticized, but it doesn't make the user wrong. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's views, even if they differ. The user isn't in the wrong here; the issue is more about the boyfriend's sensitivity and past comments.\n"
