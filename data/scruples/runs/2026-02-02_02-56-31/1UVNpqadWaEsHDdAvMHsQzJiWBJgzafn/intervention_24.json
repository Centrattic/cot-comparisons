  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation is a bit of a back-and-forth.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and said something about the user wishing they had a penis. The user replied they didn't want a penis, explaining that male genitals are uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend got offended, called it sexist, and stormed off, even though he had just been trashing vaginas and periods.\n\nHmm, the user is confused why their boyfriend is upset. They're pointing out that he was making negative comments about the female experience, but when they express discomfort with male anatomy, he takes it as offensive. \n\nI need to consider if the user was in the wrong. The user's response was a honest opinion about their anatomy preferences. They observed him adjusting his genitals, which they find inconvenient. The boyfriend's reaction seems hypocritical, as he was making light of the challenges of being female. \n\nThe boyfriend's offense might stem from taking the comment as a personal attack, but the user's statement was a personal preference, not a judgment. It's possible he felt his identity was being criticized, but the user was just expressing their own view. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial comments about periods might have set the tone for the argument. If he was making fun, the user's response could be a valid pushback. The key here is whether the user crossed a line by stating their preference, which they probably didn't. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the user was expressing their honest feelings without attacking the boyfriend personally. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and hypocritical given his earlier comments.\n"
