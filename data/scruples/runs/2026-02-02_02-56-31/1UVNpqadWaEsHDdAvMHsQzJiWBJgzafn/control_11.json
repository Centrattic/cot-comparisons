Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is between a boyfriend and girlfriend. The boyfriend made a comment about the girlfriend not having a penis, which she responded to by saying she doesn't want one. He got upset and accused her of being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend was complaining about her period, then made a joke about wishing she had a penis. She told him she doesn't want a penis because of the physical discomfort and maintenance (like scratching, rearranging). He took offense and called her sexist. The question is whether she was wrong for saying so.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The boyfriend's initial comment was probably a bit dismissive or maybe a bit flippant about her period. His comment about her wishing she had a penis might come across as minimizing her experience. The author's response is about her personal feelings towards male genitalia, which she finds uncomfortable. She's not making a general statement about all men or penises, but expressing her own preferences and observations.\n\nHe's upset and calls her sexist. But sexism is about prejudice or discrimination based on sex. If she's just stating her personal opinion, that's not necessarily sexist. Unless she's making a broad negative generalization about all men or all penises. From her description, she's talking about her own feelings and what she observes him doing. So, maybe she's not being sexist, just expressing a personal choice.\n\nThe boyfriend was the one making a comment about her body and period, which could be seen as dismissive. Then when she responds honestly, he's offended. The author is confused because he was \"trashing vaginas and periods\" earlier, but that's okay. So there's a double standard here. The boyfriend's initial comments might have been the start of the problem, and the author's response was a legitimate reaction to his remarks.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like she was responding to his comment, and her statement is about her own preferences. Unless she was making a sexist generalization, which doesn't seem to be the case. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
