Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation where the boyfriend comments on her period and jokes about wishing she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't, finds male genitalia uncomfortable and messy, and he gets offended, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her response was inappropriate. The boyfriend's initial comment was a bit dismissive of her period and maybe a bit gendered, implying that not having a period is better. She's pushing back against that by expressing her discomfort with male anatomy. Her reasons are based on observation, like him scratching or adjusting his genitals, which she finds annoying. \n\nIs it sexist to say she doesn't want a penis? Sexism involves prejudice based on gender. If she's making a generalized negative statement about a gender's anatomy, that could be seen as sexist. However, in this context, she's responding to his comment about her period, which was also a bit dismissive. She's pointing out the discomforts of male anatomy as a counter. \n\nBut when someone says \"I wish I had a penis\" or the opposite, it can sometimes be a way of perpetuating stereotypes. However, in this case, she's not saying it's better to be male or female but pointing out specific anatomical differences. The boyfriend's offense might come from feeling that she's devaluing his male experience by highlighting the maintenance involved. \n\nOn the other hand, his initial comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period is also a form of gendered comparison. She's responding to his comment, which could be seen as a form of back-and-forth about gender differences. \n\nThe key here is whether her statement is sexist. If she's making a sweeping generalization that all men's genitalia are uncomfortable, that's one thing. But she's speaking from her own perspective, which is valid. However, calling someone sexist for not wanting a penis might be a stretch. Alternatively, if she were to make a statement that all men are better off without periods, that would be different. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be based on defensiveness, interpreting her comments as a personal attack rather than her expressing her personal experience. The question is whether her statement is in the wrong. Since she's stating her personal preference and experience, not making a broader judgment about all men or women, she might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut there's a line between personal preference and sexist generalization. If she's implying that male anatomy is inherently worse or that being male is less desirable, that's sexist. However, her reasoning is about physical discomfort, which is a personal opinion. The boyfriend's claim that she's being sexist might not be accurate unless she's making a value judgment about the entire gender. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is expressing her personal discomfort with male anatomy as a reason she doesn't want a penis. This is a personal choice and not necessarily sexist unless she's making a broader claim against all men. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
