  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a conversation between them and their boyfriend regarding having a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and joked about the person wishing they had a penis. The person responded negatively, explaining they find male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend got offended, called them sexist, and left to think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend was making a joke or a dismissive comment about periods and female anatomy. The person is countering by pointing out the discomfort of male genitalia. The boyfriend's reaction is that they're being sexist. Is there a double standard here?\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment might be seen as minimizing the challenges of having a period, which is a valid issue. The person is responding by highlighting the challenges of male anatomy, which could be a way to show that both have their own issues. But the boyfriend takes offense, implying that pointing out male genital discomfort is sexist. That seems odd because he wasn't criticized for his earlier comments about vaginas and periods.\n\nIs the person wrong for expressing their opinion? They're sharing their perspective on why having a penis isn't desirable. Unless they were making a generalization that's harmful, their statement seems like a personal preference. The boyfriend's reaction of calling them sexist and getting angry might be more about defensiveness than a valid point. \n\nAlso, considering the context, the boyfriend was the one who started the conversation by trashing periods and vaginas. The person is responding to his comment, so they're not starting the conflict. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced here. \n\nIn terms of sexism, if the person is pointing out valid, observed differences in comfort and care required for different anatomy, that's not inherently sexist. It's more about personal experience. The boyfriend's comment about wishing he had a vagina earlier might not be acknowledged as problematic, while the person's comment is being criticized. That seems inconsistent.\n\nSo, the person isn't in the wrong for expressing their genuine feelings about the topic. The boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and possibly deflection from his own comments. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
