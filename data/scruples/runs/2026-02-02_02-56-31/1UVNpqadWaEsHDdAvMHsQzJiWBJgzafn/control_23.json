Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation where the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and implies the author might wish she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't want a penis, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and require constant attention, which offends him, leading to an argument where he accuses her of sexism.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her response was inappropriate. She's expressing her personal preference and giving reasons based on her observations of his grooming habits. There's no direct attack on his masculinity or derogatory terms. She's stating her perspective as a woman, which is her right. The boyfriend, on the other hand, made a dismissive comment about periods and then got upset when she disagreed with his implication. It seems like there's a mix of gendered assumptions here. The boyfriend's reaction to her honest response might stem from defensiveness or feeling that her comment is sexist, but his initial remark about trashing vaginas and periods could be more problematic. The key here is whether her statement was sexist. She's voicing a preference based on her experience, not making a generalization that's discriminatory. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced, especially since he started the conversation with a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
