  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation is that during her period, he made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded \"no, not really,\" and explained that having male genitals seems uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended, called her sexist, and stormed off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The boyfriend made a dismissive or perhaps teasing comment about her period, then suggested she might prefer having a penis. She's pointing out the discomforts of male genitalia, which her boyfriend finds offensive. He called her sexist, which is a bit of a red flag. Sexism usually involves prejudice based on gender, but here she's making a personal preference statement, not devaluing an entire gender. \n\nHer argument is based on her personal observation and discomfort with male genitalia, which he's doing regularly. She's responding to his initial comment, which was trashing periods and vaginas. He's the one who started with a gendered derogatory remark, and she's countering with her perspective.\n\nHe's getting upset about her stating her opinion, even though he made the initial inflammatory comment. The fact that he's trashing her anatomy (vaginas and periods) but then gets upset when she comments on his anatomy (penis) is a bit hypocritical. Also, his reaction of calling her sexist might be a deflection or an attempt to shut down the conversation.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, she's not wrong for expressing her opinion, especially since he initiated the discussion. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from defensiveness rather than constructive dialogue. His statement that she should \"think about\" why her comment was upsetting is a bit of a cop-out. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, she's not. She's responding to his initial comment, and her reasoning is based on personal observation. The boyfriend's offense might stem from ego or a desire to avoid criticism of his own anatomy, but that doesn't make her right or wrong. The key here is that he started the conversation with a derogatory comment, and she's just pushing back. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
