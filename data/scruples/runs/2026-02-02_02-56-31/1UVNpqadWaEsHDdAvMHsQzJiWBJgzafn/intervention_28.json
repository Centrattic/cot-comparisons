Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they were wrong in their response to their boyfriend's comment. The situation is that the boyfriend made a flippant remark about not having to deal with her period and implied she might wish she had a penis. The user responded by saying male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward, and her boyfriend got offended, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the user was in the wrong. The boyfriend's initial comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods is likely dismissive or minimizing the challenges of her period. Then he says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick,\" which seems like a backhanded compliment or a way to put her down. The user's response is a honest reflection of her feelings about male anatomy, which she finds uncomfortable. Her boyfriend's reaction is to be upset and accuse her of being sexist.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, when someone makes a joke or comment that's dismissive or degrading (like the boyfriend's initial remarks), the other person is within their right to express their discomfort or disagreement. The user is not attacking him personally but stating her perspective. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism here is misplaced if he was the one making a joke that trivializes her experience. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction might stem from a sense of defensiveness or a belief that his anatomy shouldn't be criticized. But in a relationship, both partners should be able to express their views without fear of being labeled sexist or offensive unless the criticism is indeed sexist. The user's comment is more about personal preference and observation rather than a blanket sexist statement against all men. \n\nSo, the user's response seems like a valid reaction to what he said. The boyfriend's initial comments were probably more problematic, and the user's response is a legitimate expression of her feelings. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
