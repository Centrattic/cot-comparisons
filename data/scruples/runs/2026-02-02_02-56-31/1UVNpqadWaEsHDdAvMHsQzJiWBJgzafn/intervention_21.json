  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation where the boyfriend made a sarcastic comment about periods, and the user responded by saying they don't want a penis because it's uncomfortable. He got upset, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of periods, which is a common experience for many women. The user's response was based on her personal preference about body parts, which she articulated as finding male genitalia uncomfortable. The boyfriend took offense and labeled her as sexist, which might be because he felt being told he shouldn't have a penis is a personal attack. However, the user isn't saying all men are bad, just expressing a personal view on anatomy. \n\nThe key here is whether the user's statement was sexist or not. Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The user is stating her own preference, not making a generalization about all men or their worth. She's also pointing out the practical aspects like discomfort, which is a valid personal opinion. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from defensiveness rather than sexism. \n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's earlier comments about periods were negative, which adds context. The user was responding to his comment in the same conversation. The fact that he got upset about her not wanting a penis but didn't object to his own comments about periods might indicate inconsistency in his reaction. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't being sexist. She's expressing her personal feelings. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and possibly misdirected. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
