  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after a conversation with their boyfriend. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded with \"no, not really,\" and then explained that she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended, called her sexist, and left to \"think.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend started by making a comment that could be seen as dismissing her experience with periods. Then he made a provocative statement implying that having a penis might be better. The user's response is a straightforward expression of her personal discomfort with male anatomy. \n\nShe's not making a general statement about all women or all men, but rather sharing her own perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about being defensive or feeling attacked, possibly because his masculinity is being questioned. However, the user isn't attacking his gender; she's expressing a personal preference based on her observations (like him scratching or adjusting his genitals). \n\nThe key here is whether her comments were sexist. Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. Her statement is about her own preferences and observations, not a broad negative generalization about men's bodies. She's not saying men are inferior or that having a penis is bad for men, just that she personally wouldn't want to have them due to discomfort. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist and getting upset might stem from feeling that his body or his gender is being criticized, but the user's comments are specific and personal. There's no indication she's making a broader judgment about men. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't in the wrong for expressing her honest feelings. The boyfriend's response seems to be an overreaction, possibly due to defensiveness from his initial dismissive comment about periods. The user's response was a valid expression of her perspective, and the boyfriend should have respected that rather than taking it as an attack on his gender. \n\nSo the answer is B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
