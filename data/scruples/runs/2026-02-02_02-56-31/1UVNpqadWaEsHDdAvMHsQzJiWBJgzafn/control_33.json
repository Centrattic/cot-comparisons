Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a woman) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to have a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, then saying something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded she doesn't want a penis because she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and messy. Her boyfriend got upset, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's response is valid. The boyfriend's initial comment seems dismissive or even mocking of her period, then makes a joke about her wishing to have a penis. His comment could be seen as a form of reverse sexism or minimizing her experience. The author's response is about her personal preference and discomfort with male anatomy. She's not making a general statement about all men, just her own feelings. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is confusing because he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier. Now he's upset about her rejecting male anatomy. The user is confused because the boyfriend's behavior seems inconsistent. The key here is whether the author is being sexist by expressing her preference. Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on sex, often in a negative way. However, if someone is expressing a personal preference or opinion about their own body, that's different. \n\nThe author is stating her own perspective: she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and doesn't want them. This is a personal choice and not a blanket judgment about all men or their anatomy. The boyfriend's accusation that she's sexist is misplaced because she's not devaluing men or their bodies, just stating her personal preference. His getting offended might be due to misunderstanding or defensiveness, especially after he made the initial joke. \n\nIt's also important to note that the boyfriend's initial comments about periods and the comment \"I bet you wish you had a dick\" could be considered a form of gendered double standard. The author is pushing back against that by expressing her genuine feelings about not wanting male anatomy. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding to her boyfriend's comments with her honest perspective. The boyfriend's reaction is unjustified, especially since he was the one who first made the negative comment. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
