Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because male genitals are uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets upset, calls her sexist, and storms off. The author is confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods before.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a joke that was probably meant to be light-hearted but came off as dismissive of her experience with periods. The author's response is about her personal preference regarding body parts, which is valid. She's expressing her discomfort with male genitalia, which is a personal choice and not inherently sexist. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from defensiveness, maybe feeling insulted by her honest opinion. The fact that he was trashing vaginas earlier complicates things, as his behavior shows a pattern of dismissing her bodily experiences. The author's stance is about her own preferences, not making a general statement about all men. So, she's not being sexist. The boyfriend's reaction is misplaced. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
