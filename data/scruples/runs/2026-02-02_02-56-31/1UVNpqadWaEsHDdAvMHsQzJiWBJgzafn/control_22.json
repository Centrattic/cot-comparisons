Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a conversation between the author and her boyfriend about gender anatomy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because she finds male genitals uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. \n\nThe author is confused because he was criticizing vaginas and periods earlier. The question is whether she's wrong for her response.\n\nHmm. From the boyfriend's perspective, he might feel that the author is making a negative judgment about his anatomy, implying that having a penis is inferior. That could be why he called her sexist\u2014because he perceives her as making a generalized negative statement about men's bodies. But on the other hand, the author is responding to his initial comment which was dismissive of her experience with periods. She's pointing out the discomforts of male genitalia, which could be seen as a valid observation rather than sexist if it's based on real experiences.\n\nSexism usually involves prejudice based on gender, often stereotyping or devaluing one gender. The author is talking about physical aspects of anatomy that she finds undesirable. If she's not making a generalized negative statement about men as a gender, but rather speaking about the anatomy, maybe she's not being sexist. However, if she's implying that having a penis is worse, that could be seen as a value judgment, which could be considered sexist if it's based on stereotypes.\n\nBut the boyfriend's initial comment was trashing the author's experience with periods. His statement \"I bet you wish you had a dick\" might be implying that having a period is worse than having a penis, which is a comparison that could be seen as invalidating her experience. The author's response is pointing out the discomforts of having male genitalia, which could be a fair counterpoint. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the boyfriend's reaction might be over the top. He made a dismissive comment about her period, and she's calling out the flip side. But the boyfriend might feel that she's making him feel devalued by his anatomy. The key is whether the author's comments are sexist. If she's making a personal choice based on her observations without generalizing all men or men's experiences, she might not be in the wrong. However, if she's making a broad negative statement about male anatomy without considering individual differences, that could be seen as sexist.\n\nIn this case, the author mentions specific observations about her boyfriend's behavior (scratching nuts, rearranging junk), which are personal and specific. She's not making a broad statement about all men but talking about her own reasons for not wanting a penis. So, maybe she's not being sexist. The boyfriend's initial comment was more of a dismissive remark about her period, which could be seen as invalidating her experience. So the author's response is addressing that by pointing out the other side, which might be a valid reaction. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
