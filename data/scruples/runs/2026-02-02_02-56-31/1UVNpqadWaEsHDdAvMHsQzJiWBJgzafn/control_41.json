Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't deal with periods and says \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because male genitals seem uncomfortable. She lists reasons like the need to constantly attend to them, like scratching or rearranging. He gets upset, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for expressing her preferences. Let me think about the dynamics here. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as dismissive of her experience with periods. Then he presses her about not wanting a penis. The author's response is about her personal discomfort with male anatomy. He reacts negatively, calling her sexist. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, expressing a personal preference isn't inherently sexist. She's stating her opinion based on her observations. However, the boyfriend's comment about trashing vaginas and periods might be problematic. The key here is whether her statement is sexist or not. \n\nSexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author isn't making a generalized negative statement about men or male anatomy as a whole. She's explaining her own personal discomfort, which is a valid perspective. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling criticized, but the author isn't making a broad judgment against all men. \n\nOn the other hand, could there be an element of sexism in her statement? Maybe if she were to generalize that all women feel the same or make a sweeping negative statement about men's bodies. But in this case, it's about her own feelings. So, she's not wrong for stating her own preferences. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his sensitivity to the topic rather than her being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the context matters. The boyfriend first made a comment trashing periods and vaginas, then the author responds to his jab. The fact that he's upset about her response while he made the initial negative comment could imply that he's not handling the conversation well. The author is just giving a honest answer to his question, which is her right. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's expressing her personal opinion without making a sexist generalization. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
