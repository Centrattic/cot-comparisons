  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, then saying something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals are uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect and understanding in a relationship. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of periods, which are a natural part of the user's experience. Then, when the user expresses her own discomfort with male anatomy, he takes offense and labels her as sexist. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend's comment about periods being a downside is problematic because it trivializes a real health issue many women face. Then, the user's response is a personal opinion based on her observations of his body maintenance. It's about expressing a personal preference, not making a blanket judgment against all men. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about defensiveness and feeling criticized rather than engaging in a constructive conversation. When he calls her sexist, it's a mischaracterization of her stance. Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender, but she's just sharing her personal perspective on anatomy. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their views without fear of being attacked. The user isn't attacking his masculinity; she's stating her own bodily preferences. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from a place of feeling insecure or misunderstood, but that doesn't mean the user was wrong to express her feelings. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for expressing her honest opinion. The issue here is more about the boyfriend's inability to handle criticism or differing viewpoints without taking it personally. The user's response is a valid expression of her comfort level with male anatomy, and the boyfriend's reaction is an overreaction fueled by defensiveness. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
