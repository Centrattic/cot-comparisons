Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded that she doesn't want male genitals because they're uncomfortable and awkward, and he got offended, calling her sexist. She's confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her period, which is a valid female experience. Then he made a joke about her wishing to have a penis. Her response is about her personal discomfort with male genitalia. She's pointing out things like having to deal with body parts that require constant attention, which she finds annoying. He got upset and called her sexist, which is confusing because he was criticizing her biology first.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she was responding to his comment. She's expressing her own feelings and observations. She didn't make a generalization about all men, just her own preferences. The boyfriend seems to have a double standard\u2014he criticized her for having a period, then got upset when she expressed discomfort with male anatomy. \n\nThe key points are mutual disrespect here. He made a joke that could be seen as minimizing her experience, and she's stating her perspective. She's not making a sexist statement; she's sharing her personal view. He's the one who started with a sexist comment about periods. Her response is about her own body and preferences, not a blanket statement against men. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and rooted in defensiveness. The user is asking for validation here, and the situation seems to highlight the boyfriend's inconsistency and lack of empathy. The author isn't wrong for expressing her feelings, especially in response to his initial remark.\n"
