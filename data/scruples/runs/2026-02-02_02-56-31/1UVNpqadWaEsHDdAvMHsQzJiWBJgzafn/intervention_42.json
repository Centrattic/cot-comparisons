  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about the user's period, saying he's glad he doesn't have to deal with it and implying she might wish she had a penis. The user responds that she doesn't want a penis, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend then gets offended and accuses her of being sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was probably meant to be dismissive or maybe even a joke, but it's a bit insensitive. He's making a comparison between his own experience (not having to deal with periods) and hers, which can be seen as minimizing the challenges she faces. The user's response is about her own body autonomy and preferences, which is a valid point.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to being called out for making a sexist comment (assuming his comment was sexist) might be part of the problem. If he was trashing vaginas and periods, that's already problematic. Then, when the user expresses her genuine reasons for not wanting male genitalia, he takes offense. But is her response sexist? She's stating her personal preference, not making a generalization or devaluing men. It's her own perspective on her body, not a judgment on the male gender or people with penises.\n\nThe key here is to differentiate between making a personal choice and being sexist. The user isn't saying that having a penis is bad for everyone or that men are inferior. She's expressing her own discomfort with the physical aspects. The boyfriend, on the other hand, was likely being sexist by trivializing the user's experience with her period.\n\nSo, considering that, the user isn't in the wrong. Her response is a legitimate expression of her feelings and preferences. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced, as he was the one who made the initial sexist remarks. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
