  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend that they don't want a penis. The situation involves a period comment from the boyfriend, which led to a discussion about not wanting to have a penis because of the discomfort and maintenance. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and implied she wishes she had a penis. The user's response was based on personal observation of male genital maintenance being uncomfortable. The boyfriend took offense, considering it sexist, but the user is confused because he was criticizing vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nThe key points here are mutual disrespect. The boyfriend started by dismissing the user's experience with periods, which is a valid and common female experience. The user then expressed her honest feelings about not wanting male genitalia, which the boyfriend took as sexist. However, since the boyfriend initiated the conversation with a derogatory remark about periods, the user's response might be a legitimate reaction to his comment. The boyfriend's offense seems disproportionate, especially since he first made a negative comparison. \n\nSexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The user's comment is more about personal preference based on observed discomfort rather than a generalization about all men or a derogatory statement about their gender. The boyfriend's reaction might be defensiveness rather than justified offense. Additionally, the user is pointing out the maintenance aspect, which is a factual observation rather than a sexist remark.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior in storming off after the user's honest answer suggests he might be more focused on defending his gender or his own feelings rather than engaging in a respectful dialogue. The user's stance is about her own preferences, not making a blanket statement about all men. Therefore, it's likely that the user is not in the wrong here. The boyfriend's initial comments set a disrespectful tone, and the user's response was a direct, honest reply to his provocations.\n"
