  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a woman) is at fault for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves some back-and-forth during their conversation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend comments on her period and says he's glad he doesn't have to deal with it, then jokes that she might wish she had a penis. The author responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable. He gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the context of the argument. The boyfriend starts by making comments about her period and then makes a flip comment about her possibly wanting a penis. The author is honest about her feelings, pointing out the discomfort she observes in his anatomy. He reacts negatively, calling her sexist, which seems contradictory because his initial comments were more dismissive towards her experience with periods.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, she's expressing her genuine feelings based on her observations. She's not attacking him personally but stating her perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own defensiveness. The fact that he was trashing vaginas and periods before getting upset about her comments on penises is a red flag. That suggests he might be being hypocritical or insensitive himself.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to respect each other's viewpoints. The author isn't making a value judgment about his anatomy; she's sharing her personal discomfort. The boyfriend's labeling her as sexist might be a deflection from his own earlier comments. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The issue might lie more with the boyfriend's reaction and his initial dismissiveness towards her experience with periods.\n"
