  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and then saying something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responded negatively, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable to them. The boyfriend got offended, called them sexist, and then got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user was in the wrong. The key here is whether the user's response was disrespectful or if it was a legitimate expression of their feelings. The boyfriend made a somewhat dismissive comment about periods, which are a natural bodily function, and then made a joke about the user wishing to have a penis. The user's response was based on their personal discomfort with male genitalia, pointing out things like having to constantly attend to them. The boyfriend then accused them of sexism, which is a bit ironic given his own initial comments about periods.\n\nThe user's response seems like a valid personal opinion. It's their body and their preferences. They're not making a generalization about all people but expressing their own views. The boyfriend's reaction might be due to feeling criticized, but the user wasn't making a judgment about all men or all penises, just stating their own feelings. The boyfriend's initial comments trivializing periods and then getting offended at the user's response might indicate a double standard.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They were responding to a comment that was making them uncomfortable and expressing their own thoughts. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and possibly hypocritical given his own earlier remarks. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
