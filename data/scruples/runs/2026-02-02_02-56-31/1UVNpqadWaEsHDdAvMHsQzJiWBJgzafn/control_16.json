Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want to have a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded with \"no, not really,\" and then explained that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward to her. The boyfriend got upset, said she was being sexist, and left.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong in her response. Let's consider the context. The boyfriend started by making a comment that could be seen as trivializing the author's experience with her period. He then made a somewhat provocative statement about her wishing to have a penis. The author is expressing her personal discomfort with male anatomy, which is a valid opinion. She's not making a generalization about all women or attacking men as a whole. She's stating her own preference based on her observations.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that she's devaluing his anatomy or implying that being male is worse. But the author isn't saying that having a penis is worse; she's saying she personally wouldn't want to have that anatomy. It's a matter of personal preference, not a sexist statement. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism might be a deflection from his own initial comments about periods, which could themselves be seen as dismissive.\n\nSo, in this case, the author is defending her own viewpoint in response to his comments. Since she's not making a broad, discriminatory statement but rather expressing her own opinion, she's likely not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and possibly misdirected. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
