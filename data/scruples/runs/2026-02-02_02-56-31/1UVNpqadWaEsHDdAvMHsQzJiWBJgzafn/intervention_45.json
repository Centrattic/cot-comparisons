Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. Let me break this down.\n\nThe boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responded \"no, not really.\" Then the boyfriend pressed for reasons, and the user explained finding male genitals uncomfortable and messy, leading to him getting offended and calling her sexist. He then left to let her think about why her comments upset him.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a dismissive and possibly condescending comment about periods, which is a sensitive topic. The user's response was a straightforward statement of her preference, not a direct insult. She gave her reasoning about discomfort, which is a valid personal opinion. The boyfriend reacting with anger and calling her sexist seems like an overreaction. Sexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender, but the user was expressing a personal preference, not making a judgment about the male gender as a whole.\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment was likely more sexist, as he was minimizing the experience of menstruation. The user's response was a personal choice statement, not a broad generalization. His reaction to her explanation suggests he took it as an attack on his body, which is a common defensiveness. However, the user's comments were based on her observations and preferences, which are reasonable. \n\nIn arguments like this, the context matters. The boyfriend started with a comment that trivialized periods, and the user's response was in self-expression. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced. So the user isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
