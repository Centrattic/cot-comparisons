  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation is a bit complex. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then joked about the user wishing they had a dick. The user responded negatively, explaining that having male genitalia would be uncomfortable for them. The boyfriend took offense, called them sexist, and got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of the user's experience with periods, which is a common source of sexism. He then made a joke that's a bit flip about the user's anatomy. The user's response was about their personal preferences and observations about male genitalia, which they find uncomfortable. The boyfriend reacted by taking offense, suggesting that the user is being sexist for not wanting a penis. \n\nThe key here is whether the user's statement is sexist. Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The user is expressing a personal preference and making an observation based on their experience. They're not making a broad statement about all men or women. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling criticized about his anatomy, but the user is not making a judgment about his gender as a whole. Instead, they're sharing their own perspective. \n\nIt's also important to note the context: the boyfriend had previously made a derogatory comment about vaginas and periods, which is clearly sexist. The user's response is in contrast, pointing out discomfort with male anatomy. The boyfriend's offense might be more about defensiveness over his own body rather than a valid sexist accusation. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user's response was honest and specific to their feelings. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he might be more focused on protecting his ego than engaging in a constructive conversation. The user isn't in the wrong for expressing their genuine feelings, especially after the boyfriend made a disparaging remark. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
