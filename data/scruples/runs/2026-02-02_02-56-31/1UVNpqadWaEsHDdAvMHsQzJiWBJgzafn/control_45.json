  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about not having to deal with periods and said something implying the author might wish she had a penis instead. She responds that she doesn't want a penis, finds male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calling her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a dismissive or trivializing remark about her period, which is a sensitive topic. His comment about her wishing she had a dick could be seen as belittling her experience. The author's response is about her personal preferences and observations about the discomfort of male genitalia. She points out that he himself deals with those issues, implying that he shouldn't be so negative about her situation.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's reaction seems to be that he's offended by her stating her opinion. But his initial comments were also critical of her body and experience. The author is responding to his sexist remarks with her own perspective. She's not attacking him personally, just expressing her viewpoint. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism might be a deflection or a misinterpretation of the conversation. \n\nFrom a social norms perspective, it's important to respect each other's experiences and not make others feel bad about their bodies. The author is standing up for herself against his negative comments, so she's not being sexist. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about being defensive rather than addressing the actual issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
