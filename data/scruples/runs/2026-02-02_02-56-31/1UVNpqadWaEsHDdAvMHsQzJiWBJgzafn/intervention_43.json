  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started when the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend then got offended, called her sexist, and left to cool off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the user was being sexist. The boyfriend made a comment that was dismissive of periods and vaginal biology, which isn't cool. The user's response was about her own preferences regarding having a penis. She's not making a judgment about his gender or his experience, just stating her own view. She even points out specific things he does, like scratching, which supports her perspective. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems a bit over the top. He called her sexist, but she's not making a broad, negative generalization about men. She's expressing a personal preference based on her observations. It's possible he felt criticized about his own body, which might have triggered a defensive reaction. \n\nFrom a social justice perspective, the boyfriend's initial comments about periods and the user's response don't necessarily show malintent. The user's stance is about her own preferences, not denigrating his anatomy. The boyfriend's taking offense might stem from feeling that his masculinity is under threat if his genitalia are criticized, but that's more about his reaction than her words.\n\nI think the key here is whether the user's comments were respectful and not intended to demean. She's not saying male anatomy is worse, just that she doesn't want it. The boyfriend's taking offense and calling her sexist is misplaced. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
