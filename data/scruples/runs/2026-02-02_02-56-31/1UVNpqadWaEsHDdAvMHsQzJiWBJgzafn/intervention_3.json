  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with her boyfriend making a comment about periods and then implying she wishes she had a penis. She responds by saying she doesn't like the idea of having male genitalia because it's uncomfortable and messy. He gets upset and calls her sexist, then storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, which is a bit dismissive. Then he makes a joke about her wishing she had a penis. She responds by explaining why she wouldn't want that, pointing out the discomfort and maintenance. He reacts negatively, comparing it to his own experiences with male genitalia.\n\nIs her response sexist? Well, she's expressing a personal preference based on her observations. She's not making a generalization about all men or all people with penises, but stating her own feelings. He's taking offense to her honest opinion, which might be an issue of differing perspectives. She's being honest about her experience, and he's getting defensive. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be seen as hypocritical, especially since he was trashing vaginas and periods before. Her response is about her body and how she perceives it, which is a valid personal opinion. There's no inherent sexism in her statement; she's not saying that having a penis is inferior, just that she doesn't want that anatomy for herself. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here. She's being honest, and his taking offense might stem from his own discomfort with criticism of male anatomy or a lack of understanding about personal preferences. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
