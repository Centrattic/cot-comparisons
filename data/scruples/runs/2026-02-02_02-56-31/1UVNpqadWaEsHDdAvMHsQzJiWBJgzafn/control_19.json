Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a conversation between a girlfriend and boyfriend where the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and then the author says she doesn't want a penis, explaining that having male genitals seems uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist, then storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend initially made a flippant comment about not having to deal with periods, which can be a sensitive topic. The author's response is about her personal preference regarding anatomy, pointing out discomfort with male genitalia. She's not making a blanket statement about all men or all penises, but rather expressing her own feelings based on observing her partner's habits.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to label her as sexist. Sexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. Here, the author is talking about her physical preferences, not making a judgment about the worth or capabilities of men versus women. It's more of a personal preference rather than a sexist statement. However, the boyfriend might feel that her comment is dismissive of his anatomy, but that's not the same as sexism.\n\nAnother angle is the comparison between their complaints. The author mentions that he trashes vaginas and periods, then gets upset when she expresses her discomfort with his anatomy. That seems like a double standard. If he's criticizing her for having a vagina and periods, she's pointing out that his anatomy isn't perfect either. So she's not in the wrong for pointing out that both have their own issues.\n\nAlso, when someone says they don't want a certain body part, especially in the context of a relationship discussion about anatomy, it's their right to express that. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling that his anatomy is being criticized, but he initiated the conversation with a comment about her anatomy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author was responding to his comment with her own perspective, which is valid. The boyfriend's reaction seems over the top and possibly hypocritical given his earlier remarks. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
