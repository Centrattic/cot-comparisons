  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation where the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said she might wish she had a dick. The author responds that she doesn't want a penis, finding male genitals uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend gets offended, calling her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her period and perhaps mocking her gender experience. The author's response is about her personal preferences regarding anatomy. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate, as he's upset about her honesty about her preferences. The question is whether the author is wrong for expressing her views.\n\nConsider the dynamics of the argument. The boyfriend's comment was likely a jab at her experience, and her response is a factual expression of her discomfort with male anatomy. He accuses her of sexism, which might be a form of gaslighting or deflecting his initial dismissive remarks. The author isn't criticizing all men but her own anatomy preferences. So, she's stating her opinion, not making a blanket statement against men. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her personal views.\n"
