  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, then saying \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend got offended and accused her of sexism, then left to think about it. The user is confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the user was wrong. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of female biology (periods) and then suggested having a penis would be better. The user's response was honest about her discomfort with male genitalia. She pointed out the practical issues like having to constantly adjust them. The boyfriend's reaction was to accuse her of sexism, which is a bit of a deflection. He was making negative comments about female anatomy first, then took offense when she didn't want his anatomy.\n\nThe key points here are mutual disrespect. The boyfriend trivialized a female biological function (periods) and made a comment implying that having a penis is better. The user's response was about her personal preference and discomfort, which is valid. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism might be a way to shut down the conversation rather than address his own comments. His reaction seems more about being offended than understanding her perspective. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider if the user crossed a line. She made a personal preference statement, not an attack. She didn't make a blanket statement about all men or their bodies, just her own view. The boyfriend's comments were more derogatory towards women's bodies. So in this context, the user isn't in the wrong for expressing her honest feelings. The boyfriend's reaction was disproportionate and possibly deflective. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
