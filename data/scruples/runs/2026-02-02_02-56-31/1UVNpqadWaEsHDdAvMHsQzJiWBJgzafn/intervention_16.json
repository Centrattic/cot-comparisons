Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable to her. He got offended, called her sexist, and left. She's confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key elements here. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment about periods, which is a common issue women face. Then he made a flip comment about wishing she had a penis. She's honest about her feelings, pointing out the physical aspects she finds inconvenient. He takes offense, labels her as sexist, and storms off. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she's expressing her personal preferences. She's not making a blanket statement about all people but sharing her specific reasons. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. His initial comments about periods being a problem and implying that having a vagina is a downside might be more problematic. He then gets upset when she points out the other side of the coin. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. From a communication standpoint, she's being honest about her feelings. He's reacting defensively. Sexism usually involves prejudice or stereotyping. She's not making a generalization about all women not wanting penises; she's talking about her own perspective. His reaction seems to be about being criticized for his own comments rather than her stance. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial comments could be considered sexist, as he's minimizing the challenges women face. Her pointing out the other side might be balanced, but he's focusing on her comment about not wanting a penis, not his earlier remarks. \n\nSo, probably the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. He's being hypocritical and taking offense where she's just stating her opinion. However, it's a personal relationship issue, and both could have handled it better. But in terms of right or wrong, she's justified in her stance.\n"
