  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, then implying the user might wish she had a penis. She responds that male genitalia seem uncomfortable, and he gets offended, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her period, which is a valid female experience. His remark about her wishing she had a dick seems like a backhanded compliment or a way to minimize her discomfort. Then the user explains her reasons for not wanting a penis, pointing out the maintenance involved, like scratching or adjusting. He reacts strongly, getting upset and leaving.\n\nThe user is confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay. The key issue here is mutual respect. The boyfriend's initial comments were probably hurtful, and his reaction to her honest feedback suggests he's not open to discussing differences in anatomy without taking it personally. The user isn't wrong for expressing her genuine feelings about male genitalia, especially since his comments were disrespectful. She's responding to his remarks with her own perspective. The boyfriend's offense might stem from defensiveness rather than understanding. So, the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
