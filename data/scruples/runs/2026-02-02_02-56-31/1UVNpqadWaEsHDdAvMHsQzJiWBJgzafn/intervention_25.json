  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, then saying something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responds that they don't, explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable. The boyfriend then gets offended, calling her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user did something wrong. Let's break down the key points. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as devaluing female biology (periods) and implying that having a penis is better. The user's response is a straightforward statement of her preference, based on her observations of his body maintenance. She's expressing her view without forcing him to agree. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to label her as sexist, which might be a deflection. The user isn't making a generalization about all women but is stating her own opinion. The boyfriend's initial comments about periods might be more problematic. It's possible he was being dismissive of her experience, then got upset when she pointed out the downsides of male anatomy. \n\nIn terms of communication, the user is being honest about her feelings. Unless she was making a derogatory comment, she's within her rights to express her perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate, especially since he initiated the conversation with a negative remark. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for stating her opinion. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
