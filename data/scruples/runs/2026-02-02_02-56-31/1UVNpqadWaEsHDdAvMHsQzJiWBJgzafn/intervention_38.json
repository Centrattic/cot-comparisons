  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about not dealing with periods and implying the user might wish to have a penis instead. The user responded by saying no, finding male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nSo, the key points here are the boyfriend's initial comment and the user's response. The boyfriend made a dismissive remark about periods and suggested the user would prefer being male. That's already a bit problematic because it's minimizing her experience. Then, the user's response is about her personal discomfort with male genitalia, which is a valid opinion. She's not attacking him personally but expressing her own feelings. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems out of proportion. He's offended and calls her sexist, which might not be accurate. The user isn't making a general statement against all men or their bodies; she's sharing her personal perspective. His comparison to his own grooming habits (scratching his nuts, etc.) is a bit of a double standard because he was first trashing her experience with periods. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user's response is a legitimate expression of her opinion. There's no inherent wrong in expressing discomfort with someone's anatomy unless it's done in a discriminatory or disrespectful way. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from defensiveness rather than a healthy discussion. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. The issue is more about the boyfriend's inability to handle differing opinions and his initial dismissive comment. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
