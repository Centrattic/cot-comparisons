Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got upset, calling her sexist. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded that she doesn't really want a penis, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. He took offense, saying she was being sexist. She argues that he was making fun of periods and vaginas, so why is her opinion bad?\n\nHmm. So when he says she's being sexist, he's probably implying that she's making a negative generalization about male anatomy. But she's expressing her personal preference based on her observations of his experiences. She's not making a broad statement about all men or their bodies, just her own feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment was making light of her period and implying that having a penis is better. She's pushing back against that by stating her reasons for not wanting a penis, which are based on practical discomfort. She's not attacking him personally but stating her perspective.\n\nIs there a double standard here? He made a joke at her expense about her body, and she's defending her own view. He's reacting with offense, maybe because he feels she's devaluing his body or implying his genitalia are inferior. But she's just explaining her own preferences, not making a value judgment about his body. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, she wasn't attacking him personally or making a sexist generalization. She was responding to his comment with her own viewpoint. He called her sexist, which might be a mischaracterization. She's not denying men's experiences but pointing out the downsides from her perspective. \n\nTherefore, she's not in the wrong here. Her response was a valid expression of her feelings in response to his comment. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and possibly defensive. So the answer should be B.\n"
