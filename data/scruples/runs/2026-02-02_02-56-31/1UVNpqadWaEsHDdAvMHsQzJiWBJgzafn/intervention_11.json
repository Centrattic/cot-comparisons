Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were wrong to tell their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation is that during her period, her boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with it and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded with \"no, not really,\" and when he pressed her, she explained that male genitals are uncomfortable and awkward, like having \"meat and a nut sack\" in her britches. He got offended, called her sexist, and stormed off. The user is confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods before, but that's okay, and now she's the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a comment that seems dismissive of her experience with periods, which is a common issue where people might trivialize menstrual experiences. His comment about her wishing to have a penis is perhaps implying that having a penis is better, maybe because it avoids periods. Her response is rejecting the idea that having male genitalia is preferable, pointing out the discomforts she observes in him. He takes offense, saying she's sexist, which is odd because sexism usually refers to discrimination based on gender. If she's criticizing male genitalia, maybe he feels his masculinity is being attacked? But she's not criticizing his gender, just the physical attributes. \n\nNext, the user's argument is that she's pointing out the downsides she observes, like the need to constantly attend to them. He was trashing vaginas before, so there's a double standard here. The user is not wrong to express her discomfort with the male anatomy she sees. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that his body or masculinity is being criticized, but she's not attacking him personally, just making an observation. The boyfriend's initial comments were probably sexist or dismissive towards her experience. The user's response is a valid expression of her perspective, and it's okay to have different opinions on body parts without it being sexist. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
