Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the user's period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responded with \"no, not really,\" and elaborated that having male genitals seems uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and left angry.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was probably dismissive or minimizing about periods, which are a natural part of life. His remark about the user wishing to have a penis could be seen as a form of sexism, implying that dealing with periods is worse than not having a penis. The user's response is a valid counterpoint, pointing out the discomforts of male anatomy that she observes in her boyfriend. \n\nThe boyfriend being upset and calling her sexist seems contradictory. If he was criticizing her for something related to her gender, then he might be projecting or not acknowledging his own sexist behavior. The user's reasoning is based on her observations of his actions, which is a reasonable perspective. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user was in the wrong. She was responding to his comment, which might have been sexist. Her response is a critique of male anatomy discomforts, which could be a form of pointing out the hypocrisy or the double standards in his argument. If his initial comment was meant to mock or belittle her experience, her response is a valid defense. \n\nHowever, the user's answer could be seen as a generalization if she's making broad statements about male anatomy. But since she's basing her comments on her observations of her boyfriend's specific behaviors, it's more of a personal opinion. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling criticized or attacked, even if her comments were a direct response to his. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider mutual respect in a conversation. The user had the right to express her feelings in response to his comment. Her boyfriend's offense might be misplaced, especially if his initial comment was the more problematic one. \n\nTherefore, the user is not in the wrong. She's responding to a potentially sexist remark with her own perspective, based on her observations. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be an overreaction, especially since he was the one who initiated the argument with a dismissive comment about periods. So, the answer should be B (No, she is not in the wrong).\n"
