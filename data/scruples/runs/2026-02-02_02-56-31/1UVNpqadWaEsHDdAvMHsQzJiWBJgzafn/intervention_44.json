  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation involves a period-related comment from the boyfriend, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a joke about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and implied the user might wish for a penis. The user responded that they don't want a penis, finding male genitals uncomfortable and inconvenient. The boyfriend took offense, calling the user sexist, and left in anger.\n\nI need to assess whether the user's response was inappropriate. The user's main points are about discomfort with male genitalia, citing practical issues like needing to scratch or adjust them. The boyfriend's reaction was to label the user as sexist, which might be a misinterpretation of the user's intent. \n\nSexism usually involves prejudice based on gender. The user is expressing a personal preference and observation, not making a generalized negative statement about men. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of periods and implied that having a penis is better, which could be seen as trivializing the user's experience. \n\nThe user's response was a direct but honest reaction to his comment. They focused on their own body's comfort, not making broader judgments about gender roles. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling attacked personally, but the user's comments were about their own perspective, not a sexist attack on him as a man. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's comparison of trashing vaginas and periods versus the user's comment on penises seems inconsistent. If he was okay with making negative remarks about female anatomy, the user's response shouldn't be considered sexist just because it's about male anatomy. \n\nSo, the user is expressing a personal viewpoint based on their observations and comfort. The boyfriend's reaction seems out of proportion and possibly deflecting his own initial dismissive remark. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
