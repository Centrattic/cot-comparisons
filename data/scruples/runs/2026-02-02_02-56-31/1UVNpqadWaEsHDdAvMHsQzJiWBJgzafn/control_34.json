Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when she told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds she doesn't want that, explaining it's uncomfortable. He gets offended, calls her sexist, and leaves. The author thinks it's weird because he was trashing vaginas before.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about mutual respect in a relationship. The boyfriend made a joke or comment that could be seen as dismissive of the author's experience with periods. Then when she responds with her honest feelings about male anatomy, he accuses her of sexism. \n\nI need to consider if the author was wrong to express her discomfort. People have different preferences, and expressing that you don't want a certain body part isn't inherently sexist. It's about personal opinion. However, maybe the way she expressed it was harsh? But she was responding to his comment.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. If he was making fun of her period, then getting upset when she critiques male anatomy could be double standard. He might be projecting or not taking responsibility for his initial comment.\n\nSo, the author's stance is based on her own observations and feelings. She's not making a generalization about all men, just stating her personal view. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism might be invalid here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her discomfort.\n"
