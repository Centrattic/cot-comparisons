  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded saying no, and explained that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended, called her sexist, and left to think about why she was upsetting him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her response was inappropriate. She's expressing her personal opinion about not wanting male genitalia. She's not making a blanket statement about all people or attacking his identity. She even points out the discomfort and maintenance aspects, like scratching or adjusting. The boyfriend was making a joke about periods, which he later dismissed by comparing it to not having to deal with menstruation. His comment about her wishing she had a penis seems to be part of that back-and-forth banter. She replied honestly, explaining her reasons, which are based on her observations of his own behavior. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling disrespected or perhaps having his masculinity challenged. However, her statement is about her personal preference, not a criticism of him. He called her sexist, but that might be a deflecting accusation. Sexism would involve prejudice or discrimination based on gender, but she's just stating her opinion without making a generalized negative statement about men or their anatomy. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment about periods might be considered dismissive or trivializing, especially if he's minimizing her experience. Her response is a direct and honest reaction to his comment. The key here is whether her response crossed a line. Since she's not attacking him personally or making a broad statement about his gender, it seems her response was within the bounds of a personal opinion.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction of storming off might be more about his own feelings of being criticized rather than her actually being wrong. The situation seems to be more about differing perspectives and sensitivity. In healthy communication, both sides should be able to express their views without taking it personally. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Her response was a valid expression of her feelings about her anatomy preferences, and the boyfriend's offense might be misplaced. The answer should be B (No).\n"
