  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation is that during her period, her boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended, called her sexist, and stormed off. She's confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her response was appropriate. She's stating her honest feelings about not wanting male genitalia, based on observations of his behavior. She's pointing out aspects she finds inconvenient or uncomfortable. He took offense and accused her of sexism, which might be a misinterpretation. Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. Here, she's making a personal preference, not making a sweeping judgment about all men or women. \n\nHe made a dismissive comment about her period, which is a sensitive topic. Her response was a straightforward answer to his question. He might be projecting his own comments back at her, thinking she's being sexist when he was making a derogatory remark about her anatomy. \n\nThe key points are mutual disrespect here. He made a comment that trivialized her experience with periods, and she responded by stating her views on male anatomy. He took offense, but his initial remark wasn't respectful either. \n\nIs she in the wrong? She's expressing her genuine feelings without attacking his gender as a whole. She's not making a generalization but a personal choice. He's reacting as if her opinion is an attack on his masculinity, which might be his own issue. \n\nSo the answer is B, No, she's not in the wrong. Both had issues with respect, but her response was a valid personal opinion.\n"
