Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conversation between the author and her boyfriend about not wanting to have a penis.\n\nFirst, I need to break down what happened. The boyfriend made a comment during her period, saying he's glad he doesn't have to deal with that and added, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that she finds male genitals uncomfortable and awkward. She mentions things like the penis and scrotum being in the pants, which she finds inconvenient. The boyfriend took offense, called her sexist, and got mad. The author is confused because her boyfriend had previously made negative comments about periods and vaginas but she's the one being called out.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are whether her comments were sexist or if she's justified in her response. The boyfriend made a sarcastic comment implying that having a vagina is worse because of periods, and the author is pointing out the downsides of having a penis. She's making a valid observation based on her perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems hypersensitive because he's being told that his body has aspects that can be inconvenient, which contrasts with his earlier dismissal of her experiences. \n\nSexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author isn't making a generalization that all men are uncomfortable, but rather sharing her personal view. Her boyfriend's offense might be misplaced here. He was the one who initiated the conversation with a condescending remark, so the author is responding to his comment. She's not making a sexist statement; she's expressing her personal preference, which is a reasonable reaction to his provocative statement. \n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's previous comments about periods and vaginas being negative could imply he has his own biases. The author is essentially highlighting the flip side of his argument. If he finds periods burdensome, she's pointing out that the male anatomy has its own issues. This seems like a balanced response rather than an offensive one. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Her boyfriend's reaction is based on his own discomfort with being critiqued about his gender's anatomy, especially after he himself made a derogatory comment. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
