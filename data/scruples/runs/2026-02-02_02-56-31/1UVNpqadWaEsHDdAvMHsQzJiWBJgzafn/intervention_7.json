  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. The situation involves a boyfriend commenting on the user's period and then making a joke about her not wishing to have a penis. The user responds by saying she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward, leading to the boyfriend feeling offended and calling her sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend made a comment implying that having a penis would be better to avoid periods, which the user disagreed with. She then explained her reasons, which the boyfriend took as sexist. The user is questioning if she's wrong for expressing her discomfort with male anatomy.\n\nLooking at the boyfriend's initial comment: he's dismissing the female experience by saying he's glad he doesn't have to deal with periods. Then he jokes about the user wishing to have a penis. That's already a problematic statement, as it's minimizing the challenges of being a woman (periods, etc.) and suggesting that having a penis is better. The user's response is pointing out the discomfort and maintenance of male genitalia, which is a valid observation.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist is confusing. He was the one making gendered comments that were dismissive of her experience. By bringing up the idea that he doesn't have to deal with periods, he's essentially valuing the male experience as better in that aspect. The user's response is pointing out the other side of the coin\u2014different challenges associated with male anatomy. It's a matter of perspective. \n\nSexism often involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The boyfriend's initial comments were sexist because they were devaluing the female experience. The user's comments, while pointing out the discomforts of male anatomy, aren't necessarily sexist. She's not making a generalization that one gender is superior, just stating her observations. Her comment about scratching and adjusting genitals is based on her observations of her partner's behavior, which is a personal opinion rather than a broad sexist statement.\n\nThe boyfriend's offense seems misplaced. He was the one making the initial sexist remark, yet he's upset when she counters with her perspective. The user isn't in the wrong for expressing her discomfort with a body type she doesn't have. It's similar to saying that different bodies come with different challenges, and she's highlighting a downside of male anatomy that he might not be considering.\n\nTherefore, the boyfriend's reaction is more about being defensive about his initial comment rather than the user being sexist. The user's response is a valid counterpoint to his initial sexist remark. So, the answer should be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
