Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend makes a comment about not having to deal with periods, implying maybe the author would wish for a penis. She responds that she doesn't want a penis because it's uncomfortable and messy, referencing things like scratching and rearranging. He gets offended, calls her sexist, and leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze whether the author's response is appropriate. The boyfriend's initial comment could be seen as dismissive or making light of her experience with periods. When she responds by expressing her own discomfort with male genitalia, is that sexist? Or is she just sharing her honest perspective?\n\nThe key here is whether her comments are discriminatory. She's stating her personal preferences based on her observations. She's not making a blanket statement about all men or their genitalia, just her own feelings. The boyfriend, on the other hand, made a comment that could be seen as trivializing her experience. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist might be a deflection. He was initially trashing periods and vaginas, and her response was a counter about the male experience. It seems like a mutual exchange of complaints, but he took offense. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's response was honest but perhaps could have been phrased differently. However, the core issue is that the boyfriend was making a dismissive comment, and she was pointing out her own discomfort. Neither is entirely without fault, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that she's expressing her genuine feelings and the boyfriend was the one who started with a potentially offensive remark, it's more likely that the boyfriend's reaction is misplaced. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
