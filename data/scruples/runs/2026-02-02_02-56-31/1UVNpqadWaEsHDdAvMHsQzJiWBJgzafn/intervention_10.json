Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about mutual respect and how each person perceives the other's comments. The boyfriend's initial remarks were probably dismissive of the challenges of having a period. Then he's suggesting the user might wish to have a penis, which could be seen as minimizing her experience. The user's response is about her own feelings and observations about male anatomy, which she finds uncomfortable. \n\nThe boyfriend's getting upset and calling her sexist is a bit confusing. If the user is stating her own perspective without attacking him, maybe his reaction is over the top. However, using terms like \"nuts\" or \"junk\" might be seen as dismissive, but the user is just expressing her viewpoint. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both sides can express their feelings without being defensive. The boyfriend's initial comments were probably not respectful, and the user's response was a valid expression of her feelings. The boyfriend's reaction to her being sexist seems like a misinterpretation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user is not in the wrong. They were responding to his comments and expressing their own perspective. The boyfriend's behavior, on the other hand, was dismissive and reactive. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
