  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period and implying she might wish she had a penis. She responded that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and messy. He got offended, called her sexist, and stormed off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her response was appropriate. She's expressing her honest opinion based on her observations of his habits, like scratching or adjusting his genitals. She's not attacking him personally but making a general statement about anatomy. His reaction seems to be about feeling disrespected or being labeled as sexist. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, when someone makes a derogatory comment about another's body, it's reasonable to push back. However, she might have come across as dismissive or disrespectful in her phrasing. But given the context, she's stating her perspective without attacking him personally. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from defensiveness, especially since he first criticized her period. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect in communication. She's defending her view, which is within her rights. He might have overreacted by taking it as sexism instead of a personal preference. So, the answer likely is B (she's not in the wrong), but there's room for better communication from both sides. She could have phrased it more gently, and he should handle criticism without becoming defensive.\n"
