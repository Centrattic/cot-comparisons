I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist who got arrested. The situation involves a confrontation where Karen, a protestor, approached the user while they were walking their dog. The user mentions that Karen asked about the dog's breed, discussed dog overpopulation in shelters, and then escalated by grabbing the leash and trying to take the dog. The police were called, Karen was arrested, and now the user is facing a court date.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If Karen physically assaulted the user by grabbing the leash, pushing them, and trying to take the dog, that could be considered assault or battery, which are criminal offenses. The user's self-defense in trying to regain control of the leash and getting help from a neighbor seems justified. The police revoked the protestor's permit because of her actions, which might indicate that her behavior wasn't protected under free speech since it involved physical aggression.\n\nHowever, the user's initial response to Karen's questioning is important. The user was approached and engaged in conversation. The user didn't provoke the confrontation, but they might have felt defensive when questioned about their breeder choice. The user's decision to report Karen to the police after an assault is a standard response. They might have a valid case for self-defense or protection of their pet.\n\nOn the other hand, if the police are now charging the user with a felony, that complicates things. The user mentions facing a felony fifth degree charge. Felony charges are serious and would require legal representation. The user should consult with an attorney to understand their rights and the evidence against them. The fact that the user reported the incident and the police arrested Karen initially suggests that the police saw Karen's actions as criminal. However, if the user escalated the situation by reporting it, there might be a legal battle over who was at fault.\n\nThe user's argument is that Karen's actions were unprovoked and aggressive. The user's response was to protect themselves and the dog, which is a reasonable reaction. The user might have a defense based on self-defense or protection of property (the dog). However, the felony charge against them is concerning. The user might need to present evidence, like the neighbor's testimony, to support their side of the story.\n\nIn terms of morality, the user might feel conflicted about reporting someone for their beliefs, even if the actions were aggressive. But the key point is that Karen's actions crossed into criminal behavior beyond protest or free speech. The user acting in self-defense is generally seen as justified. However, the legal system might have different standards, especially if the user's actions in reporting led to a felony charge for them. This part is unclear, so consulting a lawyer is crucial.\n\nIn summary, the user's actions in self-defense and reporting a criminal act might not make them at fault. However, the legal outcome depends on the specifics of the case, evidence, and how the court interprets the events. The user might not be in the wrong, but they should prepare for legal proceedings with proper representation.\n"
