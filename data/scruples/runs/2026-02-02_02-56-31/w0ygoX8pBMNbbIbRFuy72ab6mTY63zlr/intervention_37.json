I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist who was arrested. The incident happened when Karen, a protestor, approached the user while they were walking their dog. The conversation escalated when Karen accused the user of being selfish for buying a purebred dog from a breeder instead of adopting. Karen then grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the user, and tried to take the dog, leading to her arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user was the victim of physical assault when Karen pushed them and tried to take the dog. Assault is a criminal offense, so reporting it is justified. The user didn't provoke the situation; they were walking their dog and responding to Karen's questions. The police involved themselves after the incident, which suggests they saw Karen's actions as criminal.\n\nNext, the user mentions feeling conflicted about the protest. They acknowledge that other protestors were exercising their free speech, which is valid. However, Karen's actions went beyond peaceful protest into physical aggression, which is illegal. Free speech doesn't protect illegal acts. So, the user reported a criminal act, not the protest itself.\n\nThe user also felt bad about the other protestors, but they didn't interfere with their activities. The issue was Karen's individual behavior. The user didn't target the protest or the group, just the person who attacked them.\n\nEmotionally, the user is torn because Karen was passionate about her cause, but that doesn't excuse assault. The user acted in self-defense by retrieving their dog and seeking police help. The outcome (Karen facing charges) is a result of her actions, not the user's intent to target the protest.\n\nThere's a possibility that the user's initial interaction with Karen might have been misinterpreted, but the key point is the physical attack. The user didn't instigate the aggression; they were reacting to it. The police's decision to revoke the protest permit might have been due to Karen's actions violating the terms of the permit, not the user's report.\n\nConsidering all factors, the user reported a criminal act of assault. Their actions were in response to being attacked and trying to protect their dog. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
