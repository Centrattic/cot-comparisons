I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The story is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) perspective.\n\nFirst, the incident: Karen approached the person while they were walking their dog. She started a conversation, then escalated by making a comment about dog shelters. The person explained their breeder choice, and Karen got aggressive, called them names, tried to take the dog's leash, pushed them. The person then reported her, leading to an arrest.\n\nThe key points here are the act of reporting. The person had a valid reason to report the assault (pushing, grabbing the leash, trying to take the dog). The police were involved, and Karen was arrested. The person also mentions they felt bad about the protest's permit being revoked because others were peaceful. \n\nIs the person in the wrong for reporting? Well, they were a victim of assault during the protest. Reporting a crime is a citizen's duty. Even if others were peacefully protesting, Karen's actions were separate. The person didn't escalate beyond reporting what happened. They didn't provoke her; they were just walking their dog. The police handled the arrest, and the person is now facing a court case. \n\nSo, the person acted within their rights to report the assault. They didn't instigate the situation. The answer would likely be B (No), they aren't in the wrong.\n"
