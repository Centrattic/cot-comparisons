I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, which led to her arrest and potential felony charges. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person was walking their dog when a woman (Karen) approached them. The woman then accused them of being part of the problem with breeders, called them names, grabbed the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The police arrested her, and the author is now facing a court date with potential charges.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author acted appropriately by reporting the incident. Let's break it down. \n\nThe woman's actions seem to go beyond peaceful protest. She physically grabbed the dog's leash and pushed the owner, which is an assault. The author was defending their dog and themselves. In that case, reporting a crime is justified. The police arrested her, which suggests they found the behavior to be criminal.\n\nHowever, the author might be concerned about whether they overreacted. The woman was part of a protest, but that doesn't excuse criminal behavior. Free speech doesn't cover assault. The author didn't instigate the conflict; they were just walking their dog. The woman escalated the situation by following them, yelling, and using force. \n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling torn because the other protesters were peaceful. They didn't target the entire group, just the individual who committed a crime. Reporting a crime isn't wrong, even if the person is part of a group with opposing views. \n\nThe potential felony charge against Karen is because she committed a physical assault. The author's action was to protect their dog and themselves. The court will decide if the charges are valid, but the initial report by the author was a response to a crime. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. The woman's actions crossed legal boundaries, and the author had the right to seek help from the police. The fact that the author feels some guilt about the broader protest group is understandable but doesn't make their action wrong.\n"
