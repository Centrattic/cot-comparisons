I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was walking their dog and had a confrontation with a protester from DxE. The activist, Karen, asked about the dog, then started pushing the author and trying to take the dog. The author reported her, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the interaction between the author and Karen. The author mentions that Karen approached, asked about the dog, then started making comments about shelter dogs and criticized the author's choice of a breeder. The author tried to walk away but Karen followed, got aggressive, called them names, and physically tried to take the dog. The author then reported the incident to the police, and Karen was arrested.\n\nLegally, if Karen physically assaulted the author or tried to take the dog, the author has the right to report that. The police's decision to revoke the protestor permit suggests that Karen's actions went beyond peaceful protest, possibly involving disorderly conduct or assault. The author's action of reporting was based on an assault, which is a legitimate reason.\n\nEthically, the author might feel conflicted because they understand the activist's stance but felt threatened. The author tried to de-escalate by walking away but was followed and attacked. In this case, self-defense and protecting one's pet are valid concerns. The fact that a neighbor witnessed the incident supports the author's account.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue if the author's initial response was to escalate the situation. But according to the story, the author was walking away and only reported after being attacked. The police's action indicates they found the report credible.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted in self-defense and reported a criminal act. The answer should be B (No).\n"
