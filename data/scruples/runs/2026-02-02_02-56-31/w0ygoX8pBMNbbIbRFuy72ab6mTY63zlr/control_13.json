I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist, leading to her arrest and facing a felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog when a woman from a protest group approached them. The woman asked about the dog, and when the author mentioned getting it from a breeder, the woman started to criticize them, called them names, and then tried to grab the dog. The author called the police, and the woman was arrested. Now the author is facing a felony charge and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the woman's actions. She followed the author, called them names, and physically tried to take the dog, which led to the police involvement. The author's actions were in response to an assault. Reporting an assault is generally within one's rights. However, the author might be in the wrong if their initial interaction wasn't a legitimate reason for police involvement. But in this case, the woman pushed the author and tried to take the dog, which is an assault. \n\nThe author might be worried that they were involved in a dispute with a protestor and that reporting her could affect free speech. However, the woman was acting aggressively and committing an assault, which is a criminal act. The protestors' rights don't protect against criminal behavior. \n\nThe author's actions were to protect themselves and their dog. They had a witness (the neighbor) and reported the incident. The police arrested the woman, which is appropriate. The author might have a case here, but they need to ensure their own conduct was within the law. They didn't start the conflict; the woman did. \n\nBut maybe the author is in the wrong if they provoked the woman by discussing their dog breeder choice. However, the woman's response escalated it. The author was just walking their dog, and the woman approached them. The author had the right to defend themselves. \n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, the woman's actions were the main issue. The author reporting her was a legitimate response. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
