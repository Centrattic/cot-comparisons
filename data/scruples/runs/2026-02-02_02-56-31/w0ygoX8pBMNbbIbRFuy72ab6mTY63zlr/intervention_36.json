I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user was walking their dog when a vegan activist (Karen) approached them. There's some interaction where Karen accuses the user of being selfish for getting a purebred dog from a breeder instead of adopting. Then Karen gets aggressive, grabs the dog's leash, pushes the user, and tries to take the dog. The user reports her, she gets arrested, and now the user is facing a court date where they might have to pay a fine related to the dog's cost.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. Karen's actions seem to be the direct cause of the arrest. She approached the user, had a conversation, then escalated to physical aggression. Grabbing the leash and pushing someone would likely be considered assault or battery, which is a criminal offense. The user's response was to involve the police, which is a reasonable action when someone is being physically aggressive.\n\nThe user mentions that they felt uncomfortable and tried to walk away, but Karen followed and escalated. The user didn't initiate any aggression. The neighbor witnessed the incident and helped, which supports the user's account. The police arrested Karen, which indicates they saw her actions as criminal.\n\nNow, the user is being charged with a felony, possibly related to the cost of the dog. Wait, the user says they bought the dog for $2500 and that Karen might face a fifth-degree felony with a fine up to $2500. That part is confusing. If the user is facing a charge because they reported Karen, but the charge is related to the dog's cost, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The user might be confused about the legal charges. Typically, assault charges are separate from property damage. If Karen tried to take the dog, maybe there's a theft or attempted theft charge, but the user's own charge being a felony for reporting her doesn't make sense unless there's a different legal context, like if the user used excessive force or something else. But according to the story, the user didn't use force beyond what's necessary to reclaim their dog's leash. The police arrested Karen, so the user's actions led to a valid arrest.\n\nThe user is now facing a court date where they might have to pay a fine up to $2500, which seems to be related to the dog's value. Maybe the charge is related to the incident causing the dog to be at risk, or perhaps the user is being charged with something else. But the user is confused about whether they are in the wrong. The main question is whether the user did something wrong by reporting Karen.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if Karen committed a crime (assault, battery, attempted theft), the user has every right to report her. The user didn't provoke her beyond their own reasonable response. Karen's actions were the problem. The user didn't use violence, just tried to protect their dog and themselves. The police's decision to revoke the protest permit because Karen was part of DxE might be a separate issue, but the user isn't responsible for the other protesters' activities. The user's intent was to stop an immediate threat to their dog and person.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong for reporting a criminal act. The charges against Karen are justified based on her actions. The user might be confused about their own charges, but the act of reporting a violent incident is not wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
