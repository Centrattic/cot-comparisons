I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge. The situation involves a conflict during a protest where the activist, Karen, confronted the author about their dog ownership. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was walking their dog when Karen, part of a protest group, approached. The conversation started about the dog's breed, then escalated into an argument about animal ethics. Karen tried to grab the dog's leash, pushed the author, and was arrested. The author then reported her, leading to legal consequences.\n\nNow, the key points here are the use of force by Karen. Grabbing the leash and pushing someone could be considered assault, which is a criminal act. The author acted in self-defense by trying to protect their dog and themselves. Reporting a crime to the police is generally a right. However, the question is whether the author overstepped by involving the police when it might have been a conflict that could have been resolved without legal action.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author claims they were defending themselves when Karen tried to take the dog. If Karen's actions were indeed aggressive and unlawful, then reporting her is justified. However, if the conflict was a misunderstanding or a result of strong opinions, the author's decision to involve the police might be seen as excessive. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they felt bad about the other protesters being affected by the revoked permit. That shows some consideration for free speech, but they still proceeded because Karen's actions were violent. The author's intention was to protect themselves and their dog, which is a valid reason. \n\nThe potential felony charge against Karen for fifth degree might depend on the jurisdiction's laws regarding assault or disorderly conduct. If Karen's actions meet the legal threshold for a felony, then the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they provoked the confrontation. But in this case, the author was just walking their dog when Karen approached. The escalation was due to Karen's aggressive behavior. The author tried to walk away but Karen continued to follow and escalate the situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were in response to an actual assault. The police involvement was appropriate because there was a physical altercation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
