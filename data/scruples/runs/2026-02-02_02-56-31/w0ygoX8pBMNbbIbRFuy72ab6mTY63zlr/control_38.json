I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves an argument escalating into a physical altercation where the activist grabbed the dog's leash and pushed the owner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The woman approached the user, had a conversation, then got aggressive when the user tried to leave. The activist grabbed the leash and pushed the owner, which led to the user reporting her. The police arrested her, and now the user is facing a court date where the activist might get a felony charge.\n\nI should evaluate the actions of both parties. The user was walking their dog, had a conversation, and tried to leave. The activist followed, got confrontational, called the user names, and then physically grabbed the leash and pushed them. That seems like assault. The user then reported this, which led to an arrest. \n\nIn terms of the law, assault is typically a criminal offense. If the activist used force against someone else without consent, that's a crime. The user is defending themselves by reporting the incident. The user didn't initiate the confrontation and was trying to walk away when the activist escalated things. \n\nAnother point is the user's intent. They didn't start the conflict and were trying to leave. The activist's actions were aggressive and unprovoked beyond the initial conversation. The user's action of reporting was in response to an actual crime (assault), not just a disagreement. \n\nThe user mentions feeling conflicted because the other protestors were peaceful. However, reporting an individual for their actions doesn't necessarily criminalize the whole group. The user isn't responsible for the activist's actions. \n\nAlso, the user provided a neighbor as a witness, which supports their account. The activist continued to follow and yell after being asked to leave, which exacerbates the situation. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the user acted within their rights to report an assault. The activist's actions crossed the line into criminal behavior, so the user isn't in the wrong for reporting. The answer should be B (No).\n"
