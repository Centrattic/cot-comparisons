I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and potential felony charge. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was walking their dog when a woman from a protest group (DxE) approached them. The woman made comments about dog breeding and shelters, then escalated by grabbing the dog's leash, pushing the author, and trying to take the dog. The author reported this, and the woman was arrested.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspects. The woman's actions\u2014grabbing the leash, pushing the author\u2014could be considered assault or attempted theft. The author reporting this to the police would be justified if the woman used force against them. The police likely arrested her based on the incident described, so the author isn't necessarily wrong for reporting a crime.\n\nThe author mentions feeling conflicted about the arrest, especially since the other protesters were peaceful. However, the author isn't responsible for the protest's permit revocation if the police determined that Karen's actions justified it. The key here is whether the woman's actions crossed the line into illegal behavior, which seems to be the case based on the account.\n\nThe author also mentions their breeder's route, which the woman criticized. However, the legality of the author's actions isn't in question here. The focus is on whether the author was justified in reporting a crime. Since the woman physically attacked the author and attempted to take the dog, reporting that is within the author's rights.\n\nPotential counterarguments might suggest that the author provoked the situation, but the account says the author was just walking their dog and trying to leave after a conversation. The woman escalated it by following, yelling, and then physically acting out. \n\nAnother point is the felony charge. Felony of the fifth degree varies by jurisdiction, but assault charges can depend on the severity. If the police charged her with a felony, that's their determination, and the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the incident as it happened.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted in self-defense by reporting an assault and attempted theft. They aren't in the wrong for seeking legal recourse after being attacked, even if the context involved a protest. The answer should be B (No).\n"
