I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist who got arrested. The situation is that the activist approached them while walking their dog, had a conversation, and then escalated to grabbing the dog's leash and pushing them. The person then reported her to the police, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The key events are the activist's behavior escalating from a conversation to physical confrontation. The user says that the activist grabbed the leash and pushed them. That's an important detail because physical assault is a criminal act. So, if the activist did that, then the user acting to report it might be justified. \n\nBut the user is questioning whether they're in the wrong because they were part of a protest group. However, the user mentioned that the police revoked the protest permit because Karen was part of DxE. Wait, how do they know that the police revoked the permit? Maybe it was because of her actions. Also, the other protesters were not affected, which the user notes, indicating that the issue was specifically with Karen's actions.\n\nThe user also mentions feeling conflicted because they were in a health-conscious neighborhood and the activist was part of a protest. They might feel some guilt because they support free speech, but Karen's actions crossed into violence. \n\nNow, the legal aspect: if someone physically attacks or attempts to take your property (the dog, which is considered property in legal terms) and causes harm, that's assault. Reporting that to the police is a reasonable response. The user didn't provoke the situation; they were walking their dog and had a conversation that escalated when the activist became aggressive.\n\nAnother point is that the user was trying to defend themselves and protect their dog. The neighbor also witnessed the event and helped, which supports the user's account. The activist's actions\u2014grabbing the leash, pushing, and shouting\u2014constitute assault, so the user acting to report her is justified.\n\nHowever, one could argue that the user might have overreacted by reporting her to the police, but given the physical contact and attempted theft of the dog, it's within their rights to do so. The potential felony charge against Karen is probably for assault or some related charge, which fits the circumstances described.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user tried to de-escalate the situation by walking away and not engaging further. When Karen escalated, the user acted in self-defense and to protect their pet. The user's intent was not to target the activist group as a whole but to report an individual who committed an assault.\n\nSo considering all this, the user is not in the wrong for reporting an assault. The activist's actions were criminal, and the user acted appropriately to seek help from authorities. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
