I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and Karen, who is part of a protest group. \n\nFirst, the key events: Karen approaches the author while she's walking her dog. They have a conversation about dog breeding, which leads to an argument. Karen becomes aggressive, calls the author names, and tries to take the dog's leash. The author then reports her, resulting in Karen's arrest. The author is now facing a felony charge for reporting her, which could lead to jail time and fines.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the facts. Karen's actions included physically pushing the author and trying to take the dog, which is a clear assault. The author reported the incident to the police, which is a natural response to being assaulted. The police arrested Karen, which suggests they found the author's report credible. The author didn't start the conflict; Karen did. The author was defending themselves and their dog. \n\nHowever, there are nuances. The author mentions feeling conflicted about the arrest because they believe in free speech and other protesters weren't involved. But the situation here is specific to Karen's actions. The author didn't target the entire protest group, just the individual who assaulted them. Also, the author didn't provoke the conflict\u2014they were walking their dog when Karen approached. \n\nLegally, if Karen assaulted the author, the author had the right to report it. The author's actions in reporting the assault are justified. The fact that Karen was part of a protest doesn't negate the criminal nature of her actions. The police's decision to revoke the protest permit for Karen might be a broader issue, but the author's direct action in this case was to report a crime. \n\nPotential counterarguments could be that the author overreacted or that the situation was a misunderstanding. But given the physical assault, it's hard to argue that reporting it was wrong. The author's main intent was self-defense. The fact that they're now facing charges for reporting a felony (Karen's actions) seems like a conflict here, but the author's responsibility is more about their own actions, not Karen's legal consequences. \n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within their rights to report an assault. The conflict was initiated by Karen's aggressive behavior, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
