I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was walking their dog in a neighborhood with a lot of health-conscious people and vegan restaurants. They encountered a woman, Karen, who was part of a protest group called DxE. Karen started a conversation about the dog, which led to an argument about breeding dogs and shelters. Karen became aggressive, grabbed the dog's leash, and pushed the author. The police were called, Karen was arrested, and the protest's permit was revoked. The author is now facing a court case and is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did Karen's actions cross a legal threshold that justified reporting her and leading to her arrest? The author says Karen grabbed the leash and pushed them. That sounds like assault or battery, which are criminal offenses. If the police arrested her and revoked the protest permit, that suggests there was some legal basis for the arrest.\n\nThe author mentions feeling conflicted about the situation, especially since they believe in free speech and didn't mean to disrupt the protest. But Karen's actions were directed at the author specifically, not the protest itself. The police were involved, and the neighbor witnessed the incident. The author's actions in reporting Karen might be justified because she was being physically aggressive and endangering their dog.\n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if there was a misunderstanding or if Karen's actions were part of a protected protest activity. But given the description, Karen's behavior escalated into physical confrontation. The author acted to protect themselves and their dog. The police's involvement and the subsequent legal action suggest that the authorities found Karen's actions unlawful.\n\nTherefore, the author's decision to report Karen seems reasonable under the circumstances. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), as they were defending themselves from an assault.\n"
