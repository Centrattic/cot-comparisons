  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for reporting Vegan activist to the police, got her arrested, and facing felony charge now?\n This happened 3 months ago and I got a court date for the case now. I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for reporting a Vegan activist who got arrested and now they're facing a felony charge. They want to know if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The user was walking their dog when a protester approached. The protester started a conversation, then got aggressive, grabbed the leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The user called the police, and the woman was arrested. Now the user is facing a court date where they might be charged with a felony.\n\nThe user is conflicted because they believe in free speech but feel justified in reporting the assault. The key points here are: the protester's actions\u2014was there an actual assault? Did the user have a right to report it? Also, the user mentions that the woman was part of a group, but others were just protesting normally. \n\nLegally, if someone physically assaults you, you can report them. The user seems to have done that. The police arrested the woman, which suggests they saw some form of assault. The user's actions were in self-defense, and they had a witness (the neighbor). However, the question is whether the user overreacted or didn't have grounds to report. \n\nThe user might be worried that the activist was just passionate and not intending to harm, but grabbing someone's leash and pushing them is not just passion\u2014it's a physical confrontation. The user's right to protect themselves and their dog is a factor. The possible charges against the user (like false reporting?) would depend on evidence. Since the police arrested the woman, the user likely had valid grounds. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The user might have escalated things by involving the police, leading to the activist's arrest. The user might be questioning if they were too aggressive in their response. However, under the circumstances, reporting a physical attack is reasonable. \n\nThe outcome is that the user acted in self-defense, reported an actual assault, and the authorities took action. The user's actions seem justifiable, but the story is a bit complex. They might be feeling guilty about the activist facing serious charges, but if the police confirmed an assault, the user isn't in the wrong. So, the answer would be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
