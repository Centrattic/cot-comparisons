I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge. The situation involves a confrontation in a park where the activist, Karen, gets aggressive and tries to take the person's dog. The person then reports her, leading to her arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The key points are: the author was walking their dog, engaged in a conversation with Karen, who became aggressive, tried to grab the dog's leash, pushed the author, and was arrested. The police revoked the protest permit because of Karen's actions, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author overreacted by reporting Karen, leading to her arrest. Legally, if someone uses force or tries to take someone else's property (the dog), that's a criminal act. The author's dog was being grabbed, which could be assault or attempted theft. The police likely acted because Karen used physical force. So, the author reporting her might be justified.\n\nBut there's also the context of the protest. The user mentions that other protesters were just doing their thing. So, Karen's actions might have been outside the permitted protest activities. The police revoking the permit because of her actions suggests that her behavior was a breach of the protest's terms. Therefore, the author didn't target the entire group but a specific individual who crossed the line.\n\nEmotionally, the author felt scared and uncomfortable, which is understandable. They tried to walk away but Karen escalated the situation. The author's defense of their dog and their right to own a purebred from a breeder is a personal choice, and Karen's interference in that choice led to the confrontation.\n\nThe potential felony charge for Karen (fifth degree) might relate to assault or disorderly conduct. The author's actions in reporting her could be seen as self-defense and protecting their property. However, some might argue that the author provoked the situation by engaging in the conversation, but Karen's aggressive actions were the main issue here.\n\nEthically, the author might be seen as defending their rights and safety. Legally, they're within their rights to report a crime. The fact that the neighbor witnessed the incident adds credibility to the author's account. So, the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong because they reported a criminal act that endangered them and their pet.\n"
