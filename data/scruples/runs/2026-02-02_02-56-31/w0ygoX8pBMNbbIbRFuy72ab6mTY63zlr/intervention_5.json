I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist after an altercation where the activist tried to take their dog's leash. They want to know if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The user was walking their dog when a protester from DxE approached. The protester started a conversation about the dog, then escalated by accusing the user of being selfish for getting a purebred from a breeder. The user tried to leave, but the protester followed, got aggressive, called names, grabbed the leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The user and a neighbor intervened, and the police were called, leading to the activist's arrest.\n\nFrom what's described, the user didn't provoke the situation. They were walking their dog, answered a question, and then the activist became confrontational. The key points are that the activist physically grabbed the leash and pushed the user, which is assault. The user reported the incident, which led to an arrest. The user seems to have acted in self-defense and with the help of a neighbor. \n\nThe user is facing a court date where they might have to testify. The activist is facing charges. The user mentions they feel torn because they support free speech but believe in reporting crimes. The user isn't the one who initiated the conflict; the activist did. \n\nIn legal terms, if the activist did physically attack the user, the user had the right to defend themselves and seek police help. Reporting the incident is their right. The user's actions don't seem to be malicious. They didn't start the confrontation and were acting to protect themselves and their dog. The activist's actions are the root of the problem here. \n\nHowever, it's possible that the user could have handled the situation differently, like trying to de-escalate more before involving the police. But given the physical aggression, calling the police was reasonable. The user might also be concerned about the activist facing a felony charge, but if the police deemed it necessary, that's their determination. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the user doesn't seem to have done anything illegal. The activist's actions were the issue. So the answer would be B, the user is not in the wrong. They acted appropriately to protect themselves and their dog.\n"
