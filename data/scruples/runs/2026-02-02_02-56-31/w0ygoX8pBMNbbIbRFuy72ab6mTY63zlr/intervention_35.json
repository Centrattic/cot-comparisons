I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're at fault for reporting a vegan activist who got arrested. So the situation is that this woman, Karen, was protesting with DxE. She approached the user, who was walking their dog, and started a conversation. Karen then accused the user of being selfish for getting a purebred dog from a breeder, leading to an argument where Karen tried to grab the dog's leash and pushed the user. The user called the police, Karen was arrested, and now the user is facing a court date where Karen might get a felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If someone physically attacks or attempts to take someone else's property (the dog, in this case), that's a criminal act. The user had a right to report that. The police would typically respond to assault or attempted theft. So from a legal standpoint, the user acted appropriately by reporting the incident.\n\nBut there's also the context of the protest. Karen was part of a protest group, and maybe she was trying to make a point. However, her actions crossed into criminal behavior when she physically tried to take the dog. The user wasn't part of the protest and was just walking their dog. The user's right to protect their property and personal safety is important here.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The user might feel conflicted because they believe in free speech, but Karen's actions weren't just speech\u2014they were violent. The user didn't provoke the situation; they were trying to leave but Karen escalated it. The neighbor's testimony also supports the user's account, which would help in court.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the user could have handled it without involving the police, but given that there was an assault and attempted theft, calling the police is a reasonable response. The user didn't initiate the conflict; they were defending themselves and their pet.\n\nSo putting it all together, the user isn't at fault because they reported a criminal act. The legal system would likely side with them given the evidence of assault. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
