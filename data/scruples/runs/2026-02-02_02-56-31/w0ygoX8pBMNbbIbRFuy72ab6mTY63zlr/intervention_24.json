I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they reported a vegan activist, Karen, to the police after she got into a confrontation. The user ended up getting their dog back, and Karen was arrested and might face a felony charge. The user is now facing a court date and wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The user was walking their dog, which they bought from a breeder. Karen approached them, started a conversation, and then turned it into an argument about dog breeding. She accused the user of being selfish for getting a purebred dog from a breeder instead of adopting from a shelter. The user defended their choice, but Karen escalated the situation by grabbing the dog's leash, pushing the user, and trying to take the dog. The user then called the police, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nKey points here: Did Karen commit a crime? The user claims that Karen grabbed the leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. If that's true, then she committed assault and attempted theft or something similar. The user reported her because she was acting aggressively and trying to take their dog, which is a clear criminal act. The user is defending their property (their dog) and their safety.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the user provoked the situation by engaging with Karen in the first place. But the user didn't instigate the confrontation; Karen did. The user was just walking their dog when Karen approached. The user tried to walk away and set boundaries by saying it was none of her business, but Karen escalated it. The user only called the police after the physical assault and attempted theft. \n\nAnother angle is the protest permit being revoked. The user mentioned that the police revoked DxE's permit because Karen was part of it. If the other protesters were peaceful, the user might feel bad about affecting the whole group's permit. But the user's responsibility here is to report a crime. If Karen was acting outside the bounds of the protest by using violence, that's her responsibility. The user isn't at fault for a lawful protest if one individual's actions led to legal consequences.\n\nAlso, the user is facing a felony charge. The nature of the charge is important. If the user is being charged for reporting Karen, that's a different issue, but the user is the one who reported a crime. Unless the user fabricated the incident, which there's no indication of, they're not at fault. The police would have investigated and arrested Karen based on the reported crime. \n\nThe user's argument that they bought the dog for $2500 and it's a purebred might be relevant to their intent, but in legal terms, the key is whether there was a crime committed. The user isn't in the wrong for owning a purebred dog or choosing a breeder; that's a personal choice. The issue is the physical confrontation. The user's actions were in response to a violent act by Karen. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the user didn't need to call the police, but when someone is physically attacking you and trying to take your pet, calling the police is reasonable. Also, the user might be facing legal issues because they could be charged with false reporting, but the user has a neighbor as a witness. The police would have considered that. \n\nIn conclusion, unless there's evidence the user lied about the incident, they aren't at fault. Karen's actions were criminal, and the user is within their rights to report a crime. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
