I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was walking their dog when a protester approached, had a conversation, and things escalated when the protester grabbed the dog's leash and pushed them. The author reported the incident, leading to Karen's arrest. \n\nNow, considering the facts. The key here is whether the author had a right to report the incident. The police's role is to handle such situations, so if a crime occurred\u2014like assault or theft\u2014reporting it is appropriate. The author claims Karen pushed them and tried to take the dog, which could be assault and attempted theft. The neighbor witnessed it, so there's a witness.\n\nBut wait, was the report justified? Did the author have the right to involve the police when someone is acting aggressively? If someone physically assaults you or tries to take your property (the dog), that's a criminal act. Reporting it isn't wrong. \n\nHowever, sometimes people might overreact or report minor incidents as crimes. But in this case, the protester grabbed the leash, pushed the person, and tried to take the dog. That's not just a minor argument. The police would likely take that as a credible report. Also, the author mentioned that the police revoked the protestor's permit, which suggests they found some fault with Karen's actions.\n\nAnother angle: Free speech. The author feels bad about disrupting the protest. But free speech doesn't protect criminal acts. If Karen was participating in a legal protest but then committed a crime (assault), that's a separate matter. The author isn't wrong for reporting a criminal act, even if it affects the protest.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author provoked the situation by discussing dog breeding? But in the conversation, the author explained their choice of breeder. Karen escalated by yelling and physically acting out. The author didn't instigate the physical contact. \n\nAlso, the cost of the dog and the potential fine match, which could be a coincidence. The author might feel justified because the cost is similar to the possible fine. But that's not a factor in legal right. \n\nIn terms of legal wrongs, the author isn't the one accused. The question is whether the author did something wrong by reporting. Since the police took action and the court case is happening, it suggests that the police found probable cause. Unless there's evidence the author lied, they aren't in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a criminal act when they were physically assaulted and their property (dog) was at risk.\n"
