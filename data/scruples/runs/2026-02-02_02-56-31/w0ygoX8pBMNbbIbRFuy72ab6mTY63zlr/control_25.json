I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the person and a protester from DxE. Here's what happened: Karen approached the person while they were walking their dog, started talking about dogs in shelters, then criticized their breeder choice, and escalated by grabbing the leash and pushing them. The person called the police, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the person had a right to report Karen. The key points here are the physical altercation. Karen grabbing the leash and pushing the person could be considered assault. The person's neighbor witnessed the event, which adds credibility to their account. Reporting a crime is a civic duty, so if Karen did commit a crime, the person was justified in calling the police.\n\nHowever, I should consider the initial interaction. Karen was part of a protest, but she wasn't wearing a sign and was dressed normally. She approached the person, leading to a conversation that escalated. The person might have felt threatened, but the trigger was Karen's physical aggression. The person didn't provoke her with their dog ownership; they explained their breeder choice and asked her to leave them alone.\n\nThe police revoked the protest's permit because of Karen's actions, which might have been due to her violating protest regulations through aggressive behavior. The person might not be at fault here, as they were defending themselves. The charges against Karen (felony fifth degree) might relate to assault, which the person reported accurately.\n\nThere's a possible ethical dilemma about whether the person overreacted, but since Karen physically attacked them, the person had the right to self-defense and to report the incident. The person also mentioned feeling bad about the other protesters, indicating they respect free speech, which is a positive aspect.\n\nIn conclusion, the person acted within their rights to report a crime. Karen's actions were the direct cause of the charges. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
