I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they were walking their dog, got into an argument with a vegan activist from DxE, and she tried to take their dog. They reported her, she got arrested, and now they're facing a court case where she might get a felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happened. The author was approached by Karen, who started talking about dog shelters and then escalated into an argument. The author said they had a reputable breeder, and Karen accused them of being selfish. Then Karen grabbed the dog's leash, pushed them, tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor stopped her, called the police, and she was arrested. The police revoked the protest permit because of her actions. The author is now worried they did the wrong thing by reporting her, even though they understand free speech.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong for reporting her. Let's break it down. The key points are: Did Karen's actions justify the author reporting her? Was the author acting within their rights to protect their dog? Was there a legal justification for the police to arrest her?\n\nKaren grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. That sounds like assault or attempted theft. The author was protecting their property (the dog) and themselves. In most places, you can use reasonable force to protect yourself and your property. The author didn't use violence; they just tried to regain control of the leash with help from a neighbor. Then they called the police, which is standard procedure when someone is being attacked or their property is being taken. \n\nThe police arrested Karen because she was engaging in assault and trying to take someone else's dog. The fact that she was part of a protest doesn't mean her actions are protected. Free speech allows protests, but not violent acts or theft. So the police were right to intervene. \n\nThe author might feel conflicted because the other protesters were just doing their thing, but Karen's actions were criminal. The author reported her because she was committing a crime, not because of her vegan activism. The author isn't targeting her for her beliefs but for her illegal actions. \n\nNow, could the author be in the wrong? Maybe if they provoked the situation or if Karen's actions didn't reach the threshold of a felony. But in this case, assault and attempted theft are serious crimes. The author was defending themselves and their dog. The police agreed and arrested her. So the author's actions were justified. \n\nAnother angle: Did the author have the right to report her? Yes. Anyone can report a crime. The author wasn't lying; they told the truth to the police. The outcome of the court case (felony charge for Karen) depends on the evidence, but the author isn't responsible for that outcome. They acted appropriately in the moment. \n\nThe author also mentions feeling bad about revoking the protest permit for everyone. But that's a consequence of Karen's actions, not the author's. The police decided to revoke the permit because of her specific behavior, not the entire group. The author didn't target the protest; they only reported the person who attacked them. \n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They were protecting themselves and their dog from a criminal act. Reporting it was the right thing to do. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
