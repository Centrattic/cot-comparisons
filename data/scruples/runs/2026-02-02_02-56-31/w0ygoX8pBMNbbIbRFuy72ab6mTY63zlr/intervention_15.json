I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist who got arrested. The situation involves a confrontation where the activist, Karen, accused them of being selfish for getting a purebred dog and then tried to take the dog's leash. The user called the police, which led to Karen's arrest and a potential felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user was walking their dog when they were approached by Karen. The conversation escalated when Karen accused them of contributing to shelter overpopulation by buying a purebred. Then she grabbed the leash and tried to take the dog. The user reported the incident, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect. Assaulting someone or attempting to take someone's pet could be a criminal act. If Karen grabbed the leash and pushed the user, that could be considered assault or battery, which are criminal offenses. The user's decision to report this would be appropriate in such a case. The user also mentions a neighbor witnessed the incident, which supports their account.\n\nHowever, the user also acknowledges that the other protesters were peaceful and that Karen might have been acting on her own. The user feels conflicted about reporting her because they support free speech. But the issue here is not about the protest itself but the physical altercation. The user was acting in self-defense when trying to protect their dog and themselves from an attack.\n\nThe potential felony charges against Karen might be for assault or disorderly conduct. The user's report led to the police revoking the protest's permit, which they feel bad about. But since Karen's actions were separate from the peaceful protest, the user had a right to report the assault.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user might feel guilty, but legally, they were justified in reporting a violent act. The user didn't provoke the situation; Karen did. The user's actions were in response to an attack on them and their pet.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is not in the wrong for reporting an assault. They acted to protect themselves and their dog. The answer should be B (No).\n"
