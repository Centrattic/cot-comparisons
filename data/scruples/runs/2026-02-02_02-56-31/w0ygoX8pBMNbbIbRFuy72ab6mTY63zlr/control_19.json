I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves an encounter during a protest where the activist, Karen, started a conversation with the person about their dog, escalated into an argument, and ended with Karen trying to grab the dog's leash. The person reported her, leading to her arrest. The user is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Karen approached the person while they were walking their dog. They had a conversation where Karen mentioned the euthanasia of dogs in shelters, which the person found uncomfortable. The person explained their breeder choice. Then Karen escalated by calling them names, grabbing the leash, pushing them, and trying to take the dog. The neighbor witnessed this, and the police were called. Karen was arrested.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did Karen's actions justify the arrest? The person reported her for a physical altercation, which is a crime. If Karen physically assaulted the person, that's a criminal act, and reporting it is appropriate. However, if the person provoked the situation by engaging with a protestor, that could be a factor. But according to the account, Karen was the one who initiated the argument and then escalated it to physical contact. The person tried to walk away but was followed and attacked. The police arrested her, which suggests they saw a crime occurred.\n\nThe person might be in the right because they were defending themselves and their pet. However, some might argue that engaging with a protestor in the first place could be seen as provocation, but in this case, the conversation started innocently. The user also mentioned that the protest was allowed, but the individual's actions went beyond peaceful protest into assault. The person had the right to seek help if their safety was threatened. Also, the fact that the neighbor witnessed the incident adds credibility to the person's account. \n\nOn the other hand, if the person felt the situation was minor and overreacted by pressing charges, that could be a point against them. But given that there was a physical attack and the police were involved, it seems justified. Plus, the person wasn't part of the protest and was just walking their dog when the confrontation happened. The charges against Karen seem proportional to the act.\n\nIn conclusion, the person is likely not in the wrong because they reported a criminal act of assault. They acted to protect themselves and their dog, and there's a witness. The activist took the confrontation too far, and the person's response was appropriate.\n"
