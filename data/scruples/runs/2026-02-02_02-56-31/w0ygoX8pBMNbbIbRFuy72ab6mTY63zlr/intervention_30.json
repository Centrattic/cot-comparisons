  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for reporting Vegan activist to the police, got her arrested, and facing felony charge now?\n This happened 3 months ago and I got a court date for the case now. I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is at fault here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person was walking their dog when a woman from DxE (Direct Action Everywhere) approached them. The woman asked about the dog, and then started discussing dog breeding, implying that buying a purebred from a breeder is bad because of shelter dogs being euthanized. The person said they chose a breeder for specific traits and a reputable one. Then the woman got aggressive, called them names, tried to grab the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The person reported her, leading to her arrest and possible felony charges.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the person have a right to report her? Was the woman's actions justifiable? Was there actual assault or harassment?\n\nThe police arrested her, so they must have seen some wrongdoing. The person didn't provoke the situation beyond explaining their choice. The woman escalated by following, yelling, and physically trying to take the dog. Even if the woman was passionate about her cause, using physical aggression is illegal. The person acted in self-defense by retrieving their dog and getting police involved. The neighbor witnessed it, supporting their side. The person didn't start the conflict and tried to walk away. Reporting her to prevent further harm is reasonable. So, the person isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
