I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and facing a felony charge now. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog when they encountered Karen, a DxE protestor. The interaction started with a friendly comment about the dog, then escalated when Karen mentioned dogs being gassed in shelters. The author said they knew that but chose a breeder. Karen then accused them of being selfish, followed by grabbing the leash and trying to take the dog. The author got help from a neighbor, reported the incident to the police, and Karen was arrested. The author now feels conflicted because they believe in free speech but are worried about Karen's potential jail time.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to assess the legality of their actions. When Karen grabbed the leash and tried to take the dog, that could be considered assault or theft, depending on local laws. The author's act of reporting the incident to the police and providing a statement is within their rights as a victim of an alleged crime. The police arresting Karen based on the report would be part of their duty to enforce the law.\n\nHowever, there might be nuances. The initial confrontation involved Karen's speech, which is protected under free speech. But when she physically attacked the author, that's a different matter. The key point is whether the police had probable cause to arrest Karen for an actual crime. If her actions were indeed assault and theft, then the author isn't at fault for reporting the incident. \n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling torn about the outcome, especially regarding the free speech aspect. But the author isn't responsible for the police's decision to revoke the protest permit; that's up to the authorities. The author's role was to report the assault. They didn't fabricate the incident. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author acted within their rights as a victim of a crime. They provided a report to the police, which is their legal right. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
