I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author reported a vegan activist, Karen, to the police after an altercation. The result was that Karen got arrested and is now facing a felony charge. The author is now going to court and wants to know if they're the one at fault.\n\nFirst, let's break down the events. The author was walking their dog in a park where a protest was happening. Karen approached them, started a conversation about the dog, then escalated by making a comment about dogs in shelters being gassed. The author mentioned they use a breeder because they wanted specific traits, but Karen accused them of being selfish and even tried to grab the dog's leash. The police were called, Karen was arrested, and the protest permit was revoked. The author is now facing legal consequences and feels conflicted because they believe in free speech, but also think Karen might have gone too far.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author was in their right to walk away from the situation, but Karen's actions escalated to physical confrontation\u2014grabbing the leash and pushing. That's a key part here. If someone is grabbing another person's leash and trying to take their dog, that's a form of assault or attempted theft, depending on local laws. The author then called the police, which is a normal response to such an incident. The police's decision to revoke the protest permit might be because Karen was violating the terms of their protest by engaging in aggressive behavior, not the author's right to report her.\n\nBut wait, the author was initially in a conversation, and Karen was part of a protest group. The author might have provoked some response if Karen felt her activism was being challenged. However, the author's right to own a breeder dog and the breeder route they chose is their personal choice. Karen's reaction might have been an overstep, but the author's response in calling the police is within their rights when someone tries to physically take their property (the dog) forcefully.\n\nAlso, the author is now facing legal action because they reported Karen. The question is whether the author's actions were justified. The key here is that the author didn't initiate the confrontation. Karen escalated the situation by grabbing the leash and trying to take the dog. The police's involvement was appropriate in that context. So the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a criminal act. However, the author might have considered de-escalating first, but given Karen's actions, it's a valid response to seek police help.\n\nAnother angle is free speech. The author mentions that the other protesters were peaceful, and they're worried about revoking the permit for all of them. But Karen's actions were not part of a peaceful protest\u2014she was engaging in aggressive behavior. The police's decision to revoke the permit might be due to her actions, not the author's. So the author isn't at fault for Karen's actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were in self-defense and protection of their property (the dog). Reporting someone who physically confronts and tries to take your dog is justified. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
