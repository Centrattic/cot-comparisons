I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong after reporting a vegan activist, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and a protester who became aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author is walking their dog and is approached by Karen, a DxE activist. Karen starts a conversation, then criticizes the author for getting a purebred dog from a breeder instead of adopting from a shelter. The argument escalates, Karen grabs the leash, pushes the author, and tries to take the dog. The police are called, Karen is arrested, and the author is now facing legal issues.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if Karen used physical force (grabbing the leash and pushing), that could be assault or battery. The author's action of reporting her to the police could be justified as self-defense. However, sometimes people might feel they're justified in calling police, but if the situation was de-escalated differently, maybe they could have avoided legal trouble.\n\nBut the key points here are that Karen grabbed the leash and pushed the author. Those actions can be criminal. The author didn't provoke her beyond the initial conversation. They tried to walk away, but Karen escalated the situation. The police were called after the incident, and the author didn't instigate the violence. The neighbor witnessed it, which supports the author's side.\n\nHowever, the police might have considered if the author used excessive force or if there was mutual combat. But in this case, the author was the victim of a physical attack. So reporting it seems within their rights. Also, the fact that Karen was part of a protest group but acted individually here complicates things. The author didn't target the entire group; they only reported the person who attacked them.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that other protesters were just doing their thing, so they didn't report them. The author might feel guilty about that, but the question is about their own actions. The arrest was due to Karen's actions, not the protest itself.\n\nPossible counterarguments: maybe the author shouldn't have engaged in the conversation, but that's not illegal. The author tried to leave, which is reasonable. The key is the response to the physical aggression. In many jurisdictions, you can report someone for assault even if there's a disagreement in values (like animal breeding vs. adoption). The author isn't in the wrong for defending themselves.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably isn't in the wrong because they were a victim of assault. Reporting the aggressive behavior is appropriate. The answer would be B.\n"
