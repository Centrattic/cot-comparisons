I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person was walking their dog when they encountered a protestor from DxE. The woman (Karen) started talking to them about their dog, then got aggressive, accused them of being selfish, and tried to take the dog. The author reported her, leading to her arrest. Now, the author is facing a court case and is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the author justified in reporting Karen to the police? Did Karen's actions cross a legal line?\n\nKaren grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. That sounds like assault or some form of physical aggression. The author and a neighbor reported the incident. The police arrested her, which suggests that they found her actions sufficient for an arrest. \n\nThe author might be concerned because they feel bad about the consequences for Karen, especially since she was part of a protest group. But the author's main argument is self-defense and protecting their dog. The question is whether the author overreacted by reporting her. \n\nIn most cases, if someone physically attacks another person or attempts to take their property (the dog), reporting it is not only right but expected. The police revoking the protest permit because Karen was part of the group might indicate that her actions were outside the scope of the protest and illegal. \n\nThe author might be in the right because they were acting to protect themselves and their property. However, there's a possible issue if the author provoked the situation or if Karen's actions were within protected speech. But since Karen used physical force, that's a criminal act, not just free speech. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They reported a crime, which is their duty. The fact that Karen was part of a protest doesn't make her actions justified if she committed assault. The answer is B.\n"
