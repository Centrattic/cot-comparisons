I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog when a woman from DxE approached them. There was a conversation about the dog's breed and animal shelters, which escalated into an argument. The woman then physically grabbed the dog's leash and pushed the author. The author and a neighbor intervened, leading to the woman's arrest. Now the author is facing a court case and is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Did the author have a right to report the woman? 2) Was the woman's action a criminal act? 3) Did the author overreact or act in self-defense?\n\nThe woman grabbed the leash and pushed the author. Assault is a criminal act, so reporting her would be legitimate. However, the context matters. The woman was protesting, even though she didn't have a sign. But she did physically attack the author, which is a separate issue from free speech. The police revoked her protest permit because of her actions, which suggests they saw her behavior as criminal.\n\nThe author's actions: reporting a crime (assault) is not wrong. They were defending themselves and their dog. The neighbor corroborated the story. The author might have felt uncomfortable initially, but after the physical attack, calling the police was appropriate.\n\nPotential issues: The initial argument might have been confrontational, but once it turned physical, the author had every right to involve authorities. The woman's actions were the immediate cause for the arrest. The author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. Also, the outcome (the woman facing felony charges) seems to align with the seriousness of the assault. Since the author acted within their rights to seek help after an assault, the answer is likely B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
