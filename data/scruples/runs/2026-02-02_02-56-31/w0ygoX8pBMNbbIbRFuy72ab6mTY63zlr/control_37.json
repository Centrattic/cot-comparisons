I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist who got arrested. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and Karen, a protester from DxE.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author was walking their dog, and Karen approached them. Karen started a conversation about the dog but then escalated into an argument about breeding versus shelters. Karen got aggressive, grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author reported her, leading to her arrest.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspects. Assault is a criminal offense. If Karen pushed the author and tried to take the dog, that's physical aggression. The author reported the incident, which is their right. The police arrested her, which suggests they found enough evidence of a crime. The author's actions in reporting the assault are justified because they were protecting themselves and their dog.\n\nBut wait, were the other protesters involved? The user mentions that the DxE permit was revoked because of Karen's actions. The author felt bad about affecting the protest, but they clarified that they only reported Karen's specific actions, not the entire group. They also mention that other protesters were just doing their thing, so the author didn't target the group.\n\nEthically, the author had the right to defend themselves against assault. The police handled the situation, and the author didn't use excessive force. They called the police and provided a witness (the neighbor). The author might have felt conflicted because they respect free speech, but the act of reporting a crime isn't against the protesters' rights. The author's actions were in self-defense and to prevent harm to their dog.\n\nThe possible issue could be if the author's response was disproportionate. However, Karen's actions were aggressive and dangerous, trying to take the dog. The author's report leading to an arrest is appropriate in this case. The outcome (felony charge) is up to the legal system, but the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime.\n"
