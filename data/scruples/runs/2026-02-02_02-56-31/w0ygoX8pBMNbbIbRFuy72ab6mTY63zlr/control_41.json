I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting the vegan activist to the police and getting her arrested, leading to a possible felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was walking their dog when a protestor from DxE approached and started a conversation. The conversation escalated when the woman, Karen, accused the author of being selfish for buying a purebred dog from a breeder. The author tried to walk away, but Karen pushed them and tried to take the dog. The author then reported her, resulting in her arrest.\n\nSo, the key points here: the initial interaction started with a friendly question about the dog. Karen then brought up a sensitive issue about shelter dogs, which the author had already explained they were aware of but chose a breeder. The author walked away, but Karen escalated by calling them names, pushing them, and attempting to take the dog. The author called the police, and Karen was arrested for assault or something similar.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspects. If Karen physically pushed the author and tried to take the dog, that's probably assault and attempted theft or something. The author's actions in reporting this would be justified if the police determined that Karen committed a crime. The author wasn't instigating; they were trying to leave. The activist's actions crossed a line into physical aggression.\n\nBut there's also the context of free speech. The protest was happening, and Karen was part of a group. The author mentions feeling bad about the other protesters being affected because their permit was revoked. However, the individual actions of Karen don't reflect on the entire protest group. The author didn't target the entire group, just the person who assaulted them.\n\nThe author might feel conflicted because they have some sympathy for the cause, but the act of reporting a violent incident is generally not wrong. The police's role is to handle such incidents, and the author was within their rights to report an assault. The possible felony charge against Karen depends on the jurisdiction and the nature of the assault. If it's a minor assault, maybe a felony fifth degree, but if it's more severe, higher charges.\n\nThe author might be in the right because they were defending themselves against an unprovoked attack. However, there's a question of whether the initial conversation could have been de-escalated. The author did try to walk away, which is a reasonable action. The activist's reaction was what led to the escalation.\n\nIt's also important to note that the author has a neighbor who witnessed the event, which supports their account. If the police took the report and arrested Karen, that suggests there was enough evidence to support the charges. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting a crime, even if the other person was part of a protest. The line between free speech and illegal activity is crossed when there's physical aggression.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They reported a violent incident, which is their right. The activist's actions were criminal, and the author was a victim. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
