I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for reporting the vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person was walking their dog when a protester approached. The protester started a conversation, then escalated into an argument about breeding dogs. The protester grabbed the leash, pushed the person, and tried to take the dog. The person reported this, and the police arrested the protester. The author is now facing charges as a result of their report.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the person did the right thing by reporting the assault. The key points are the physical actions of the protester\u2014grabbing the leash, pushing, and trying to take the dog. Those are physical confrontations. The person acted in self-defense by trying to protect their dog and themselves. The neighbor also witnessed the incident. \n\nThe author might be in the right because they were defending themselves against an attack. However, they do express some hesitation about the consequences for the protester, acknowledging that the activist might have been acting out of passion but still crossed a line with physical violence. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the person had a right to report the assault. Since the protester used force against them, the person had a right to seek police assistance. The author didn't provoke the situation; they were reacting to an attack. The neighbor's testimony supports their account. \n\nThe potential issue might be if the author exaggerated the situation, but there's no indication of that. The person just reported what happened. Even if the protestor had valid reasons for being passionate about animal welfare, physically attacking someone is a criminal act. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the assault. They acted within their rights to protect themselves and their dog. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
