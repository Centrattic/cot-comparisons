I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between the author and a vegan activist named Karen during a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was walking their dog when Karen, who was part of a protest, approached them. Karen started a conversation about the dog, then accused the author of being selfish for getting a purebred from a breeder. The conversation escalated when Karen grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor witnessed this and reported her, leading to Karen's arrest and potential felony charges. The author is now worried they did something wrong by reporting her, especially since Karen was part of a protest group. They also mention feeling conflicted about the free speech aspect but don't think Karen deserved jail.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether the author acted appropriately by reporting Karen. From the description, Karen's actions went beyond peaceful protest. She physically assaulted the author by grabbing the leash and pushing them. This is a criminal act, not just a disagreement or protest tactic. The author reported the actual assault, which is their right. The police arrested Karen because she committed a crime, not just for protesting. The author didn't provoke the situation; Karen was the aggressor. The author's decision to involve the police was a legitimate response to an assault. Even though the protest was ongoing, the police revoked the permit specifically because Karen was part of the group and her actions were criminal. The author isn't responsible for Karen's actions. They took a stand against violence and self-defense. The potential felony charge against Karen seems justified given the physical assault. The author's concern about free speech doesn't apply here because they weren't restricting protest rights but reporting a crime. There's no indication the author exaggerated or fabricated the incident. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
