We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a pregnant woman who hasn't told her biological family, who she's not close with. She ran away from home due to an abusive, controlling family environment. Now she's considering whether she's in the wrong for not telling them about her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The user ran away from an abusive family. The mother is described as narcissistic, the grandfather as controlling. The family is extremely religious and controlling. The user left to escape that environment and has since built a life with a partner. She's now pregnant but hasn't told her family. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she feels conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key factors here are the nature of her relationship with her family, the reasons she hasn't told them, and the potential consequences of telling them.\n\nShe hasn't been in contact with them except for rare texts that turn into screaming. The family's behavior is hostile. She's afraid of their reaction, possible rejection, and the impact on her child. She's worried they might treat her child the same way she was treated. \n\nIn ethical terms, withholding information from someone isn't inherently wrong if the reasons are justified. Here, the reasons are based on safety and well-being. Her family's history of abuse and control makes it reasonable to avoid contact. She's prioritizing her and her child's safety over family obligations. \n\nHowever, there's a possible guilt she feels about not informing them. But if the family isn't part of her life, and they haven't been supportive, it's not her responsibility to maintain that relationship. The concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often looks at intent and whether the action was malicious. Here, her intent is self-preservation and protecting her child, not malice.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say family should be informed of a grandchild. But if the family is toxic, it's reasonable to exclude them. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy from people who are part of her life; the family has disengaged themselves. \n\nAlso, the user's fear of the child being affected by toxic family is valid. It's a protective measure. So, in this context, not informing the family isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
