We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is that the author had a very toxic family environment, ran away at 20, and hasn't been in contact with them except for occasional hostile texts. She's now pregnant and considering whether to tell them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The family is described as controlling and abusive, with a narcissistic mother and cult-like grandfather. The author left because of this abuse. She's in a healthy relationship now and feels guilty about not telling her family. The question is whether not informing them makes her the asshole.\n\nFrom a typical AITA perspective, people often consider the balance between family obligations and personal well-being. In cases where there's a history of abuse, many would argue that the person isn't obligated to maintain contact for their own safety. The author hasn't been in regular contact, so maybe the expectation isn't there. Also, the fear of negative reactions and potential harm to the child is a significant factor.\n\nThe key points are the abuse history, lack of communication, and the author's right to protect herself and her child. In similar cases, the community usually sides with the person who has left an abusive situation and is prioritizing their well-being. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author isn't obligated to inform her family if it's harmful to her and the child. The guilt might be from societal expectations, but her safety and her child's well-being are more important.\n"
