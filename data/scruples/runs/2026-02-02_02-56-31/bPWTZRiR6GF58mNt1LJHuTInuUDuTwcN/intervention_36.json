We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They have a history of a very controlling and abusive family. They ran away at 20 because of the mental abuse, controlling behaviors, and religious extremism. Now they're pregnant with their partner's baby, and they're scared to tell their family.\n\nSo, the question is whether not telling them makes them the \"asshole.\" Let's break down the factors here. The family isn't really in contact except for occasional hostile messages. The person hasn't initiated contact, only the family does, which turns into yelling. The person left because of abuse, so there's a valid reason for the estrangement.\n\nOn one hand, some might argue that they should tell their family because they're a parent now and maybe the family has a right to know. But considering the history of abuse, control, and possible rejection, it's reasonable for them to prioritize their safety and their child's well-being. The fear of family reacting negatively and the potential harm to the child from entering a toxic environment is a strong point. Also, the family isn't exactly making contact in a healthy way; their messages are hostile.\n\nThe person is also considering the child's future, worried that the family might treat the child the same way they did. That's a valid concern. Choosing not to tell them might be protecting both themselves and the unborn child from further harm. There's no pressure from the boyfriend, so they're not being forced into this by a partner's demands.\n\nAnother angle: legal obligations? In some places, there might be requirements for parents to inform family members, but typically, unless there's a legal custody or support situation, it's not a legal obligation. Since they're estranged and the family isn't part of their life, legally they might not have to tell them. Ethically, it's more about the person's right to autonomy and safety.\n\nThe guilt they feel is understandable, but guilt can be a red herring when the environment is toxic. They might be internalizing the family's potential criticism, but if the family isn't supportive or respectful, it's not their responsibility to include them in their life.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong. They have a history that justifies their decision to protect themselves and their child. The answer is B.\n"
