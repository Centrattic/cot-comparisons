We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The situation is complicated. They left home at 20 because the family was controlling and abusive, especially the mom, who's described as narcissistic. The grandfather runs the family like a cult with extreme religious views. The user now has a stable job, a home, a boyfriend who makes them happy, and they're 37 weeks pregnant.\n\nThey haven't told their family because they're afraid of the reaction. The family hasn't been in contact much except for occasional hostile texts. The user is scared the family will blame them for hiding the pregnancy, call them names, and that the baby might be affected by the family's behavior. They're worried the baby might later resent them for not having that part of the family in her life.\n\nSo, the question is whether not telling the family makes the user at fault. On one hand, there's the argument that family should know about a grandchild. On the other hand, the family was abusive, controlling, and the user left for their own well-being. The user is protecting themselves and their unborn child from potential harm. The family isn't in their life except for negative interactions. Also, the user hasn't been the one reaching out, so maybe the responsibility isn't on them to inform.\n\nThe key points here are the past abuse, the current lack of communication, and the potential risk to the child's well-being. The user's decision is likely based on self-preservation and protecting their child. Since the family hasn't maintained a healthy relationship, the user isn't obligated to share the news. They\u2019re not hiding it in a healthy relationship; rather, they\u2019re avoiding contact with toxic family members. The fear of the family's reaction and the history of abuse makes the user's choice understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
