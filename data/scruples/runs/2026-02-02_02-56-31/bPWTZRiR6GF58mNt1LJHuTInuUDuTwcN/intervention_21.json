  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not telling my mom that I'm pregnant?\nI'm about 37 weeks pregnant but I still haven't told any of my biological family. We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They have a history of a very toxic family, abusive parents, a cult-like environment, and they ran away. Now they're pregnant and haven't told their family, fearing their reaction. The boyfriend hasn't pushed them, but they feel guilt anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. On one hand, family might expect to be informed about a grandchild. But on the other hand, the user has a valid reason to avoid contact due to past abuse. The key points here are the safety of the user and the child, the history of abuse, and the lack of a healthy relationship with their family.\n\nThe user is 37 weeks pregnant, which is almost due. The question is whether they have an obligation to inform their family. If the family is a risk to their well-being or the child's, then staying silent is justified. The user is protecting themselves and the baby from potential harm. Ethically, protecting one's family from a harmful environment is a strong point.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of the child's future. The user wonders if the child might hate them. But if the family hasn't been involved and is abusive, withholding that information might protect the child from trauma. The user might fear judgment for being unmarried, but that's their family's issue, not theirs.\n\nThe question is whether they are in the wrong. If the family has been non-communicative except for harassment, then the user isn't hiding the pregnancy from an active relationship, just from estranged, abusive relatives. So, the answer would lean towards B, not in the wrong. They're prioritizing safety and well-being over a fractured relationship.\n"
