We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. The main question is whether they're in the wrong for not telling. \n\nFirst, the context is important. They had a very controlling, abusive family environment with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. They left home at 20 due to mental abuse. The family is extremely religious and controlling, invading their privacy and controlling their finances. Now, they've been out of contact except for rare texts where the family screams at them.\n\nThey're worried about the family's reaction to the pregnancy, especially since they might criticize them for being unmarried. They also fear their child might not get to meet the family or face the same treatment. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse and the current lack of communication. The person is protecting themselves and their unborn child from potential harm. They're not hiding the pregnancy from someone who's part of their current life; the family hasn't been involved for years and has been hostile. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the family hasn't maintained a healthy relationship and has been abusive, the person isn't obligated to share personal news. The guilt might come from societal expectations about family, but their safety and well-being are paramount. Also, considering the child's future, exposing them to a toxic environment isn't in their best interest.\n\nLegally, there's no requirement to inform biological family unless there's a custody issue or something, but emotionally, it's about what's healthy. Since the family isn't supportive and has a history of abuse, withholding the information isn't wrong. The person is prioritizing their own and their child's mental health. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the decision is based on protecting themselves and their child from a harmful family dynamic.\n"
