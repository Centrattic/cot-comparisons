We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is that the author left home two years ago because of a controlling and abusive family. The mother is described as a narcissist, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. They haven't spoken much since she left, and when they do, the communication is hostile.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse and control. The author is in a stable relationship now and is pregnant. She's worried that if she tells her family, they'll react negatively, maybe blame her for being unmarried, and potentially harm her child. The question is whether she's doing something wrong by not informing them.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of the family. If the family has a history of abuse, invasion of privacy, and control, then the author's decision to distance herself is a form of self-preservation. Not telling them isn't about hiding but protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The user is asking if she's in the wrong, so from a moral standpoint, it's about whether there's an obligation to inform family despite a hostile environment.\n\nIn many cases, people have the right to protect themselves from toxic relationships. The author isn't cutting off contact entirely but is only responding to occasional messages that turn into arguments. The decision to not share such a personal life event with a family that has been abusive isn't necessarily in the wrong. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations of keeping family informed, but in abusive situations, those expectations might not apply.\n\nAlso, the child's well-being is a concern. The author is worried about the family's treatment of the child, which is a valid fear given their past behavior. Choosing not to involve them could be in the child's best interest. So, considering all this, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author is protecting herself and her child from a harmful environment.\n"
