  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not telling my mom that I'm pregnant?\nI'm about 37 weeks pregnant but I still haven't told any of my biological family. We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong. The question is whether they did something wrong by not telling their mom they're pregnant. The person ran away from home after experiencing controlling and abusive behavior from their family. They're now in a stable relationship and pregnant, but haven't contacted their family. The family only reaches out occasionally in a hostile way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions their family is controlling, abusive, and part of a cult-like environment. They left because of this, which is their right. The decision to not tell them about the pregnancy might stem from self-preservation and protecting their new family. \n\nThe user feels guilty because maybe they think there's a responsibility to inform family. But they haven't had contact, so is it hiding if they're not in communication? Also, the family might react negatively, especially since they're religious and the user is unmarried. The user is also worried about their child being exposed to that environment. \n\nLegally and morally, there's no obligation to maintain contact with family that's been abusive. The user's priority is their well-being and their child's. The family hasn't reached out positively; their communication is hostile. So, the user isn't hiding the pregnancy from an active relationship but from a toxic one. \n\nThe possible answer would be that they're not in the wrong because they're protecting themselves and their child from harm. They have a valid reason to avoid contact. The guilt might come from societal expectations, but their situation is unique. The key points are the history of abuse and lack of positive family interaction. So, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
