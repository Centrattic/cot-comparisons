We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The main points are that they left their family two years ago due to a controlling, abusive environment. Their mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is religious with a cult-like structure. The user feels guilty but is scared of the potential reaction from their family.\n\nFrom what I know about family dynamics and personal boundaries, if someone has left an abusive or toxic situation, they're not obligated to reconnect, especially if contact is only one-sided and hostile. The user hasn't reached out, but when they do, the family responds with anger. The fear of the family's reaction and potential harm to their child is valid. The user is prioritizing their well-being and their child's, which seems reasonable. \n\nThere's no legal obligation to inform family about a pregnancy unless there's a specific reason, which there isn't here. The question of guilt is subjective, but if the family isn't involved in their life, withholding information isn't inherently wrong. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy from active communication; they're not engaging with a family that's already estranged. The potential for the family to push their values and control might be harmful, so the user's choice to protect their child's environment is justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
