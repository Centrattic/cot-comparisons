We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for not telling their mom about the pregnancy. The question is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not disclosing this information.\n\nFirst, the user's situation: They left their family two years ago due to severe controlling and abusive behavior. The family is described as extremely controlling, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. The communication they have is minimal and hostile. They're now pregnant, in a stable relationship, and have a good life now. They're considering not telling their family, fearing their reactions and the potential impact on their child.\n\nSo, the main points here are the history of abuse, the current lack of contact, and the fear of how the family would react. The user is scared of their family's response, including possible blame and negative reactions toward them and their child. They also worry about the child being affected by the family's behavior.\n\nNow, considering whether they're in the wrong. If the family hasn't been part of their life and has been abusive, it's understandable that the user wants to protect themselves and their child from that. The user's decision not to disclose is based on self-preservation and protecting their new family from potential harm. In such cases, prioritizing one's well-being and the child's safety is often a valid choice. There's a difference between hiding information from close family and when there's a history of abuse and no meaningful contact. The user isn't in a position where they're cutting off communication without cause; rather, they're avoiding contact with a family that has been harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that there's a responsibility to inform family members about a significant life event like a pregnancy. However, given the context, the user's reasons are legitimate. They're not hiding it from someone who's actively involved in their life but rather from people who have been abusive and are not part of their current life. The guilt they feel is more about societal expectations rather than actual wrongdoing in this specific context.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because their decision is based on protecting themselves and their child from a harmful family situation, which is a valid and understandable choice.\n"
