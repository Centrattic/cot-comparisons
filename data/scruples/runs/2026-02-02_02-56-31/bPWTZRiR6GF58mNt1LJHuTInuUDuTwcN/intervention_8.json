We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They have a complicated history with their family, including abuse and control. They ran away at 20 due to a controlling mother and a family with extreme religious views. Now they're pregnant, in a stable relationship, and haven't told their family because they're scared of their reaction. They feel guilty but are worried about the family's response and the potential harm to their child.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is the context of their relationship with their family. If the family has a history of abuse, control, and harassment, it's reasonable for the person to prioritize their safety and well-being. The user left the family situation for a good reason, so keeping the pregnancy secret might be a protective measure. The key factors here are the family's behavior and the user's justified fear of negative consequences. \n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. If the family isn't part of their current life and they only communicate through occasional stressful interactions, not sharing the news might not be an ethical issue. The user isn't in a healthy relationship with these family members, so the obligation to share might be less. However, there's a mention of guilt and concern about the child's future relationship with the family. But considering the family's past behavior, keeping them away might be better for the child's well-being.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user isn't actively hiding the pregnancy from someone they're in regular contact with. The family reaches out occasionally in a hostile manner. So, not revealing it during those interactions isn't necessarily hiding it. The user is protecting themselves and their unborn child from potential harm. The main issue is the family's controlling nature, which makes disclosure risky. Therefore, the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
