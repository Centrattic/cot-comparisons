  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not telling my mom that I'm pregnant?\nI'm about 37 weeks pregnant but I still haven't told any of my biological family. We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is pregnant and hasn't told their biological family, who they haven't been in touch with for a while. The family is described as controlling, abusive, and part of a cult-like environment. The user is scared of how they might react, especially since they left due to abuse.\n\nFirst, the question is whether they're in the wrong for not telling. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the context. The family isn't in regular contact. The user left for valid reasons\u2014abuse and control. They haven't initiated contact, and when they do talk, it's hostile. Hiding a pregnancy could be seen as lying if they were in a regular communication, but here, they're not. The user is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. The fear is justified given the family's history. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should be notified, but the user's safety and the child's well-being are priorities. The question is about being in the wrong. Since the family isn't a supportive part of their life, not informing them isn't wrong. The user's decision is to protect themselves and their child from a toxic environment. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
