We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They haven't spoken to their family except for occasional texts that turn into screaming. The family was controlling and abusive, leading them to run away. Now they're married, have a stable life, and are pregnant.\n\nFirst, the key points: The family is described as abusive, controlling, and toxic. The person left home to escape that. They're not in contact, so not sharing the pregnancy isn't hiding it from active communication. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not informing their family.\n\nThe user is worried about guilt and potential reactions from family. They fear their family would react negatively, especially regarding being unmarried, and worry about how their child might be treated. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them, so it's their own choice.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider the context of the family dynamics. If the family is abusive, cutting off contact is often advised for the person's well-being. Not sharing personal news with an abusive family isn't necessarily wrong, especially if it protects both the individual and the child from potential harm. The person's safety and mental health are priorities here.\n\nAlso, the fact that they haven't been in contact for months and the rare texts are hostile means there's no ongoing relationship. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone they're in regular contact with. The decision to not inform the family could be seen as a necessary choice to protect themselves and their child from a harmful environment.\n\nSo, considering the abusive background, the lack of contact, and the potential risks, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The person is prioritizing their well-being and their child's future, which is a valid decision given the circumstances.\n"
