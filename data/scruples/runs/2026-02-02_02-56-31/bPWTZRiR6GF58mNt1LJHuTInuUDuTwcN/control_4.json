We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author didn't tell her family about her pregnancy, and they haven't been in contact much. The family is described as controlling, abusive, and manipulative. She ran away at 20 because of their behavior. Her mom is a narcissist, and the family is part of a cult-like group with extreme religious values. They controlled her life, checked her car mileage, her bank account, and invaded her privacy. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and the lack of communication. The author is scared of their reaction, knowing they might blame her, attack her for being unmarried, and potentially harm her child. The boyfriend hasn't pushed her to tell them, but she's feeling conflicted.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The main factors to consider are the well-being of the author and the child, the history of abuse, and the nature of her relationship with her family. If the family is toxic and abusive, keeping the pregnancy secret could be a protective measure. The author is not in a good situation with her family, so prioritizing her safety and her child's safety is important. \n\nThe concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often hinges on social norms and expectations, but in this case, the family's behavior is severe. The author is in a vulnerable position, and choosing not to share the news to avoid harm isn't necessarily wrong. She hasn't ignored them entirely\u2014there are occasional texts, but they're hostile. The family's reaction could be dangerous, both emotionally and possibly physically, given their past behavior. \n\nAdditionally, the author is considering the child's future. She's worried about the child being treated the same way she was. This shows she's thinking about the child's well-being, which is a positive factor. The decision not to inform the family might be in the best interest of both herself and her child. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should be informed, but this is a scenario where the family isn't a supportive one. The author has every right to protect herself and her child from potential abuse or manipulation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's making a decision based on protecting herself and her child from a harmful environment. The family's behavior justifies her hesitation and decision to not inform them.\n"
