We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed. They ran away from home two years ago because of a controlling, abusive family. The mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They're religious and controlling. The user is now pregnant, in a happy relationship with their boyfriend, and hasn't told their family.\n\nSo the main question is whether not telling their family about the pregnancy makes them at fault. They feel guilty but also scared of the reaction. They worry about their baby not meeting the other side of the family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user's family has a history of abuse and control. The user left because of that. The family hasn't been supportive; their contact is minimal and hostile. Given that, the user is protecting themselves from potential harm. The child's safety is also a concern. If the family is abusive, exposing the child to them could be harmful. So from a self-protection and child protection standpoint, not informing them might be a reasonable decision.\n\nThe user mentions feeling guilty because they haven't spoken in months. But if the family hasn't reached out except to scream, maybe the responsibility isn't on the user to keep them updated. The user's priority is their safety and their child's safety. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them, which is good. The user is also considering the child's future, fearing the family might treat the child the same way they did. That's a valid concern.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is the user at fault? Well, in a normal, healthy family, keeping such a big life event from parents might be considered wrong. But the context here is an abusive family. The user isn't avoiding communication out of spite but out of necessity for their well-being. The user's actions are self-preservation and protecting their child. So, in this context, not telling the family isn't in the wrong. The answer would likely be B, they're not in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the user's family initiated contact with hostile messages. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy per se; they're not sharing it because they know the consequences. The user's boyfriend hasn't pushed for disclosure, so the pressure isn't external. The user's fear is justified given past experiences. Also, the user is setting boundaries to protect themselves and their child, which is a healthy step. Therefore, it's not their fault for not telling.\n"
