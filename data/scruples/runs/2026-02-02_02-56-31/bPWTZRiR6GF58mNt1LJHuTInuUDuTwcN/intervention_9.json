  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not telling my mom that I'm pregnant?\nI'm about 37 weeks pregnant but I still haven't told any of my biological family. We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They have a complicated history with their family, involving control, abuse, and being on bad terms. They left home at 20, found a stable life, and now are pregnant with their partner's child. The boyfriend hasn't pushed them to tell the family, but they feel conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The family hasn't been supportive, controlling, and abusive. The user is protecting themselves from potential negative reactions. The mother is described as narcissistic, and the family is controlling and religious. The user fears the family's reaction, possible blame, and the impact on their child.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family members about one's pregnancy unless there are custody or other legal implications, which aren't mentioned here. Ethically, it's about the user's right to make decisions for their life and child, especially given the past trauma. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone they're in regular contact with; the family only reaches out to criticize. The user is prioritizing their well-being and their child's future, which is valid.\n\nThe key points are the history of abuse, the family's current relationship, and the potential harm from informing them. The user isn't in a position where they owe them information if the family hasn't maintained a healthy relationship. The fear of the child being exposed to negative influences is also a valid concern. So, the answer would likely be that they're not in the wrong (B), as they're protecting themselves and their child from a harmful environment.\n"
