We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is that she's 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told any family, and they only contact her occasionally to yell. She ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family. Now she's with a boyfriend and is happy but feels conflicted about telling her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The family is described as controlling, abusive, and part of a cult-like environment. The user is protecting herself from potential harm by not disclosing the pregnancy. The question is whether she's in the wrong for keeping it secret.\n\nThe options are A (she is in the wrong) or B (she is not). From the description, the family has a history of mental abuse, invading her privacy, and being hostile. If she tells them, they might react negatively, possibly harm her or the child. The user isn't hiding it from a relationship but from estranged family who aren't part of her life. She also mentions fearing their judgment about being unmarried and possibly mistreating her child. \n\nIn such cases, it's often about personal safety and well-being. Keeping the pregnancy secret from an abusive family could be a protective measure. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but her situation is complex. The fact that she's with a supportive partner and has built a stable life suggests she's not hiding from the relationship but from a harmful environment.\n\nThe main factors here are the family's abusive behavior, her right to autonomy, and the child's well-being. Since the family isn't part of her life and could pose a threat, it's reasonable that she doesn't want to involve them. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her safety and the child's future. The answer is B.\n"
