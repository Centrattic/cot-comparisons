We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. They have a history of a very controlling, abusive family, especially the mom being a narcissist and the grandfather running the family like a cult. They ran away at 20 and are now in a stable, happy relationship and have a baby on the way. They're worried about telling their family because of the potential negative reactions\u2014maybe they'll be criticized for being unmarried, or worse, that the baby might be affected by the family's toxic behavior.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong for not telling their family. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family wasn't supportive, was abusive and controlling. The person left to escape that environment. Maintaining contact with such a family can be harmful, not just to the individual but also to the child. The person's priorities are the well-being of their child and themselves. The family hasn't been in contact except for hostile texts. The mother's side might react negatively to the pregnancy, especially if they're religious and judgmental.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the family isn't part of the person's life and has shown no support, then keeping the pregnancy private isn't hiding\u2014it's protecting both themselves and their child from potential harm. The person isn't obligated to maintain relationships that are toxic. The fear of the family's reaction and the potential harm to the child are valid reasons not to disclose. The family isn't in a position to claim that they haven't been told because they haven't been involved. The person isn't avoiding responsibility here; they're making a choice based on their past experiences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (not in the wrong). The person has every right to prioritize their safety and their child's well-being over a family that's been harmful. There's no obligation to inform people who have a history of abuse. The guilt might stem from societal expectations, but in this case, it's about protecting themselves and their child from further trauma.\n"
