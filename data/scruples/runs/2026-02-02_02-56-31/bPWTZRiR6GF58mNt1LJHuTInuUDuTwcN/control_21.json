We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. So, the main points from the situation are that the author is 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her biological family, and they haven't been on speaking terms except for rare, hostile texts. She ran away from home two years ago due to a controlling and abusive family environment. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious and controlling, even to the point of monitoring her every move. Now she's in a stable situation with a boyfriend and a new life.\n\nThe author is conflicted because she feels guilty but is terrified of how her family would react. She's worried they'll accuse her of hiding the pregnancy, call her names for being unmarried, and that the family might harm her child by exposing her to the same treatment. She's considering not telling them at all, which makes her wonder if she's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author has a moral or ethical obligation to inform her family. The family hasn't been in contact except for hostile messages, so from her perspective, there's no active relationship. The user is asking if she's at fault for not sharing the news with people who are not part of her life anymore. \n\nThe key factors here are the prior relationship's health and the potential consequences. Since the family was abusive, controlling, and she left to escape that environment, it's understandable that she wants to protect herself and her child from similar treatment. The family's last interactions were negative, and they haven't been involved in her life. In such cases, the responsibility to inform might depend on the existing relationship. If they're not part of her life, she might not have an obligation to update them, especially if it's harmful to do so.\n\nAdditionally, the author is considering the child's future. She's worried that if the family meets the child, they might subject her to the same upbringing. This shows the author's concern for her child's well-being, which is a valid reason to avoid contact. Protecting her child from potential abuse or manipulation is a strong ethical stance.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family has a right to know about her child, especially if there's a possibility of future contact. However, given the toxic history and the author's current safety and the child's, it's more about prioritizing her well-being. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from people she's in regular contact with; she's not sharing it with people who have been absent and hostile. The responsibility to inform is usually higher when there's an ongoing, healthy relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a decision to protect herself and her child from a harmful family dynamic. The guilt might come from societal expectations about family obligations, but her circumstances are unique and valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
