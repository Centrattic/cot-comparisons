We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a woman who is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They haven't been in contact except for occasional texts where the family screams at her. She ran away at 20 to escape an abusive, controlling environment with a narcissistic mother and a cult-like grandfather. She's now in a stable relationship and is pregnant.\n\nShe's conflicted because she feels guilty for not telling them, but she's scared of their reaction. She doesn't want her child to be exposed to the same treatment she received. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The user has a right to protect herself and her child from potential abuse or negative influence. The family has a history of control and abuse, so contacting them might risk harm. The user isn't in contact with them, so it's not like she's ignoring a close relationship. She's not hiding it from someone who's actively part of her life.\n\nBut some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild, even if the relationship is strained. However, the user's priority is the well-being of her and her child. The family's previous behavior justifies her decision to stay silent. Also, since the family hasn't been part of her life, withholding information isn't exactly hiding it from active family members.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform estranged family of a pregnancy. Emotionally, she's doing what's best for her and her child. The guilt she feels is understandable but not necessarily justified given the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's protecting herself and her child from potential harm, which is a valid reason to not disclose the pregnancy.\n"
