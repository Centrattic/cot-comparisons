  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not telling my mom that I'm pregnant?\nI'm about 37 weeks pregnant but I still haven't told any of my biological family. We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family, which she's not on good terms with. She ran away two years ago because of a controlling, abusive family environment. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They're extremely religious and controlling. She left home, found her own job, home, boyfriend, and now a baby. The boyfriend hasn't pushed her to tell the family, but she's feeling torn. She's scared of their reaction, potential judgment, and how they might treat her baby. She's worried about the baby growing up not knowing her family or facing the same treatment. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse and control by the family, the emotional trauma, and the current situation of being pregnant. The user is prioritizing her own safety and her child's well-being by not involving the family. The family isn't being supportive; instead, they're hostile and invasive. The user hasn't been in contact, so maybe she's not obligated to inform them. Also, considering the potential harm from their reaction, it's a protective measure.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might say family should be informed about a grandchild. But in cases of abuse and toxicity, the priority shifts to the individual's well-being and their child's. The user is in a stable situation with her partner, so the decision not to involve her family is more about protecting herself and her baby. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for choosing to keep it private. The answer should be B.\n"
