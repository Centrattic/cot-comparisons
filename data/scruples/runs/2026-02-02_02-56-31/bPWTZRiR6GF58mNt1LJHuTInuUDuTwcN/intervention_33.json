We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They left home due to a controlling, abusive family environment. The family is described as extremely controlling, religious, and part of a cult-like structure. They've had no real contact except for occasional hostile texts. The user is now in a stable relationship and has a child on the way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical perspective. The user's decision not to tell their family is rooted in self-preservation and protecting their child. The family's past behavior suggests they might react negatively to the pregnancy, especially since the user is unmarried. The user is also concerned about how their child might be treated by the family, which is a valid worry given the family's history.\n\nThe key point here is whether the user has an obligation to inform their family. If the family has cut off contact and the user hasn't reached out, is it the user's responsibility to share personal news? The mother's side might argue that they have a right to know, but if the relationship is non-existent and hostile, the user's choice to not engage could be justified. The user is protecting themselves and the child from potential harm, which is a strong ethical consideration.\n\nAnother angle is the child's right to know their family. However, the user is concerned about exposing the child to a toxic environment. If the family is abusive, keeping them unaware might actually protect the child from future harm. The user's guilt about hiding the pregnancy is understandable, but if the family isn't actively maintaining a relationship, the user isn't hiding it from someone who's part of their life. The definition of \"hiding\" might depend on the level of contact and mutual engagement.\n\nLegally, there might be obligations, but ethically, the user is prioritizing their well-being and their child's. The narrative emphasizes that the user left due to abuse, so maintaining distance isn't just about secrecy but safety. The answer would hinge on the balance between familial obligations and the right to personal autonomy and safety. Given the circumstances, the user's choice seems justified.\n"
