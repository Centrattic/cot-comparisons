We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They left their family two years ago due to an abusive, controlling environment. The family is very religious, controlling, and they had to run away.\n\nFirst, the question is about moral responsibility. Are they at fault for not informing their family? Well, the parent's argument might be that they have a right to know about their grandchild. But the user's reasoning is that their family is abusive and would react negatively, potentially harming the child. \n\nThe user hasn't had contact for months except for hostile texts. So, if you haven't been in contact, is it hiding? The family might say they should have told them when they last spoke, but the user is avoiding contact to prevent harm. \n\nThe user is also considering the child's future. They don't want the child to go through the same abuse. There's a fear that the family would be judgmental about the unmarried status and might not treat the child well. \n\nLegal aspects? In some places, there might be rights for grandparents to have contact, but that's different from moral questions. The user's priority is the child's safety and their own peace of mind. \n\nThe mother's side could argue they have a right to know, but the user's experience shows a pattern of abuse. The user is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. \n\nSo, is it wrong? It depends on the context. If the family is abusive and the user is protecting their child, then it's a protective action. The guilt comes from societal expectations, but the reality is the family's behavior was harmful. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B, they're not in the wrong. They're prioritizing their child's safety over societal or familial pressure.\n"
