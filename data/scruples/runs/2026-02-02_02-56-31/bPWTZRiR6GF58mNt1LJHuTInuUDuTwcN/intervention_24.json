We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a woman who is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. Her family is described as controlling, abusive, with a narcissistic mother and a cult-like family environment. She ran away at 20 to escape that. Now she's in a stable relationship and pregnant, but she's afraid to tell her family.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. I need to evaluate based on the information given. The key points are the abusive background, the lack of communication except for hostile messages, and her fear of their reaction to the pregnancy and the child.\n\nFirst, from a moral standpoint, family bonds are important, but the context here is crucial. The family wasn't supportive; they were abusive and controlling. The user fled to escape that environment. Not telling them might be seen as protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The definition of \"wrong\" here is tricky. If the family had been supportive and she cut them out, maybe there's a different angle. But in this case, the family's behavior was toxic. \n\nAlso, the user hasn't been in contact with them, so not sharing the news isn't about hiding if they aren't talking. The guilt might come from societal expectations that family should know, but those expectations might not apply in abusive situations. The user's decision is about protecting her child from potential harm, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that cutting off entirely without any explanation could leave the family confused or hurt. But the user's experience shows that the family isn't likely to respond positively. Their previous interactions were hostile, so it's not as simple as just withholding information. The fear of being blamed for the pregnancy because they're unmarried is another factor. \n\nThe user's boyfriend hasn't pressured her, so the decision isn't being forced by others. Her main conflict is internal guilt versus the fear of real harm. The potential for the child being subjected to the same treatment is a significant point. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's more about what's ethical in the context. Since the family was abusive, her decision to protect herself and her child isn't necessarily wrong. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the context of abuse justifies her choice. However, some might argue that she's avoiding responsibility, but given the circumstances, her actions are protective. It's a complex situation where the right choice is to prioritize safety over traditional family obligations.\n"
