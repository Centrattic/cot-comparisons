We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The user is a woman who is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. She had a really bad experience with them in the past, including abuse and control. She ran away at 20. Now she's in a stable relationship and having a child. The main question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling her family about the pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Her family is described as controlling, abusive, and pushing their religious values. They have a history of invading her privacy and reacting negatively. She hasn't been in contact with them except for occasional texts where they end up yelling at her. She's not in contact with them and fears their reaction if she tells them. She's worried they'll criticize her for being unmarried and might harm her child.\n\nThe user is feeling guilty because she hasn't told them, but she's terrified of their reaction. She also fears her child might be affected by meeting them. The dilemma is whether she's in the wrong for keeping her pregnancy a secret from her family.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, if the family was abusive and controlling, she might have a valid reason to cut contact. Parents can't force someone to maintain a relationship, especially if it's harmful. Also, the user is making a choice to protect herself and her child from potential harm. The fact that her family has a history of abuse and control suggests that not telling them might be a protective measure.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family relationships are important, and cutting off completely could be seen as abandoning family. But in cases of abuse, many people prioritize their own safety and their child's well-being. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy from people who are actively involved in their life; she's not in contact with them to begin with. So, maybe it's not hiding but rather choosing not to engage with harmful family members.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse, the lack of current contact, the fear of negative reactions, and the protection of the child. The user is prioritizing her own and her child's safety, which is a common and understandable decision. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's protecting herself from a harmful situation.\n"
