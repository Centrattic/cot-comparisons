We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The situation is complex. The author ran away from home due to a controlling, abusive family environment. The parents are described as narcissistic and part of a religious cult-like family. The author hasn't spoken to them much except for occasional texts that turn into arguments.\n\nThe key points here are the family's behavior towards the author. They were controlling and abusive, invading privacy, controlling finances, etc. The author left to escape that. Now, they're pregnant and worried about how the family would react. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell, but the author is conflicted. They fear the family's reaction, potential judgment, and the impact on their child if the family gets involved.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not informing their family. In typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenarios, it's about social norms and expectations. However, in this case, the family isn't part of the author's current life. They haven't maintained contact, and the author has a valid reason to avoid them due to the toxic environment. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from people who are present in their life but is choosing not to inform estranged family members who have been harmful. \n\nSociety generally expects family members to know about significant life events, but if the family has been abusive and the author is protecting both themselves and their child from potential harm, that's a strong defense. The author isn't cutting off communication entirely out of spite but is prioritizing their well-being and their child's. The guilt might come from societal pressure, but the circumstances make the decision understandable.\n\nSo, considering the family's history of abuse and the author's efforts to distance themselves for their own and their child's safety, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
