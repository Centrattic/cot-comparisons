We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is pregnant and hasn't told her biological family, who she's not on speaking terms with. They only contact her occasionally and end up yelling. She ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family. Now she's with a partner and wants to protect her child from the same treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points are the family's behavior, her reasons for not contacting them, and the potential impact on her child. The family has a history of abuse and control. She left because of this, and they haven't been in a healthy relationship since. Hiding the pregnancy might be a protective measure. But she feels guilty about not telling them. However, the family hasn't reached out in a positive way; their texts are confrontational. The guilt might be from societal expectations rather than her family's actions. Also, the child's well-being is a concern, but she's worried the family would harm the child's mental health. \n\nIn such situations, the priority is the safety and well-being of the mother and child. If the family is toxic, not contacting them is reasonable. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who's actively involved in her life but is avoiding a harmful situation. Ethically, it's about protecting oneself and the child from potential harm. So, she's not in the wrong for choosing not to tell them, especially if it's to prevent abuse. The answer is likely B.\n"
