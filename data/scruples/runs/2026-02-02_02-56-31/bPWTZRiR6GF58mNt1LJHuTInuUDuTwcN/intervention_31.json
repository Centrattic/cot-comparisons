We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. The family has a history of being very controlling, abusive, and part of a cult-like structure. The user ran away at 20 due to this environment. Now, they're terrified of sharing the pregnancy because they know the family would react negatively, possibly with accusations, harassment, and pushing religious values. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them, but the user feels conflicted about whether they're hiding the pregnancy. They're worried about the baby's future interactions with the family and potential mistreatment.\n\nFirst, the user's reasons for not telling the family are rooted in safety and past trauma. They've experienced mental abuse and control, which is serious. Parents who are narcissistic and abusive can indeed be harmful, and cutting off contact might be a necessary step for the person's well-being. The fear of the baby being mistreated is valid, especially in a family that's controlling and judgmental about things like being unmarried. The user's priority is to protect both themselves and their child from further harm.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong for not disclosing. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From a standpoint of personal safety and autonomy, the user has the right to make decisions that protect their health and their child's. The family's behavior is toxic, and the user isn't obligated to maintain contact if it's harmful. The fact that the family hasn't been in touch except for hostile messages means there's no current relationship to maintain. So, not telling them isn't hiding something in a healthy relationship context. The user's choice is about self-preservation and their child's well-being. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
