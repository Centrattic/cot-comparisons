We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty complex. They had a really bad experience with their family, leaving home at 20 due to control and abuse. Now they're pregnant with their partner's child and haven't told their family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's family is described as controlling, abusive, and has a toxic dynamic. They haven't been in contact except for rare texts where the family members get angry. The user is scared of how the family would react if told about the pregnancy. The main question is whether not telling them makes the user \"in the wrong.\"\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the user's decision is influenced by their past trauma. They're choosing to protect themselves and their unborn child from potential harm. Family obligations sometimes come into play, but when the family is abusive, those obligations might not be as strong. The user is prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being, which is a valid consideration.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family relationships. The user might feel guilty for not informing their mom, especially if the mother claims it's a family matter. But given the history, the user's fear is justified. They\u2019re not cutting off contact completely but have a strained relationship. The mother's potential reaction could be negative, especially regarding the user being unmarried and having a child with someone they love. The user is worried about the baby being affected by the family's possible treatment, which adds another layer of concern.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's hard to say. The user is making a choice based on their lived experience. They\u2019re not hiding the pregnancy in a vacuum; they\u2019re avoiding contact with a family that has a history of abuse. The ethical dilemma here is balancing familial obligations against self-preservation and child protection. Since the family hasn't been supportive, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for not sharing the news. They have valid reasons rooted in their past experiences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong). The user's actions are a form of self-protection and protecting their child from a harmful environment, which is a valid reason to withhold information.\n"
