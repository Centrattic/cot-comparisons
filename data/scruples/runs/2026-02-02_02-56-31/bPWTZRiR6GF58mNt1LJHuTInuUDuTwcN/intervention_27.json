We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They have a complicated relationship with their family. They ran away because of controlling and abusive parents. The family is very controlling, religious, and they don't want their child to go through the same. The user is scared of the reaction and the potential harm to their baby.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if they're in the wrong. The key points here are the history of abuse and the current relationship status. The user hasn't been in contact with their family except for rare, hostile messages. The family's behavior is described as toxic, which is a valid reason to cut off contact. \n\nIs there an obligation to inform family about a pregnancy? Well, if the family hasn't been part of the user's life and they've chosen to distance themselves for safety and well-being, maybe not. The user is protecting themselves and their future child from potential harm. The guilt comes from societal expectations, but the user's situation is unique. \n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured them, which suggests the decision is personal. The user's fear is about the family's reaction\u2014judgment, harassment, possible negative influence on the child. These are valid concerns. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about the user's right to protect their family and autonomy. If the family isn't supportive or safe, it's reasonable to not involve them. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy from close family; they've just chosen to distance themselves from toxic relatives. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The user isn't at fault for prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being. They have a legitimate reason to avoid contact. The answer should reflect understanding of their situation and validate their choice without judgment.\n"
