We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the family history: she ran away at 20 because of a controlling, abusive environment. The parents are described as narcissistic and part of a cult-like family with extreme religious views. They were invading her privacy, controlling her finances, and isolating her. That's serious abuse. The user left and built a life with a supportive boyfriend.\n\nNow, she's pregnant and hasn't told her family. The question is whether she's in the wrong for keeping it secret. The key points here are the reason for not telling them. She's not hiding the pregnancy from someone who's part of her life; she hasn't spoken to them in a long time, and their interactions are hostile. The last time they contacted her, it was to scream at her. She's worried about their reaction, which might include criticism for being unmarried and potential harm to her child.\n\nThe ethical angle here is about the duty to inform family vs. self-preservation. Since the family has been abusive and there's no current relationship, is there an obligation to keep them updated? Also, the child's right to know their family vs. the risk of harmful exposure.\n\nIn similar cases, people often aren't in the wrong if they're protecting themselves from abusive situations. The author's decision to not engage with her family is a form of self-care. The family's behavior doesn't create a right to information about her life. Plus, she's considering her child's safety, which adds another layer of justification.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No), because she's protecting herself and her child from a harmful family environment. There's no obligation to maintain contact with people who've been abusive, and her choice isn't based on keeping a secret from a functioning relationship but avoiding contact with abusers.\n"
