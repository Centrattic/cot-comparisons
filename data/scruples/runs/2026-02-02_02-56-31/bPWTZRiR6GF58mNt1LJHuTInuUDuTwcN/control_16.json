We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They don't speak except for occasional texts where they get screamed at for leaving. The family is described as controlling, mentally abusive, with a narcissistic mom and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. The user ran away at 20 due to this environment. She's now in a stable situation with a job, home, and a happy relationship. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell the family. She feels guilty but is scared of how they'll react, and worried about her baby being treated similarly.\n\nSo, the key points here are the family's history of abuse, control, and pushing their values. The user left because of that. She's pregnant but doesn't want to risk her child being exposed to the same environment. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nFirst, the idea of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) usually hinges on whether the person acted unethically or wrongfully. The author's reasoning is based on self-protection and protecting her child from a harmful environment. She's not in contact with her family except for occasional aggressive texts. She hasn't hidden the pregnancy from them because they don't communicate. The guilt comes from the fact that maybe they would consider her hiding it, but given their history, she's making a choice that's best for her and her child.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform estranged family members about a pregnancy. Ethically, it's more about the well-being of the child and the mother. If the family is abusive and controlling, not involving them could be seen as protecting the child from potential harm. The author isn't cutting off contact out of spite but due to past trauma. The fear of the family's reaction and potential negative impact on the child's life supports her decision.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the child has a right to know her family, but if the family is toxic, that right might be outweighed by the need for a safe environment. The author's decision is based on her experiences and knowledge of the family's behavior, which are legitimate concerns.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is a protective measure based on past experiences, and there's no obligation to maintain contact with harmful family members. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
