We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author left her family two years ago because they were controlling and abusive. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult with extreme religious views. They controlled her life in various ways, like checking her car mileage, controlling her bank account, and invading her privacy. She ran away, got a job, a home, a boyfriend, and now is pregnant.\n\nShe's 37 weeks along and hasn't told her family. They don't speak except for rare texts that turn into screaming matches. The question is if she's in the wrong for not telling them. The author feels guilty but is scared of their reaction. She's worried they'll accuse her of hiding it, call her names, and that her child might later resent her for not letting the other family meet them. But she's also afraid of how they might treat her child.\n\nSo, from what I can gather, the author has a history of abuse and control from her family. She's protecting herself and her unborn child from potential harm. The main factors here are the safety and well-being of both the author and the child. The family hasn't been supportive; in fact, their interactions are hostile. The author isn't in contact with them, so not telling them isn't about deception in an ongoing relationship but about avoiding negative consequences from a toxic family.\n\nThe key points here are the intent to protect herself and her child from an abusive environment. The author isn't keeping the pregnancy a secret from a family that she's in regular contact with; rather, she's cutting off contact with a family that has shown no support. The sense of obligation to inform family is usually stronger when there's a positive relationship. Here, the relationship is toxic, so her decision to not inform them isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B, No.\n"
