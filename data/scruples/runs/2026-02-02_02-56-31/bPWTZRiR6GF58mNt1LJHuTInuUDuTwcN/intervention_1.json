We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a woman who is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. The family isn't in regular contact; they only reach out to her occasionally in a hostile manner. She ran away from home two years ago due to a controlling, abusive environment. Her mother is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. She's now in a stable, happy relationship and is pregnant.\n\nShe's feeling guilty about not telling her family, but she's scared of their reaction. She's worried they'll accuse her of hiding it, call her names, and that they might harm her child by exposing her to the same treatment she endured. The question is whether she's in the wrong (AITA) for not informing them.\n\nFirst, consider the dynamics. The family isn't on speaking terms with her except for hostile texts. She hasn't contacted them; they do. That suggests a one-sided relationship where communication isn't healthy. The user has left the family environment due to abuse, which is a valid reason for not wanting to reconnect.\n\nThe key here is the nature of the relationship. If the family is toxic and the user is protecting herself and her child from potential harm, withholding information might be a form of self-preservation. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations that family should be informed about a new family member, but if the family isn't supportive or has a history of abuse, those expectations don't apply here.\n\nAlso, the child's well-being is a concern. The user is worried about the child being subjected to the same treatment. It's a valid fear given the family's past behavior. By not revealing the pregnancy, she might be protecting the child from future harm.\n\nThe answer hinges on the quality of the relationship. If there's no healthy communication and the family is abusive, the user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her safety and her child's. The responsibility isn't on her to maintain a toxic relationship. The guilt she feels could be misplaced if the family isn't providing a safe environment.\n\nAnother angle: the user hasn't hidden the pregnancy from her boyfriend, which is a supportive partner. The decision not to tell the family is likely influenced by her past experiences. There's no obligation to inform people who have been harmful. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because she's protecting herself and her child from potential abuse.\n"
