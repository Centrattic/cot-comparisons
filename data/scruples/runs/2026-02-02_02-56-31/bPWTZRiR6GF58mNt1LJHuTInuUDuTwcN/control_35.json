We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author left home two years ago because of a very controlling and abusive family. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. They monitored her every move, checked her car mileage, controlled her bank account, and invaded her privacy. That's a lot. She ran away, found a stable job, a home, and is now pregnant with her boyfriend's child. She hasn't told her family, and she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the family's past behavior. If the family was abusive and controlling, then keeping this information from them might be a protective measure for herself and her future child. The author is scared of their reaction, possible harassment, judgment about being unmarried, and how they might treat her baby. She also mentions guilt for hiding it, but she hasn't had real contact with them, just occasional texts that turn into screaming.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the family isn't part of her life and has been harmful, then not informing them could be a reasonable choice. The question is about being in the \"wrong.\" Typically, people have a responsibility to their immediate family, but if the family is not supportive and has a history of abuse, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being. Also, the fact that she hasn't been in meaningful contact with them might mean there's no expectation for her to share major life events with them. The fear of negative consequences for her child is another point in her favor.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not telling the family could be seen as hiding, especially if they were part of her life before. But given the context of abuse and control, it's more about self-preservation. The author is in a vulnerable position, and it's reasonable to protect herself and the baby from potential harm. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which suggests he supports her decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice to protect herself from a harmful environment, and there's a valid reason for not disclosing the pregnancy to a family that's not supportive and has a history of abuse.\n"
