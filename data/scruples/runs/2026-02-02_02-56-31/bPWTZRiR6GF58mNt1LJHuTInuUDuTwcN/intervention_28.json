We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family, who they're not in a good relationship with. They ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family environment. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. The person is now in a stable relationship and has a child, but they're conflicted about whether they're in the wrong for not telling their family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family relationship. The user mentions that the family isn't on speaking terms except for occasional texts that turn into yelling. They left because of abuse and control, so the dynamic is already strained. The question is whether not telling them about the pregnancy makes them at fault.\n\nOn one hand, some might argue that family should be informed about such a significant life event. But the key here is the nature of the relationship. If the family is abusive and controlling, withholding information to protect oneself and the child could be seen as a reasonable choice. The user is prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being, which is a valid concern. There's also the fear that the family might react negatively, which is understandable given past experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the user feels guilt about hiding the pregnancy. However, if the family isn't supportive and has a history of abuse, it's not hiding but rather a decision to protect. The user hasn't been the one reaching out; it's the family that contacts them. So, in terms of responsibility, if the family hasn't maintained a healthy relationship, the onus isn't entirely on the user to inform them.\n\nAlso, considering the child's future, the user is worried about the family's treatment. If the family is toxic, it's in the child's best interest not to be exposed to that environment. The user is making a choice based on their knowledge of their family's behavior, which is a responsible decision.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user isn't at fault for choosing to protect themselves and their child from an abusive situation. The family's actions in the past have created a situation where the user feels justified in withholding information. The guilt they feel might be a natural emotional response, but it doesn't equate to being in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, they aren't in the wrong) because the decision is based on protecting themselves and their child from a harmful family dynamic.\n"
