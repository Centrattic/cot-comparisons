We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They have a complicated relationship with their family, especially their mom, who's described as a narcissist and part of a controlling, religious family. The user ran away from home at 20 due to abuse and now lives independently. They're 37 weeks pregnant, haven't told their family. The boyfriend hasn't pushed them to, but they feel conflicted.\n\nThe core question is whether they're at fault for not sharing. The family only contacts them to scream, and the user hasn't initiated contact. They're scared of the reaction, potential judgment about being unmarried, and fear their baby might be affected by meeting these family members. The user is worried about the baby being raised in the same environment they had.\n\nI need to evaluate the situation. The family is not supportive, and the user has valid reasons for avoiding contact. They left an abusive environment. The family's behavior is toxic, so withholding information might be a protective measure. The user's decision to not tell them now might be to protect their child from the same treatment. The guilt comes from feeling it's a secret, but if the family isn't part of their life, maybe it's not a secret. The key points are the abusive environment, lack of communication from the user, and the potential harm from family involvement.\n\nIn most cases, when someone is in a situation like this, especially with non-supportive or abusive family, it's understandable not to share personal news. The user is prioritizing their well-being and their child's. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the family isn't part of their life, and the user is protecting themselves and the child from harm. The guilt might be misplaced here, as the family isn't maintaining a healthy relationship. The user isn't obligated to share if the family isn't a supportive part of their life.\n"
