We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who's 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. The family isn't on speaking terms except for occasional texts that turn into yelling. The family is described as controlling and abusive, with the mother being narcissistic and a religiously strict household. The person ran away at 20 because of this, found a stable life, a partner, and now a child.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong for not telling their family. So, the key points here are the family's behavior and the author's reasons for not telling. The family isn't in regular contact; they reach out minimally and it's hostile. The author has a history of abuse and control, which makes them fear telling the family about the pregnancy. They're worried about the family's reaction, potential harassment, and the child being affected negatively by the family's influence.\n\nThe concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) usually hinges on whether the person acted wrongly despite having valid reasons. In this case, the author's decision to not contact their family is based on legitimate fears stemming from a history of abuse. The family hasn't been supportive or nurturing; instead, they've been controlling and hostile. The author is prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being, which is understandable. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's not in the author's wrong to withhold information if doing so protects them and their child from harm. The family's actions were the initial problem, creating a toxic environment. The author isn't obligated to share personal news with people who have been harmful. The boyfriend isn't pressuring them, which adds to the idea that the decision is the author's to make without external pressure.\n\nPotential counterarguments might suggest that family has a right to know about a grandchild, but given the context of abuse, this right seems less important than the author's and child's well-being. The family's history of invasion of privacy and control indicates they wouldn't respect the child's needs either. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's choice not to tell their family isn't in the wrong. They're making a self-protective decision based on past experiences. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
