We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is pregnant and hasn't told their biological family, who they aren't close with. Their family is described as controlling, abusive, and religious. They left home at 20 due to the abuse. Now they're scared of the reaction if they tell them about the pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Are they obligated to inform family they don't talk to? The user hasn't been in contact except for rare texts that turn into arguments. If the family hasn't been part of their life for years, maybe there's no obligation. But some might argue that as a parent, they have a responsibility to the child, even if they don't want to contact their own parents. However, the user is worried about the family's reaction and the potential harm to their child.\n\nOn the other hand, the user has the right to protect themselves and their child from abuse and control. The family's history includes invasion of privacy, controlling behavior, and possible harm. If they told the family, would that put the child at risk? The user's priority is to ensure the child isn't subjected to the same treatment.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong for not telling. If the family isn't part of their life and has been harmful, it's reasonable to avoid contact to protect both themselves and the child. The user is also considering the child's future, which is a valid concern. There's no legal obligation to inform non-custodial family members about a pregnancy unless there are specific circumstances, but that's a different angle.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the user has a moral obligation to family they've cut off for their own well-being. Since the user made the choice to leave an abusive environment and is now in a healthy relationship, their decision not to involve the family might be justified. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
