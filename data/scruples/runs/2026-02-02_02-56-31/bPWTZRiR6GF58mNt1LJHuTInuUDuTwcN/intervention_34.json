We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They have a history of a controlling, abusive family. They ran away because of the abuse and now have a stable life with their partner. They're scared of how their family will react if they find out. The question is whether they're in the wrong for keeping it a secret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is described as controlling, abusive, and toxic. The person has cut ties for their well-being. The mother is a narcissist, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They left because of abuse, so their current situation is about protecting themselves.\n\nNot telling the family could be seen as hiding, but the person hasn't been in contact with them. The family only reaches out to criticize. If you're not in a relationship where you're sharing updates, keeping a pregnancy secret might not be the same as hiding it from someone you're close to. The person is protecting their child from potential abuse and their own mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family has a right to know, but in this case, the family isn't providing support. The person's choice is about safety. The guilt they feel might be from societal expectations, but their circumstances are extreme. Deciding not to tell could be a protective measure, not a wrong one.\n\nSo, considering the abuse history and the lack of a healthy relationship, the answer is likely B (they're not in the wrong). They're prioritizing their child's and their own well-being over a toxic family dynamic.\n"
