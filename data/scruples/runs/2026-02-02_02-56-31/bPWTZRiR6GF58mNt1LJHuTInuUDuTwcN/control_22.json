We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family, who they aren't close with. The family is described as controlling, abusive, and religious. The user left home because of this. They haven't contacted the family, only the family contacts them, and those interactions are negative.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) for not telling their mom about the pregnancy. The options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the relationship. The family is not on speaking terms, and the mother is a narcissist with a controlling family. The author left due to abuse. In such cases, it's common for people to cut off toxic family members. \n\nThe author hasn't hidden the pregnancy from the family if they don't communicate. The family hasn't reached out in a long time, so not updating them isn't necessarily hiding. The author's fear is about the potential negative reaction from the family, including blame and judgment, and also worrying about how they might treat the child. \n\nIn many cases, people are not obligated to maintain relationships with family that have been abusive or neglectful. The author's decision to protect themselves and their child from potential harm makes sense. The fact that the boyfriend hasn't pressured them suggests he supports their decision. \n\nThe guilt the author feels might be societal pressure, thinking they should maintain family ties regardless of the past. But if the family is toxic, it's reasonable to prioritize their own well-being and their child's. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on past abuse and the current non-communication with their family. It's their right to protect themselves and their child from a harmful environment.\n"
