We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They have a complicated relationship with their family, who were controlling and abusive. They ran away at 20 due to that. Now, they're 37 weeks pregnant, and haven't told their family. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them, but they feel guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their past. If the family is abusive and controlling, keeping the pregnancy private might be a protective measure. The user is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm or manipulation. On the other hand, some might argue that family has a right to know. But given the history, the user's decision to not share could be about safety. \n\nThe user mentions fear of how the family would react\u2014judgment, harassment, maybe even trying to control the situation. Also, they're worried about their child being affected. So the decision isn't just about secrecy; it's about avoiding harm. In such cases, prioritizing one's safety and the child's well-being is crucial. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family members about a pregnancy unless there's a court order or custody issues, which isn't mentioned here. Ethically, it's more about the user's right to autonomy and their child's right to be protected from a toxic environment. \n\nThe user isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who has a legal claim; it's about their own family who was harmful. They\u2019re not avoiding responsibility but protecting against potential negative outcomes. \n\nIn similar situations, people often choose not to inform family if it's not in their best interest. So, the answer here is likely B (Not in the wrong). They\u2019re making a tough choice based on their experiences and need for safety.\n"
