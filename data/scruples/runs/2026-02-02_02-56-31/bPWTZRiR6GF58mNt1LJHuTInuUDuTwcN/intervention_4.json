We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The user is a woman who is 37 weeks pregnant but hasn't told her biological family. She has a history of a very controlling and abusive family environment. She ran away at 20 because of mental abuse, controlling behaviors, and a toxic family dynamic. They haven't communicated much since, only occasional texts that escalate into arguments. She's now in a stable relationship and happy but feels conflicted about not telling her family.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family hasn't been supportive. They were controlling and abusive, which led her to leave home. They don't have a healthy relationship; when they do talk, it's hostile. From her perspective, not telling them isn't about hiding the pregnancy but protecting herself and her child from potential harm. She's worried about their reaction, possible blame, and the negative impact on her child if they were to meet the family.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family is important and that she has a responsibility to inform them. However, considering the abusive background, keeping it secret might be a form of self-protection. The key here is the nature of the relationship. If the family hasn't been part of her life in a positive way, isn't supportive, and has a history of abuse, then not telling them could be a reasonable choice.\n\nAlso, she hasn't ignored them entirely, but they reach out to her, and those interactions are negative. The act of not disclosing might not be hiding if there's no meaningful contact. The fear of their reaction is valid, and she's considering her child's well-being too. The question is whether she's obligated to inform them despite the harmful environment.\n\nIn many cases, people are not obligated to maintain contact with family if it's harmful. The concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often looks at intentions and context. Her intention is to protect herself and her child from further trauma. So, in this situation, it's more about self-preservation rather than being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
