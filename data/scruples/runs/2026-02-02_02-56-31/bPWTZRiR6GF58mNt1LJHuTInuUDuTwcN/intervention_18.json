We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They have a history of a controlling, abusive family. The mother is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. The user ran away at 20 to escape that environment. Now, they're pregnant and haven't told their biological family, who they don't speak to except for rare, hostile texts.\n\nFirst, the user is considering if they're hiding the pregnancy. The family hasn't been in their life in a healthy way, so if they haven't told them, is it hiding? The user is scared of the family's reaction, potential judgment about being unmarried, and the possible impact on their child. They're worried the child might later resent them for not having the other side of the family involved, but they also fear the family's treatment of the child.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and control. The family isn't a supportive presence; they've been toxic. The user has built a life away from them. In such cases, maintaining distance is often necessary for the child's well-being too. The user isn't in the wrong for protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. The guilt they feel might stem from societal expectations, but in this context, their decision to not inform the family is about safety, not secrecy. The answer would likely be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
