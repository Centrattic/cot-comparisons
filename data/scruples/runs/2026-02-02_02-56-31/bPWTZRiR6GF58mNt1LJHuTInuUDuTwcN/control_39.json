We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 37 weeks pregnant and has been in a strained relationship with her family. She ran away at 20 due to a controlling, abusive environment. Her mother is described as a narcissist, and the family is very controlling and religious. They haven't been in contact except for occasional hostile texts. The author is now in a stable relationship and doesn't want to risk her child being exposed to the same environment.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse, the lack of healthy communication with the family, and the fear of how they might react to the pregnancy. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone she's in regular contact with; the family reaches out to her in a negative way. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, if the family hasn't been supportive or involved in her life, it's not necessarily her responsibility to inform them. Especially if there's a risk of harm to her or her child. The idea of \"hiding\" might not apply if they haven't been part of her life. Also, she's considering the well-being of her child, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to inform family, but that often assumes a healthy relationship. In this case, the relationship is toxic. The author's priority is her own safety and her child's, which is reasonable. So, she isn't in the wrong for choosing not to share the news with a family that's been abusive. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
