We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that the author left an abusive family a couple of years ago due to controlling and mentally abusive parents. The family hasn't been in contact except for occasional hostile texts. The author is now pregnant, in a happy relationship, and considering whether she has an obligation to inform her family.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author has a moral or ethical obligation to tell her family. The key factors here are the nature of the relationship. The family hasn't been in contact, and when they do reach out, it's hostile. The author left because of abuse, so maintaining contact isn't healthy. The question is about whether not telling them makes her wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, family obligations can vary. If the family is toxic and hasn't supported the author, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her well-being and her child's. The author might fear negative reactions, like criticism for being unmarried or the child being affected by the family's beliefs. The author also considers the child's future, worried about potential harm from the family. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform parents about a pregnancy unless there's a court order or custody issues, which isn't mentioned here. The question is more about social or familial expectations. However, given the history of abuse, it's understandable that the author wants to cut ties. The fact that the family hasn't reached out in a positive way and has been hostile means that the author isn't neglecting a close relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured her, so the decision is hers. The guilt she feels might stem from societal norms, but her actions are protecting herself and her child from potential harm. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because she's prioritizing her safety and the child's well-being in the context of a harmful family environment.\n"
