We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They have a history of a very controlling and abusive family, which is a big part of their reasoning for not telling them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user ran away from home due to mental abuse and controlling behavior. Their mom is described as a narcissist, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. The user hasn't spoken to them in a while except for occasional hostile texts. The family's reactions are negative, and the user is afraid of how they might react to the pregnancy, especially since they disapprove of being unmarried. They also fear how their future child would be treated by this family.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The key points here are the abusive environment, the lack of communication, and the potential harm to the child. The user has valid reasons for not wanting to contact their family. The family hasn't reached out in a supportive way, and their past behavior suggests they would be harmful. The user is prioritizing their own safety and their child's well-being, which are legitimate concerns.\n\nThe user might feel guilty because family is expected to be informed about such events, but in this case, the family isn't part of their life in a healthy way. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the user has good reasons rooted in protecting themselves and their child from harmful interactions. The decision is based on self-protection and the child's well-being, which are valid considerations.\n"
