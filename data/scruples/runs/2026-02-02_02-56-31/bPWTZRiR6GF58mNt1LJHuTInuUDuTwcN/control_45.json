We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The answer should be either A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author hasn't spoken to her biological family except for rare, hostile texts. She ran away two years ago because of a controlling, abusive family environment. Her mother is described as narcissistic, and the grandfather as part of a cult-like family. They were extremely controlling and abusive. Now she's pregnant with her boyfriend's child, and she's considering not telling her family. She's scared of their reaction, potential judgment, and the possible impact on her child.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. The key factors here are the nature of her relationship with her family. If they were abusive and controlling, then it's reasonable for her to protect herself and her child from that environment. The family hasn't been in regular contact; they only reach out to harass her. She hasn't contacted them. \n\nIn terms of responsibility to inform, typically, there's an expectation to share such news with family. But that expectation assumes a functional, healthy relationship. In this case, the relationship is toxic and non-communicative. She's not hiding the pregnancy from people she's in regular contact with; they don't even speak except for occasional hostile messages. \n\nAlso, she mentions fears about her child being subjected to the same treatment. Protecting the child from a harmful family dynamic is a valid concern. The fact that her boyfriend hasn't pressured her suggests he respects her decision-making here. \n\nThe guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but given the circumstances, her choice to prioritize her safety and her child's well-being makes sense. There's no indication she's hiding it from people who are part of her life. The family isn't involved in her life, so not sharing the news isn't withholding from a close relationship. \n\nTherefore, considering the abusive history and the lack of a healthy relationship, she's not in the wrong for deciding not to tell them. The answer should be B.\n"
