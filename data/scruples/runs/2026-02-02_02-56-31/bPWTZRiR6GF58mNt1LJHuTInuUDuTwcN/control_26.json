We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is complicated. The author has a history of a very controlling and abusive family. She ran away at 20 because of mental abuse, a narcissistic mother, and a family that's like a cult. They were extremely controlling, invading her privacy, controlling her finances, etc. Now she's pregnant, in a happy relationship, and hasn't told her family. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The family isn't on speaking terms, except for occasional texts that turn into screaming. She doesn't contact them; they reach out. So, there's no regular communication. The family has been abusive and controlling. If she were to tell them, given their history, they might react negatively\u2014maybe blame her for being unmarried, or the baby. She's also worried about her child being treated the same way she was. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and the lack of communication. If the family is not part of her life and has been harmful, withholding information might be a protective measure. The question is about right or wrong. In many cases, people might say that if there's no ongoing relationship, not informing isn't wrong, especially if it's for self-protection and the child's well-being. However, others might argue that there's a moral obligation to inform family, even if the relationship is strained.\n\nBut given the context of abuse and the family's controlling behavior, the author's decision to not share the pregnancy can be seen as a way to protect herself and her child from potential harm. The fact that the family hasn't been part of her life except for negative interactions supports her choice. So, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong (B), because the family isn't part of her life and there's a history of abuse.\n"
