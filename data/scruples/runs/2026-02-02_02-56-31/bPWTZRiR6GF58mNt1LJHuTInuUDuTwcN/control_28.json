We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They have a really bad history with their family\u2014abusive, controlling, narcissistic parents. They ran away when they were 20 because of that. Now they're pregnant with their boyfriend's child and the family is on bad terms. They haven't spoken to their family except for occasional texts where the family screams at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is described as extremely controlling and abusive. The author left because of mental abuse. The mother is a narcissist, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They have a strict religious background and push their values. The author is now in a stable situation with a partner and has a child. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not telling their family.\n\nThe author feels guilty but also afraid of the reaction. They're worried about how the family would treat the baby. The key points here are the family's behavior and the author's right to protect themselves and their child from potential harm. In such cases, where there's a history of abuse, it's often advised not to put oneself or the child in that situation again. The family hasn't reached out positively, only to harrass. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who's involved in their life, but from estranged, abusive relatives.\n\nSo, considering that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. The answer should be B.\n"
