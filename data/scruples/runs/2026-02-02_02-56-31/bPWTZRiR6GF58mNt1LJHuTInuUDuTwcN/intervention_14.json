We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They have a complicated history with their family, involving control and abuse. They ran away at 20 due to a controlling mother and a family with extreme religious views. Now, they're pregnant and haven't told their family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family isn't on speaking terms except for occasional hostile texts. The user hasn't initiated contact. The mother is described as narcissistic, and the family is controlling. The user left because of the abuse, found stability, and now has a supportive partner. They're scared of how the family might react\u2014judgment about being unmarried, potential harm to their child, and fear of the family's toxic influence.\n\nThe user feels guilty for not telling, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. Legally, there's no obligation to inform family members about a pregnancy unless there's a court order or custody situation, which isn't mentioned here. Emotionally and ethically, it's more nuanced. The user is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. They're prioritizing their child's well-being by not exposing them to a toxic environment. \n\nThe answer hinges on the user's right to autonomy and safety. They're not hiding the pregnancy from close family in a positive sense; they're avoiding contact with a family that's been abusive. The guilt they feel might stem from societal expectations, but their situation is unique. Deciding not to contact them isn't hiding if they don't have a relationship. The key points are the history of abuse, lack of communication, and the potential risks to the child. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
