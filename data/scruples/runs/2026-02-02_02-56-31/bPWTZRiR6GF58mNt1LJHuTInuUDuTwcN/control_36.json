We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that the author has a very toxic family. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the family is controlling and abusive. She ran away at 20 because of the abuse. Now she's pregnant, and hasn't told her family. She's not in contact with them except for occasional hostile messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the family's behavior. They controlled her life, invaded her privacy, and were mentally abusive. She left because of that. If she were to tell them, they might react negatively. The author is worried about their judgment, especially regarding being unmarried and pregnant. Also, she's concerned about how they might treat her child.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If we look at the typical reasons why someone might be \"in the wrong,\" it could be about hiding something important from family. But in this case, the family isn't really part of her life anymore. They haven't spoken in a long time, and the communication is hostile. She's not the one reaching out. The last contact was harassment. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to inform family about major life events, but that's usually when the relationship is healthy or at least functional. Here, the relationship is toxic and non-existent. The author is protecting herself from potential harm. The fact that she's in a stable relationship now and has a child is a new chapter. Her family's behavior makes it so that revealing the pregnancy could lead to abuse or harm to both her and the baby. \n\nAlso, the guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but given the context, her decision is a form of self-preservation. The family isn't maintaining a relationship; they're the ones who cut off contact and act abusively. So, not telling them isn't a betrayal but a necessary choice for her well-being.\n\nAnother angle: if she hasn't had contact, how can it be considered hiding? They don't engage in regular communication. The last time they reached out, it was hostile. She's not avoiding them in this scenario because they're the ones who aren't present. So, there's no obligation to inform them if they're not part of her life.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say that family has a right to know about a grandchild. But again, if the family is abusive, that right might not outweigh the harm. The author is prioritizing her child's safety and her own mental health. The fear that her child might be affected by this family's behavior is valid if they're as toxic as described.\n\nIn conclusion, given the abusive nature of the family, the lack of communication, and the potential for negative reactions, the author isn't in the wrong for not telling them. Her decision is a protective measure. So the answer is B.\n"
