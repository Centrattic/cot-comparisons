We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author hasn't told her family because they have a very toxic relationship. She ran away from home due to controlling and abusive parents. The family is described as controlling, religious, and abusive. The author is afraid of their reaction if she tells them about the pregnancy. Her boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them. The key points here are the family's behavior and the author's decision to protect herself and her child from potential harm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of AITA (Am I the Asshole). The question is whether not telling the family makes the author wrong. The family has been abusive and controlling, so from a self-defense and protecting her child's well-being standpoint, her decision might be justified. However, some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild, but given the family's history, that argument might not hold as strong.\n\nThe author mentions that the family hasn't reached out in a meaningful way beyond occasional texts that turn into yelling. She hasn't contacted them first. The decision to withhold information is based on fear of harassment and potential harm to her child. In such cases, protecting one's mental health and the child's future is a valid reason. \n\nThe question is whether not informing the family is wrong. Since the family has been abusive and the author is protecting herself and her child from further harm, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). However, I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe there's a cultural expectation or family obligations, but given the context of abuse, those factors are less relevant. The author's safety and the child's well-being are prioritized, which is the key point here.\n"
