We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The situation is complicated. The author left home because her family was controlling and abusive. Her mom's a narcissist, and the family is controlling and religious. They haven't spoken much except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. She's pregnant and hasn't told them. The boyfriend hasn't pushed her, but she feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family's behavior. The author's family sounds toxic and abusive. She ran away at 20 for a reason. If she told them, they might react negatively, maybe blame her for being unmarried, which is a common issue in some conservative families. Also, she's worried about her child being exposed to that environment. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. From a moral standpoint, is there an obligation to inform family about a pregnancy? Well, if the relationship is already strained and there's no contact, does that obligation still exist? The author hasn't reached out, they just text occasionally. If they haven't been in contact, maybe it's not hiding but rather choosing not to share due to valid reasons. \n\nAlso, the author is prioritizing her and her child's well-being. She fears the family's reaction and their potential harmful influence on her child. That's a valid concern. The guilt she feels might come from societal expectations, but her situation is unique. The answer might depend on the context of the relationship. If the family isn't part of her life, then she's not necessarily hiding it; it's more about choosing not to engage with harmful people. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (not in the wrong). She's protecting herself and her child from a harmful environment. There's no obligation to reconnect with an abusive family unless she wants to, and she's not obligated to share personal news with people who aren't supportive.\n"
