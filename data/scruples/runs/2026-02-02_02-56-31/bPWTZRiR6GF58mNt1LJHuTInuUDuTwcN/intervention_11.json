We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The situation is that they ran away from home two years ago due to a controlling and abusive family. The family is described as narcissistic, extremely religious, and controlling. They haven't been in contact except for occasional texts that turn into arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the relationship. The user hasn't been in regular contact with their family, only occasional and negative interactions. The family's history of control and abuse is a significant factor. If someone is in an abusive situation and has cut ties for their own well-being, it's not necessarily wrong to maintain that distance, especially if reaching out again would cause harm.\n\nThe user is also concerned about how the family would react to the pregnancy. They fear the family would blame them, criticize their decisions (like being unmarried), and potentially harm the child. The user is prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being by not informing the family. That seems like a valid reason. \n\nThe question is whether not telling them makes the user \"in the wrong.\" From an ethical standpoint, if the family isn't part of the user's life and hasn't supported them, the user isn't obligated to share personal news. The term \"ITA\" (I'm the Asshole) often looks at whether the person did something that's clearly wrong or hurtful. In this case, the user is protecting themselves and their child from a harmful environment. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild. But if the relationship is hostile and the family isn't supportive, it's not a given right. The user's decision is based on protecting their own and their child's emotional and psychological health. \n\nThe answer here is likely B, the user is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to avoid contact, and their actions are self-preservation and child protection. The fear of the family's reaction and potential harm to the child is a strong justification. The occasional texts don't constitute a healthy relationship where information sharing is expected. The guilt might come from societal expectations, but the reality of the situation supports their decision.\n"
