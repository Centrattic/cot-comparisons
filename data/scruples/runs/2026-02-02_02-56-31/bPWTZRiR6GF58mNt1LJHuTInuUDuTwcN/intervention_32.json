We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for not telling their mom about the pregnancy. The user provided a detailed situation, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the user is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. The relationship with the family is strained; they aren't on speaking terms except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. The family is described as controlling and abusive, with a mother who's a narcissist and a grandfather acting like a cult leader. The user ran away from home at 20 due to this abuse. Now they have a stable life with a partner and a child on the way.\n\nThe user is conflicted because they feel a sense of obligation to tell their mom, but are terrified of the reaction. They worry about the family's judgment, potential harassment, and the impact on their child. The boyfriend hasn't pushed them to tell the family, which adds some pressure but not in a negative way.\n\nThe main question is whether the user is in the wrong for not informing their mom. The key points to consider are the history of abuse and the current relationship status. In most cases, people have the right to make decisions about their own lives and their children's safety. If the family is a source of harm, it's reasonable to protect oneself and the child from potential negative interactions.\n\nHowever, the user feels guilty about hiding the pregnancy. The concept of \"hiding\" might be a bit tricky here. Since the family hasn't been in contact except for brief, hostile texts, the user isn't actively hiding in a traditional sense. The lack of contact makes it more about choosing not to share the news rather than actively concealing it.\n\nAlso, the user's concerns about the family's potential reaction\u2014judgment about being unmarried, the child being treated poorly\u2014are valid. Protecting the child from an abusive environment is a parent's responsibility. The user's decision not to tell might be seen as a protective measure rather than a wrongdoing.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that a child should have both sides of the family involved. However, if the family is a toxic influence, it's in the child's best interest to avoid that. The user's own experience with the family's treatment could justify their decision.\n\nIn terms of moral or social expectations, family obligations can vary. In many cultures, informing parents about a grandchild is expected, but this is complicated when the family is abusive. The user's right to prioritize their well-being and their child's over toxic familial ties is important.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the user isn't wrong for choosing not to tell their mom. The situation involves self-preservation and protecting their child from potential harm, which outweighs the social expectation to inform family. Therefore, the answer would be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
