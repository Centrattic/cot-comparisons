We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The context is that they have a very toxic family situation with a narcissistic mother and controlling family. They ran away at 20 due to abuse and have been separated from their family for years. The family only contacts them to scream about not being in touch. The person is now pregnant, in a stable relationship, and considering whether to tell their family.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key points here are the family's behavior and the potential consequences of informing them. The family is described as abusive, controlling, religious, and likely to react negatively. The author is scared of their reaction and the possible harm to their child. They feel guilty but don't see a valid reason to inform them since they haven't been in contact. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't obligated to inform their family. The family's actions were the root cause of the separation. The author prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being is understandable. The question is whether keeping this information from estranged family who have shown no positive support is wrong. \n\nSociety might view not informing family as a negative, but in this context, the family isn't a supportive network. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy in a relationship with their boyfriend, and the family hasn't demonstrated any concern for their life. The guilt comes from internal conflict, not external pressure. The author is making a choice to protect themselves and their child from potential harm. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not telling. The answer is B.\n"
