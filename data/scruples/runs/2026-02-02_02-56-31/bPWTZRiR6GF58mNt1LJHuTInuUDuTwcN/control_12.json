We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The situation is complicated. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's family history is really intense. They describe their mom as a narcissistic parent and the grandfather running the family like a cult. They had to run away at 20 because of controlling, abusive behavior. The family is extremely religious and controlling, invading privacy, controlling finances, and such. The author left, found stability, a job, a partner, and now is pregnant. They haven't told their family, and the question is whether they're in the wrong for not doing so.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant, which means the baby will be born soon. They worry about how the family would react\u2014probably with anger, judgment, and maybe even more harassment. The author is scared that the family would pass on the same treatment to their baby. They also feel guilty about hiding the pregnancy, but they argue that if they haven't been in contact, it's not hiding. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell, which adds to the complexity.\n\nFrom what I know, in situations where there's a history of abuse or manipulation, it's not typically the victim's fault for not reaching out. The family isn't maintaining contact; they only reach out to criticize. The author is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. The guilt they feel might come from societal expectations that family should be involved, but the author's safety and the child's well-being are more important. \n\nI think the key points here are the history of abuse and the current lack of communication. Choosing not to inform abusers about a significant life event to protect oneself and the child isn't wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their mental health and their baby's safety. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
