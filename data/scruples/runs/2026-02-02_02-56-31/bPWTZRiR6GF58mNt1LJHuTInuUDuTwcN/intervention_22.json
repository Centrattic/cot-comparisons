We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 37 weeks pregnant but hasn't told her family. They haven't been on speaking terms except for rare texts that turn into arguments. She left home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family environment. The mother is described as narcissistic, the grandfather runs a cult-like family with extreme religious views. They controlled her life, invaded her privacy, etc. She's now in a stable relationship and feels guilty about not telling her family, but scared of their reaction. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her. She's worried about the baby not meeting them and potential future issues. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nFirst, considering the context of abuse and control. If the family was abusive, cutting off contact is a common and healthy response. She's protecting herself and the baby from possible harm or manipulation. The guilt might come from societal expectations that family should be included, but in abusive situations, that doesn't apply. The fact that they haven't spoken in months and their previous interactions are hostile makes it clear communication isn't healthy. The fear of them reacting negatively, especially with the baby, is valid. The person is prioritizing safety and well-being, which is right. The answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because she's protecting herself from an abusive family. However, some might argue that there's a duty to family, but given the circumstances, her actions are justified.\n"
