We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation involves a family that's been controlling and abusive. The author left home at 20 due to mental abuse and a controlling environment. Now she's pregnant and hasn't told her family, who she's not close with. They occasionally contact her but in a hostile way.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and the current lack of communication. The author's reasons for not telling her family are valid because she's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The family's behavior\u2014being controlling, invading privacy, and hostile\u2014makes it a low-trust situation. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the responsibility lies with the family to maintain a healthy relationship. Since they've been abusive and there's no current communication, the author isn't obligated to reach out. The fear of their reaction and potential harm to her child are justified. The fact that they haven't been in touch for months and their past behavior means there's no expectation for her to update them. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and her child's safety. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
