We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about their pregnancy. They have a complicated relationship with their family, especially their mom, who they describe as narcissistic. The family is controlling and religious. The user ran away two years ago because of the abuse. Now they're pregnant and haven't told their family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user hasn't had contact with their family except for occasional hostile texts. The family's behavior is described as abusive and controlling. The user is in a stable situation now, with a supportive boyfriend. They're afraid of how the family would react to the pregnancy\u2014likely negative, given their history. The user is also worried about their child being exposed to that toxic environment.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong for not telling their mom. On one hand, family relationships can be important, and there's a cultural expectation sometimes to inform family members about such news. But on the other hand, the user is protecting themselves and their unborn child from potential harm. The mother's behavior is abusive, so not contacting them might be a form of self-preservation.\n\nThe user is feeling guilt, which is common in such situations. They might feel they should try to reconnect or at least inform the family, but their safety and well-being are crucial. The decision to not tell the family could be seen as a responsible choice given the circumstances. The answer would likely hinge on the balance between familial obligations and personal safety. Since the user has valid reasons to avoid contact due to abuse, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). They\u2019re protecting themselves and their child, which is prioritizing well-being over strained family ties.\n"
