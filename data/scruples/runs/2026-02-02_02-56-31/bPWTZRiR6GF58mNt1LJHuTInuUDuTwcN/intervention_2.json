We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They have a history of a really controlling and abusive family. The mom is a narcissist, the grandfather runs a cult-like family, they were super religious and controlling. The user ran away at 20 because of that. Now they're 37 weeks pregnant, have a stable life with a boyfriend, but haven't told their family. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them, but they feel guilty. They're scared of how the family would react, the baby might be treated, and they don't want the child to go through the same abuse.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong for not informing their family. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user wants to know if they're in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethical aspects here. From an ethical standpoint, there's the question of family obligations versus personal safety and well-being. The user has a history of abuse and control from their family. They left that environment for a good reason. Now, they're in a healthy relationship and have a child. The decision to not tell their family isn't about hiding information if there's no contact. They mention that communication is minimal and hostile. They haven't initiated contact; the family does, but it's negative.\n\nOn one hand, some might say that family should be informed of a new child, especially if there's a possibility of a relationship. But the user has valid reasons to fear for their safety and their child's safety. The family's potential reaction could be harmful, and they don't want their child to be subjected to that. Also, if the family isn't part of the child's life, does that make the user wrong? It's a balance between family ties and protecting oneself and the child from harm.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family about a pregnancy, especially if there's no court order or custody issues. The user is not in contact with their family, so withholding information isn't against the law. Ethically, it's more about what's right for them given their history. They have a right to protect themselves and their child from abusive family members.\n\nThe guilt they feel is understandable, but in this context, their actions seem justified. They're prioritizing their well-being and their child's. The family's response could be toxic, and the user has already established distance for a good reason. The key points are the history of abuse, lack of positive contact, and the potential harm to the child. So, the answer is likely B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
