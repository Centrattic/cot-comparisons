We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author has a complicated relationship with her family, describing them as controlling and abusive. She ran away at 20 because of the mental abuse and the family's controlling behavior. Now she's pregnant with her boyfriend's child and hasn't told her family. She's worried about their reaction, potential judgment, and the impact on her child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The author mentions that they aren't on speaking terms except for occasional texts that turn into yelling. She doesn't initiate contact; they do. So, in practical terms, there's already minimal communication. If she hasn't been in regular contact, is her silence considered hiding? Maybe she's not hiding it if they don't have a consistent relationship.\n\nThe family's controlling nature adds another layer. They're religious, pushy, and have a history of invading privacy. The author fears their reaction, thinking they'll call her names and be upset she's unmarried. Also, she's concerned about her child being exposed to the same treatment she received. The well-being of the child is a big factor here. If the family is abusive, keeping them away might be in the child's best interest.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, people have the right to make decisions about their lives, especially regarding family they've already distanced themselves from. If the family is toxic, avoiding contact to protect herself and her child isn't wrong. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from active contact; the family hasn't reached out meaningfully. So, is it her responsibility to update them, or does her safety and her child's well-being take precedence?\n\nAlso, the definition of \"hiding\" could be debated here. Hiding implies an intentional effort to conceal from someone you have a relationship with. Since the author hasn't spoken to them in a while and the communication is strained, it's not the same as hiding from someone you're close to. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations rather than actual wrongdoing.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the history of abuse, the lack of meaningful communication, and the protection of the child, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to tell her family. Her decision is influenced by valid concerns about their potential harmful reactions. So the answer would be B.\n"
