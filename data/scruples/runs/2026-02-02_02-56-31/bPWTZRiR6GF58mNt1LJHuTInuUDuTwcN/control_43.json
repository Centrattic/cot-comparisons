We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. She had a bad experience with her family, running away at 20 because they were controlling and abusive. The mom is a narcissist, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling, invading her privacy, controlling her finances. Now she's with her boyfriend who's supportive, but she's torn about telling her family. She's scared of their reaction, especially since they might react with anger, criticize her for being unmarried, and possibly harm her child. She's worried about her daughter growing up without knowing the other side of the family but fears the family's treatment.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the key factors here are the history of abuse and control. The family isn't in her life except for occasional hostile texts. She didn't reach out; they do. If you have a family that's abusive and you cut ties for your safety, it's not your fault. The fact that she left because of the abuse is important. The family's behavior is toxic, so keeping the pregnancy private makes sense. The author isn't in the wrong because she's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The family would likely react negatively, given their controlling nature. Also, they haven't maintained a healthy relationship, so her decision is self-preservation. The feeling of guilt is natural, but given the circumstances, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
