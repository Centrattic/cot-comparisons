We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. The family isn't in regular contact, only sporadic texts that turn into arguments. The user left home two years ago due to a controlling, abusive environment with a narcissistic mother and a religious, cult-like family. They have a stable life now with a supportive boyfriend.\n\nThe main question is whether they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about the pregnancy. The user feels guilty but is terrified of the family's reaction. They're worried about the family's potential abuse towards their child and whether the child might hate them later for not connecting with the other side.\n\nFirst, consider the user's reasoning. They left an abusive situation, so maintaining distance is a form of self-preservation. If the family is toxic, hiding the pregnancy could be a protective measure for both the user and the child. The user hasn't contact initiated, so maybe the family isn't really part of their life anymore. The user is also considering the child's well-being, fearing the family's treatment. That shows responsibility and care.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that cutting off completely could be seen as abandoning family. But in cases of abuse, staying in contact can be harmful. The user's health and the child's safety are priorities. The fact that the family hasn't been supportive or respectful in the past makes it less likely they would react positively. The user's boyfriend hasn't pressured them, which suggests he respects their decision.\n\nEthically, the user isn't obligated to reconnect with a family that was abusive. They have the right to protect themselves and their child. Guilt is natural, but it doesn't mean they're wrong. The key factors are the history of abuse, the lack of a healthy relationship, and the potential harm from contact. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
