  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not telling my mom that I'm pregnant?\nI'm about 37 weeks pregnant but I still haven't told any of my biological family. We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is a pregnant woman who hasn't told her biological family about her pregnancy. They've had a history of being controlling and abusive. She left home two years ago because of the toxic environment. Now she's scared to tell them because she's worried about their reaction and the potential harm to her child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, there's the idea of family being important and the right to know about a grandchild. On the other hand, the user's well-being and safety, as well as her child's, are significant factors. The family in question has a history of abuse and control, which could lead to harmful behavior if they find out. The user is also concerned about her child being exposed to that environment.\n\nMoral responsibility is tricky here. If the family is abusive, is it wrong to protect oneself and the child by not involving them? The user hasn't been in contact, so maybe the obligation to inform is lessened. But some might argue that blood relatives have a right to know. However, given the context of abuse, prioritizing safety makes sense. The user's decision is also influenced by genuine fear, not just avoidance. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If we consider the potential for harm from her family, it's understandable she wouldn't want to involve them. The responsibility to protect her child from a harmful environment is a strong point. But some might say that cutting off completely and not informing could lead to future issues, like the child wanting to know their family. However, the user's reasoning is to prevent that same toxic cycle.\n\nBalancing these factors, the answer likely leans towards not being in the wrong because the user is protecting herself and the child from known harm. The family's prior actions justify her decision to not disclose. So, answer B.\n"
