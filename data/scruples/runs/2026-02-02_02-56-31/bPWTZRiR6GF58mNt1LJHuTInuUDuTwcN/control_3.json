We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. They left home two years ago due to a controlling and abusive family environment. The mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the family is extremely controlling and religious. The author is now in a stable situation with their boyfriend, who hasn't pressured them to tell the family. The author feels guilt about hiding the pregnancy but questions if it's really hiding since contact is minimal. They're scared of how the family will react\u2014accusing them of lying, disapproving of being unmarried, and worrying about the child being affected by the family's toxic behavior.\n\nSo, the main points here are the family's past behavior and the author's current emotional state. The author is prioritizing their safety and well-being, as well as their child's, by not involving an abusive family. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this decision.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it's a personal decision. The family isn't part of the author's life anymore, so the author isn't under an obligation to inform them. The term \"hiding\" might not apply if there's no regular contact. The family's potential negative reaction and the risk of the child being exposed to that environment are valid concerns. The author is protecting themselves and their child from harm, which is a justifiable reason.\n\nLegally, there's no requirement to inform family. Emotionally, the author is dealing with fear and guilt, but their actions are a form of self-preservation. The key is that the family isn't supportive or safe, so the author isn't acting wrong by withholding information to protect their new family.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
