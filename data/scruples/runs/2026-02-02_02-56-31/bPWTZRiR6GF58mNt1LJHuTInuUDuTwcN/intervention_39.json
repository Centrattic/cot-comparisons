We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a woman who is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They haven't been on speaking terms for a while, with communication being minimal and negative. She left home due to a controlling, abusive family environment. Her mother is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely controlling and religious.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them about her pregnancy. She feels guilty but is scared of their reaction. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them. She's worried about potential backlash and the impact on her child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of her relationship with her family. If they were abusive and controlling, maintaining contact could be harmful. The fact that they haven't spoken for a long time and their interactions are hostile suggests that cutting off contact might be a protective measure. In such cases, not sharing life updates like a pregnancy could be seen as self-preservation rather than secrecy.\n\nHowever, the user is feeling conflicted because there's a sense of guilt. She's concerned about the future implications for her child and whether her child will miss out. But it's important to balance the child's potential interest in having relatives with the risk of exposing the child to a harmful environment.\n\nIn many cases, when there's a history of abuse or toxic family dynamics, it's not only acceptable but advisable to limit contact. The user's decision to not inform her family might stem from protecting herself and her child from possible harm. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If the family's behavior was genuinely abusive, then her choice to not tell them isn't wrong. She's prioritizing her well-being and her child's safety.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild. But if the family is not supportive and poses a risk, then withholding information is a reasonable choice. The key here is the nature of the relationship. If the family is estranged and harmful, the answer would lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
