We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author's family situation: she ran away two years ago due to a controlling, abusive environment. The family is described as narcissistic, religious, and controlling, with a cult-like dynamic. Communication is minimal and hostile. She's now in a stable relationship and pregnant. She's considering whether to tell her family, fearing their reaction and the potential impact on her child.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. From the details, it seems like her decision stems from a place of self-preservation and protecting her child. She's not hiding the pregnancy from a family member who is actively involved in her life but rather from estranged family who have been abusive. The guilt she feels is likely because she's human and might feel societal pressure, but her reasons are rooted in safety and well-being.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform estranged family. Morally, it's a personal choice where her mental health and her child's future are considered. The fact that the family hasn't reached out in a meaningful way and have a history of abuse makes her decision more understandable. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because her actions are self-protective and the family isn't in a position where her silence harms them. The key factors are the family's behavior and the lack of positive relationship.\n"
