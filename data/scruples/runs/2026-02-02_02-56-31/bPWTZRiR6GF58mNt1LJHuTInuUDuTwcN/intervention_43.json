We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is about to give birth and hasn't told any of their biological family. Their family isn't on speaking terms, except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. They ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family environment. The mother is described as narcissistic, and the grandfather as part of a cult-like family with extreme religious views. The family controlled every aspect of their life, including checking car mileage, monitoring bank accounts, and invading privacy. The user is now living independently, in a stable relationship, and is pregnant with their boyfriend's child. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell the family, but the user feels conflicted. They're worried about the family's reaction, potential harassment, and the impact on their baby. They're scared the family would treat the child the same way they were treated. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not telling their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspect. The user has a right to privacy and safety. If their family is abusive, they have a legitimate reason to protect themselves and their child. The family's controlling behavior raises red flags about how they might react to the pregnancy. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy in the traditional sense because they don't have contact. The concept of \"hiding\" might not apply here if there's no communication. The user's fear is valid, especially considering the potential harm to their child. The dilemma is between the moral obligation to inform family versus self-preservation.\n\nLegally, there's no requirement to inform family members about a pregnancy unless there are specific circumstances like custody issues, which isn't mentioned here. Ethically, some might argue that family has a right to know, but others would prioritize the well-being of the user and child. The key factors are the history of abuse, lack of communication, and the potential negative impact on the child.\n\nIf the user were to tell their mom, the mother might react negatively, as described\u2014accusing them of hiding it, judging them for being unmarried, and possibly trying to control the situation. The user's fear of the child being subjected to the same treatment is also a strong point. The user is making a choice to protect their family unit from a harmful external influence.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's unfair to cut off family entirely, but given the context of abuse, the user's decision could be seen as necessary. The fact that the user hasn't contacted their family but they occasionally reach out in a hostile way suggests that the user isn't the one initiating contact, which might mitigate the guilt they feel.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong), because the user is prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being over a strained and potentially harmful family relationship. The key is the justification for keeping it secret is based on valid concerns about abuse and control, not just personal preference.\n"
