We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The situation is complex. They left home due to a controlling, abusive family environment. The mother is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. The user is now in a stable relationship and is pregnant. They haven't told their family because they're scared of the reaction and potential harm to their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family dynamics. The user ran away because of abuse, so their decision not to contact the family isn't just about avoidance but a response to trauma. Withholding information about the pregnancy might be self-preservation. The user is also concerned about their child's safety and well-being if the family is involved. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them, which shows support.\n\nNow, the moral aspect. Is the user in the wrong? Well, in terms of family bonds, there's an expectation to share such news. But given the history of abuse, it's a protective measure. The user isn't hiding it in the sense of secrecy if there's no contact. The guilt comes from the family's perspective, but the user's priority is their child's safety and their own mental health.\n\nThe key points are the history of abuse, the potential for the family to react negatively, and the child's future. The decision isn't to hide but to protect. So, the answer would likely be B, they're not in the wrong. The user has valid reasons rooted in safety and past trauma. The guilt is misplaced if it's causing harm to them or the child.\n"
