I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant but hasn't told her biological family. They aren't on speaking terms except for the occasional text that turns into an argument. Two years ago, she ran away from home at 20 because her family was controlling and abusive. Her mom is a narcissist, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling, invading her privacy, checking her car mileage, controlling her bank account, etc. She left, got a job, a home, a boyfriend she's happy with, and now she's pregnant. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell her family. She's conflicted because she feels guilty but is scared of their reaction. She's worried they'll call her names for being unmarried and that her baby might not get to meet them or might be treated poorly. She's considering never telling them and wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the family dynamic. The family is described as abusive and controlling. The author left to escape that environment, so continuing to have contact might be harmful. The question is whether not informing them about the pregnancy is wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's protecting herself and her child from potential abuse or toxic influence. Family is supposed to support, but in this case, the family is harmful. The mother and grandfather's behavior was abusive, so keeping the pregnancy a secret could be a form of self-preservation. The author also mentions the fear of her child being exposed to the same treatment she had. That's a valid concern for a parent.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild, but in this case, the family isn't in a healthy relationship with the author. They haven't been in contact except for hostile messages. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone she's in regular contact with; the family hasn't been part of her life for a long time. So, the act of not telling them isn't hiding from active communication but avoiding contact with toxic people.\n\nThe key here is the nature of the family relationship. If the family is abusive and the author has cut off contact, not informing them isn't in the wrong. The author is prioritizing her and her child's safety and well-being. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations about family, but in this context, those expectations don't apply because the family isn't a supportive one.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The responsibility isn't on her to maintain contact with an abusive family. The situation is more about self-preservation than withholding information unjustly.\n"
