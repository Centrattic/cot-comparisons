We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about the pregnancy. So the user provided a detailed situation where the person is 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her biological family, and there's a history of a controlling, abusive family environment. The mother is described as narcissistic, the grandfather runs the family like a cult, and they were very controlling. The person ran away at 20, found their own life, and now is in a stable relationship with a child on the way.\n\nThe main question is whether not informing the family is the wrong choice. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (option A) or not (option B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family relationship. The user hasn't been in contact with her family except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. The family was abusive and controlling, leading her to leave home. The decision not to tell them could be seen as protecting herself and her child from potential harm or further conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not telling family about a pregnancy is a form of secrecy, which could be seen as wrong if there's a duty to inform relatives. However, the key here is the nature of the relationship. If the relationship is toxic and the family is abusive, then not engaging with them might be a necessary protective measure. The author might not feel a moral obligation to inform people who have been harmful in the past. \n\nAdditionally, the user mentions fear of the family's reaction, potential judgment about being unmarried, and concerns for the child's well-being. These are valid reasons to prioritize her own mental health and the child's safety. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, indicating that her decision is primarily about her comfort and safety. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's often an assumption that family should be informed about such life events. But those expectations don't account for toxic family dynamics. The author's situation is a case where those norms might not apply because the family isn't supportive. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on self-preservation and protecting her child from a harmful environment. The guilt she feels might stem from societal pressures, but the reality of her family's behavior justifies her choice. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
