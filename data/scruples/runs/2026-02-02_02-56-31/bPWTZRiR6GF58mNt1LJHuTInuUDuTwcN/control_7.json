We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author has a very negative relationship with her family, which sounds abusive and controlling. She left home at 20 because of the environment. Now she's pregnant and hasn't told her family because she's scared of their reaction. They haven't been in touch much except for occasional texts that turn into arguments.\n\nThe key points here are the dynamic between the author and her family. The family is described as controlling, mentally abusive, and religious, with a mom who's a narcissist and a grandfather running a cult-like family. The author is worried they'll react negatively to her being unmarried and pregnant. She also fears her child might suffer the same treatment she did.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. From a moral standpoint, if the family isn't supportive and has a history of abuse, it's reasonable for her to protect herself and her child. In many cases, not informing estranged, harmful family members can be a protective measure. The author isn't in contact with them, so withholding information isn't necessarily hiding it. The burden of maintaining contact is on the side that wants to communicate. Since they haven't spoken in months and their interactions are hostile, she's not obligated to share. Also, considering the well-being of her child, she might be making a responsible decision to avoid a toxic environment.\n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which adds to the idea that this is her personal decision. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but her safety and her child's safety are paramount. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
