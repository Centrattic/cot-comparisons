We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a woman who is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family, who she's not close with. They haven't been in touch except for occasional texts where the family members get angry. She ran away from home at 20 because of a controlling and abusive family environment. The mother is described as narcissistic, the grandfather runs the family like a cult, and they are extremely religious and controlling. Now she's in a stable relationship and has a child, but she's torn about whether she's in the wrong for not telling her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family wasn't supportive before; she left because of abuse. They don't communicate regularly, and the few times they do, it's hostile. The user's priority is protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the concept of \"wrong\" here is subjective. If the family isn't part of her life and she's in a healthy environment now, withholding information might not be wrong, especially if sharing it could risk her well-being or her child's. The fact that they might accuse her of hiding it doesn't make her wrong if she's protecting herself from their negativity. Also, considering the potential harm to the child from an abusive family's influence is a valid concern. The user's fear of her child being treated poorly is a strong reason to keep the information private.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family ties matter, and not informing them could be seen as cutting them off completely. But given the history, the user isn't cutting off; she's maintaining distance for her and her child's safety. The key points are the lack of a healthy relationship and the potential risks involved. Since she's not in a position where they have a normal, supportive relationship, her decision to stay silent isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
