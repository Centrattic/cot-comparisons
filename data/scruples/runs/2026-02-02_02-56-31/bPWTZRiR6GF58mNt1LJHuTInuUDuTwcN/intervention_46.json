We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They left their family two years ago because of controlling and abusive behavior. The family is described as very controlling, religious, and their mom is a narcissist. The person is now pregnant, in a stable relationship, and hasn't told their family. They\u2019re scared of how the family will react, including potential harassment and the child being affected. They\u2019re also worried about their child hating them later. The boyfriend hasn\u2019t pressured them to tell.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship with their family. If the family was abusive and controlling, the person has valid reasons to avoid contact. The family\u2019s behavior was harmful, so cutting off contact is a form of self-preservation. The question is whether not telling them about the pregnancy is wrong. \n\nFrom the person's perspective, they haven't had meaningful contact; the family only reaches out to scream. So, even if they didn't tell them, the family might not be supportive. The person is also worried about their child's safety and well-being if the family is involved. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the person has a right to protect themselves and their child from a harmful environment. The mother, as a narcissist, might react with blame and criticism rather than support. The person isn't hiding the pregnancy because they have a relationship; they're avoiding contact due to past trauma. \n\nThe guilt might come from societal expectations of family bonds, but the family's actions don't reflect healthy relationships. The person is making a choice to prioritize their safety and their child's well-being. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). They\u2019re acting in their best interest and their child's, given the family's history. The key points are the controlling behavior, fear of harassment, and protecting the child from a toxic environment. There's no obligation to maintain harmful relationships. Therefore, the person isn't in the wrong for not informing their family in this context.\n"
