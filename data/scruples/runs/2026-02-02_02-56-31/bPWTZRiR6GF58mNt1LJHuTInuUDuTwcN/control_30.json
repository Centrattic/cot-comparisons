We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is asking if they're at fault for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They have a complicated relationship with their family, which is described as controlling and abusive. They left home at 20 to escape that environment. Now, they're pregnant, and they're considering not telling their family because of past experiences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family isn't on speaking terms except for rare, hostile texts. The author doesn't reach out, only the family does. The family is described as narcissistic, controlling, and religious, with a cult-like structure. The author is afraid of how they'd react to the pregnancy, especially since they might disapprove of the marriage (since the author is with someone who makes them happy but the family might not accept them). The author is also worried about their child being exposed to the same treatment they got.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From what I read, the author has a valid reason to be scared. The relationship is toxic, and the family's behavior is abusive. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone they regularly communicate with; they have almost no contact. The guilt might come from feeling like a secret-keeper, but given the circumstances, it's more about self-protection and the child's well-being.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, people are judged based on their actions and intentions. Here, the author's reasons are about safety and avoiding harm. The family isn't part of their life, so not sharing the news might not be considered \"hiding\" since there's no regular communication. The author is prioritizing their mental health and their child's future. Therefore, it's more likely that the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
