  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not telling my mom that I'm pregnant?\nI'm about 37 weeks pregnant but I still haven't told any of my biological family. We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a woman who is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. She left home two years ago because of a controlling, abusive environment. The family is described as extremely controlling, religious, and mentally abusive. She's now in a stable relationship and feels guilty about not telling them about her pregnancy. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the relationship with her family. They haven't been in contact except for occasional hostile messages. The user left due to abuse, so the relationship isn't healthy. In such cases, the moral obligation to disclose might be different. People often have the right to protect themselves from harmful relationships.\n\nNext, the user's reasons for not telling them are mainly fear of their reaction. She's worried about their judgment, potential harassment, and the well-being of her child. These are valid concerns, especially if the family has a history of abuse. The child's welfare is a key point here. The user is trying to protect her child from a potentially toxic environment.\n\nThe question is about moral culpability. Is she wrong for choosing not to inform her family? If the family isn't part of her life and hasn't supported her, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her safety and her child's. Additionally, the definition of \"hiding\" might not apply here since they aren't in regular contact. She's not actively concealing it from people who are part of her current life.\n\nHowever, some might argue that even if the relationship is strained, there's a biological connection, and the family has a right to know. But considering the history of abuse and the current lack of communication, her decision can be seen as self-preservation. The well-being of the child is also a factor\u2014exposing the child to a harmful environment could be detrimental.\n\nIn similar situations, people often choose to cut off contact for their mental health and their children's. The guilt she feels is common, but it's important to validate her reasons. The key is whether her actions are in her best interest and her child's. Given the context, the answer is likely B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
