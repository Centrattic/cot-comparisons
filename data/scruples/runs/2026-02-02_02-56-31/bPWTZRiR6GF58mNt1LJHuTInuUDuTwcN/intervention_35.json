We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed. The user is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. They mention that the family isn't on speaking terms except for rare texts that turn into screaming. The family is described as controlling, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. They were abusive, controlling their life, invading privacy, etc. The user left home at 20, found stability, a good relationship, and now is pregnant.\n\nThe main question is whether not telling the family is wrong. The user is conflicted because they feel guilty but are terrified of the reaction. They're worried about the family's response, the baby's future, and potential treatment from the family. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the relationship with the family. If the family was abusive and controlling, not contacting them isn't inherently wrong. The user is protecting themselves from harm. The last contact was hostile, so not sharing such a vulnerable moment with them makes sense. The fear of the family's reaction is valid given their history. Also, the user is prioritizing their well-being and their child's future, which is important.\n\nBut there's a societal expectation to inform family about a pregnancy, especially a parent. However, if the family isn't part of the user's life and has been harmful, the user isn't obligated to share. The user isn't hiding it from an active relationship but from a family they've disengaged from. The guilt might come from internalized pressure, but the safety and mental health are key factors.\n\nSo, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether there's an obligation. If the family isn't part of their life, there's no duty to inform them. The user is prioritizing their safety, which is a valid choice. Therefore, the answer would be B, No, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
