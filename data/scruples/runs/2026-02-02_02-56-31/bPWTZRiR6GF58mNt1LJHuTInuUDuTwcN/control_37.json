We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty complicated. The author ran away from home at 20 because of a very controlling, abusive family. The mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the family is religious, controlling, and invasive. They haven't been in contact except for occasional texts that turn into arguments.\n\nThe author is now pregnant, in a stable relationship, and hasn't told her biological family. She's conflicted because she feels guilty but also terrified of their reaction. She's worried about how they might treat her child and whether they'd subject the child to the same treatment she experienced.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling her family. The key points here are the family's history of abuse and control. If she hasn't been in contact, and any contact is negative, it's not her fault for not sharing the news. The family's behavior is toxic, so withholding information to protect herself and her child seems reasonable. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but her safety and the child's well-being are more important. The answer should consider her right to protect herself from harmful influences, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
