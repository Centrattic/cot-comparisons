We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They had a really toxic family situation, left because of control and abuse. The family hasn't been in touch much except for rare texts that turn into yelling. The user is scared of the reaction if they tell them about the pregnancy. They also worry about their future child not meeting the other side of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user left the family due to abuse and control, so their hesitation is understandable. The question is whether they're in the wrong for keeping the pregnancy secret. \n\nIn most cases, family dynamics and personal safety are key factors. If the family is abusive and hostile, it's reasonable for the person to prioritize their own and their child's well-being. There's no obligation to stay in contact with abusive relatives. The user has a right to protect themselves and their child from potential harm. \n\nThe user mentions feeling guilty, but guilt here might stem from societal expectations rather than actual wrongdoing. They haven't been in contact, so the family can't genuinely claim they were kept in the dark. Also, the user is concerned about the child's future treatment, which is valid. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong). They are justified in not telling their family if it's for their safety and the child's. The situation involves abuse, so prioritizing their well-being over family expectations makes sense. The user is protecting themselves and their child, which is a responsible choice.\n"
