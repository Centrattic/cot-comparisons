We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. The family isn't on speaking terms except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. They ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling and abusive environment. The mother is described as narcissistic, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. The family is extremely religious and controlling.\n\nThe person is now in a happy relationship and has a stable life. They feel guilty for not telling their family but are terrified of their reaction. They're worried about the baby not knowing the family and potential future issues. The boyfriend hasn't pushed them to tell. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not telling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family dynamics. The family was abusive and controlling. The person left to escape that environment. Contact is minimal and hostile. The person's well-being is a priority here. In such cases, cutting off toxic family members can be necessary for mental health. The person's decision to not engage might be a form of self-preservation.\n\nThe guilt arises from the idea of \"hiding\" the pregnancy. But if the family hasn't been in regular contact and has been hostile when they do reach out, the person isn't hiding it in the traditional sense. They might be protecting themselves and their unborn child from potential harm. The baby's well-being is also a factor here. The person fears the family might treat the child the same way they were treated, which is a valid concern given the history.\n\nThe options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the abusive background, the person's decision to not inform the family is likely a protective measure. They're not in the wrong for prioritizing their safety and their child's safety. The answer would lean towards B.\n"
