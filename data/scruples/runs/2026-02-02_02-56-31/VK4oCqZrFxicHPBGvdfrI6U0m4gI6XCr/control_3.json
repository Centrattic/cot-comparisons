Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging her too hard and even kissing her, despite the daughter's protests. The author argues that it's legitimate force in a situation of unwanted physical contact, while the spouse thinks the kid should just tell a teacher and not use any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and understanding of the child. A 4-year-old might not fully grasp the concept of consent or appropriate ways to handle such situations. The other child's behavior is concerning\u2014forceful hugs and kisses that the daughter indicates are uncomfortable. The teachers aren't effective in stopping it, which adds to the problem.\n\nThe parent's advice is to use physical force to push away if the other child doesn't stop, even suggesting pushing back or running away if the other child retaliates. The spouse argues against any use of violence, advocating for reporting instead. \n\nI should think about child development here. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to express discomfort. Teaching a child to use physical force might escalate the situation or confuse the child about when it's okay to use force. On the other hand, the parent's intention is to protect their child from unwanted contact, which is valid. But is teaching a child to push someone else the right approach?\n\nAlso, the daycare's role is important. The teachers aren't catching it, but maybe there's a need to address the daycare's policies or involve them more effectively. However, the parent feels they've already tried that. \n\nAnother angle: the other child's behavior might indicate something else, like not understanding personal space or having different social norms. The author might be right in teaching the child to set boundaries, but using physical force could be seen as encouraging aggression. However, the parent specifies \"legit force\" in self-defense, not attacking. \n\nI need to weigh the pros and cons. Teaching a child to stand up for themselves is good, but the method matters. Pushing might be a form of violence, but in this context, it's a defensive action. The key is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for the child's age and the situation. Some experts might say that for young children, verbal cues and seeking help are better, but if those aren't working, maybe a physical response is justified. \n\nBut there's also the risk of the child using force in other situations. The parent emphasizes the difference between defense and unprovoked violence, which is important. The spouse's concern is valid too\u2014introducing physical solutions might model aggressive behavior. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's approach might be seen as teaching necessary self-protection in a specific context, but others might argue that even at 4, pushing isn't the right solution and that the daycare should handle it better. The answer could depend on cultural views on child-rearing and how to handle peer interactions. However, given the scenario, the parent's intention is protective, even if the method is debated. So whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on the perspective.\n"
