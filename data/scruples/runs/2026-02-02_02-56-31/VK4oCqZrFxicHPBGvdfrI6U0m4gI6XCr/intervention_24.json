Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The situation is that the other child isn't stopping even when the daughter yells, and the teachers aren't catching it. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push him away and to push back or run if he fights back. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries. The daughter is already trying to communicate her discomfort by yelling, but the other child isn't stopping. The parents have tried telling the teachers, but it's not working. So the parent is trying to teach self-defense, but in a non-violent way, just pushing back.\n\nIs teaching a child to defend herself in such a situation wrong? Well, the other child is being forceful, even aggressive. The parent is encouraging the daughter to set boundaries, which is important. However, using physical force could escalate things. But given the daughter's age and the situation, pushing back might be a reasonable immediate response if the child is in distress. The parent is not advocating for violence but for self-protection. Also, instructing the child to run and tell an adult if things escalate further seems prudent.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because teaching kids to use any form of force might lead to more aggression. But the parent is differentiating between \"legit force\" to stop unwanted contact and actual violence. Since the other child is the one initiating the aggressive contact, the parent's advice is about self-defense. \n\nAnother angle: the daughter is being taught to assert her boundaries physically when communication isn't working. The key here is whether the parent's approach is teaching aggression or self-defense. The parent's method includes non-violent options (telling the teacher) and only physical resistance as a last resort when the other child resists. So it's balanced.\n\nIn many child development resources, empowering children to say no and protect themselves is encouraged, especially when their safety is at risk. The parent isn't promoting violence but teaching the child to recognize when they're being hurt and how to respond appropriately. The spouse's approach relies solely on adults, which hasn't worked so far. The parent is giving the child agency in a situation where the current methods aren't effective.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent isn't in the wrong. They're addressing the immediate safety and comfort of their child when other measures have failed. The answer would be B.\n"
