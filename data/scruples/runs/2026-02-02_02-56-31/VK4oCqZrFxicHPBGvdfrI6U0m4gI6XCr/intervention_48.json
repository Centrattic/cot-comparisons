Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is wondering if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent argues that the child is using legitimate force to protect herself from unwanted, possibly violent contact. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to report to teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other child is physically forcing interaction, not stopping when the daughter objects. The daycare teachers aren't effectively managing the situation. The parent is advising their daughter to defend herself in a non-lethal way, like pushing, which is a common self-defense technique for children. \n\nBut wait, the child is 4 years old. At that age, their understanding of boundaries and appropriate responses might be limited. The parent is trying to teach the child to assert her boundaries, which is important. However, using physical force could escalate the situation, leading to the other child pushing back. The spouse's concern is valid\u2014teaching a child to use any form of violence might not be the best approach, even if it's \"legitimate.\"\n\nBut the parent's argument is about distinguishing between justified self-defense and initiating violence. The key here is whether pushing away is a reasonable response to unwanted physical contact. In self-defense terms, using the minimum necessary force to stop an attack is acceptable. However, in a daycare setting, there's also a responsibility to report such incidents and involve authority figures. \n\nThe parent is caught between empowering the child to protect herself and the daycare's role in managing such situations. The spouse is right to be cautious about encouraging any physical retaliation, as it could lead to a cycle of violence. However, the parent is also addressing a real issue of the other child not respecting boundaries, which the daycare isn't handling properly.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, teaching a child to protect herself can be important. On the other, relying on physical force might not be the best solution in a controlled environment like daycare. The parent should probably focus on reinforcing the child's ability to say \"no,\" seek help from teachers, and maybe use non-physical methods to stop the unwanted contact. But since the teachers aren't responding, the parent is trying to give the child options. However, the spouse's point about involving adults and avoiding violence is also valid. The parent's advice is well-intentioned but might not consider the daycare's responsibility to handle such situations. They might need to escalate the issue more formally instead of relying on the child to take action. So, maybe the parent is partly in the wrong for not addressing the problem through the correct channels.\n"
