Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The main points are that the other child is being uncomfortable, the teachers aren't addressing it, and the parent is advising the child to use force if necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. The parent is teaching their daughter to push back or run away, which is a form of self-defense. But does that set a bad precedent for a young child? On the other hand, the situation described is about personal boundaries and safety. The other child isn't just hugging but doing it in a way that's causing discomfort, even after being told to stop. The parent's approach seems to be about teaching the child to protect herself when others aren't listening.\n\nThe spouse disagrees, thinking the child should only tell a teacher. However, the teachers aren't effective here. The parent argues that the child needs to recognize when it's \"legit violence\" and act accordingly. But is it appropriate to teach a 4-year-old to use force? Maybe there's a balance between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggressive behavior. The parent's advice might be necessary in this specific case, but could it lead to issues if generalized? The answer might depend on the context and how the advice is framed. The parent emphasizes that it's only in cases of violence, which is a valid point. However, ensuring the child knows that the goal is to stop the uncomfortable behavior without escalating is important. So, considering all this, I think the parent isn't in the wrong here because they're addressing a real safety concern for their child.\n"
