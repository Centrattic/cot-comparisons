Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her forcefully. They had a conflict with their spouse over this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is being overly aggressive, hugging and kissing the daughter without her consent. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent is teaching the child to use force to stop the unwanted contact, which they call \"legit violence.\" The spouse is against any violence, even in self-defense, and prefers the child to report it instead.\n\nThe key points here are consent, safety, and age-appropriate responses. At 4 years old, a child might not have the physical or emotional capability to handle a confrontation. Pushing back could escalate the situation, especially if the other child is also around 4 but described as \"rebellious\" and possibly more aggressive. The parent's advice includes pushing back, even if it might lead to retaliation, and then running away and telling an adult. The spouse thinks reporting is better.\n\nIn terms of parenting strategies, teaching a young child to use force might be risky. It's important to consider the child's ability to understand and execute the advice safely. Also, the daycare teachers' inability to intervene adequately adds another layer. The parent is trying to empower the child, but the spouse is worried about promoting violence.\n\nLegally and ethically, a child has the right to protect themselves from unwanted contact. However, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best approach. It's possible that the daycare should be more proactive in addressing the behavior, perhaps by separating the children or providing more supervision during interactions. The parent might need to discuss this with the daycare again, emphasizing the child's discomfort and the need for intervention.\n\nThe spouse's concern about violence is valid. Encouraging a child to push someone could lead to a cycle of aggression. However, the parent is trying to teach the child to assert her boundaries. The balance between teaching self-defense and avoiding violence is tricky, especially with such young children.\n\nIn terms of age-appropriate solutions, maybe there are other ways to help the child. For example, role-playing scenarios with the child to practice saying \"no\" firmly, or finding a non-confrontational way to move away. The daycare might also need to implement strategies to prevent the other child from engaging in such behavior, like redirecting his attention or setting clear boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent's approach might be well-intentioned but could be too aggressive for a 4-year-old. The spouse's preference for reporting and non-violent solutions might be more suitable. The parent might be in the right in wanting to protect their child but could be handling it in a way that's too much for the child's age and the situation's context.\n"
