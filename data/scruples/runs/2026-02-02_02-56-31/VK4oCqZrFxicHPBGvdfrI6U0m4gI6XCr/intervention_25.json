Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's forcing unwanted hugs and kisses on her. The spouse thinks they should just rely on telling the teachers, while the parent argues that it's about using necessary force to stop violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is being aggressive, not respecting boundaries, and the teachers aren't effective. The parent wants their daughter to protect herself. At 4, kids are learning about personal space and how to handle conflicts. Teaching a child to assertively push away could be about self-defense, but there's also the risk of escalating the situation if the other child retaliates. \n\nThe parent mentions that they emphasize non-violence generally but see this as an exception for \"legit violence.\" The spouse is concerned about promoting violence in general. It's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding physical conflict. \n\nIn child development, teaching children to set boundaries is important. However, the method matters. Telling a 4-year-old to push back might lead to more physical altercations, which could be dangerous if the other child is stronger or more aggressive. Also, daycare staff might have protocols for such issues, and relying solely on the child to handle it might not be the best approach. \n\nBut the parent's intention is to protect their child from uncomfortable and potentially harmful situations. The key is whether the response is proportionate. Pushing away to stop a hug might be seen as reasonable self-defense by some, but others might argue that even that is unnecessary violence. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The daughter already tried telling the teachers, but that didn't work. The parent might feel they need to empower the child to handle it herself. However, the spouse is right to caution against normalizing physical responses. Maybe a middle ground would involve more collaboration with the daycare, parents of the other child, and perhaps teaching the daughter verbal assertiveness techniques instead of physical ones. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the parent isn't entirely in the wrong because they're trying to protect their child's well-being. However, the advice could be improved. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) but with the note that there's room for better strategies.\n"
