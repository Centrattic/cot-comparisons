Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent argues it's about using legitimate force to stop unwanted contact, while the spouse thinks she should avoid violence and just tell a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four-year-olds are still developing their understanding of boundaries and appropriate behavior. The parent is trying to teach self-defense, but at such a young age, the child might not fully grasp the nuances of using force appropriately. The other child's actions are described as violent hugs and kisses that the daughter finds uncomfortable, even after she tells the other to stop. The teachers haven't been effective in stopping the behavior, so the parent feels the need to empower the daughter to protect herself.\n\nHowever, teaching a 4-year-old to push back could escalate the situation. Young children might not know how to de-escalate a conflict once they start using force. The spouse's concern is valid because teaching non-violence is important, even if it's a difficult situation. Also, there's a risk that the daughter might be labeled as the aggressor if she pushes the other kid, especially since both are young and adults might not see the incident.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to teach the child to recognize and stand up against unwanted physical contact, which is an important lesson in personal boundaries. The parent isn't advocating for aggressive violence but for defensive actions in a situation where the child is being harmed. The daughter is already aware of the problem and has tried telling the teachers, but that hasn't worked. So the parent is offering a practical solution given the circumstances.\n\nBut considering child development, the appropriate approach might be to reinforce non-violent communication and ensure that the teachers are more vigilant. The parent's advice might be too advanced for a 4-year-old, who might not understand when to use force and when not to. There's also the risk of the child acting out in fear or confusion, leading to more conflict.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, many would argue that even in such situations, children should be taught to avoid violence and rely on adults for help. However, in cases where the child is being physically harmed and the adults aren't intervening effectively, teaching self-defense could be seen as necessary. The key is balancing the child's safety with appropriate behavior.\n\nI think the parent is trying to address a real problem but might be giving advice that's too complex for a 4-year-old. The spouse's concern about resorting to violence is valid, especially given the child's age. So, the parent might be in the wrong by not fully considering the child's developmental stage and the potential consequences of using force. The correct approach might be to work more closely with the daycare to ensure the problem is resolved without encouraging violent responses.\n"
