Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The parent encourages the child to push back if the other kid won't stop even after she tells him to. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being hugged in a way that's making her uncomfortable, even painful. The other child isn't stopping even when told. The teachers aren't catching it. The parent is teaching the child to use force to protect herself. But the spouse is concerned about promoting violence.\n\nSo, the question is whether teaching a 4-year-old to push someone away and push back is appropriate. At that age, kids might not fully understand boundaries or how to handle conflicts. On one hand, the parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself from unwanted contact, which is a valid concern, especially if it's persistent and the adults aren't intervening. On the other hand, using physical force could escalate the situation or get the child in trouble. The parent emphasizes \"legit violence\" in self-defense, but a 4-year-old might not grasp the nuances of when it's appropriate to use force.\n\nAlso, the child is already telling teachers, but they aren't effective. The parent might feel that the child needs more immediate tools. But some might argue that teaching a child to use physical force could lead to more aggressive behavior or that there are other ways to handle it, like removing herself from the situation or using words more effectively. The parent's approach might be seen as appropriate for self-defense in a threatening situation, but with a young child, there's risk in the child misapplying the advice.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and moral aspect. In some contexts, self-defense is justified, but teaching a 4-year-old this could be tricky. The parent is trying to teach her to recognize when her boundaries are violated and how to respond, which is part of teaching consent and body autonomy from an early age. However, the spouse's concern is valid because encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense, could set a bad precedent.\n\nI think the parent's intention is good, but the method might be problematic. At 4 years old, children are still learning social skills, and introducing physical responses might not be the best approach. The parent could have focused on teaching the child to clearly say \"no,\" use her words, and remove herself from the situation, while continuing to work with the daycare to address the behavior. The spouse's point about telling the teachers is important because even if the teachers aren't effective now, consistent communication might lead to better monitoring.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's concern is valid and the intention is protective, the method of teaching physical force might be inappropriate for a 4-year-old. The parent might be overstepping by encouraging violence, even if it's self-defense. So the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
