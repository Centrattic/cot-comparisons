Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push another kid who's giving her violent hugs and kisses. The main issue is whether teaching a child to use physical force to defend herself is appropriate.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a 4-year-old who's being uncomfortable with another child's aggressive behavior. The daughter has already tried telling the teachers, but the other kid isn't stopping. The parent is telling her that it's okay to push the kid away if it's happening and causing her discomfort. The spouse disagrees, arguing that she should only tell adults and avoid violence.\n\nSo, the parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself in a situation where the other child isn't respecting her boundaries. The concern raised by the spouse is about the use of any violence, even in self-defense. But the parent is differentiating between legitimate defense and unprovoked aggression. They mentioned that the child is old enough to understand the difference between appropriate and inappropriate force.\n\nI need to consider child development here. At 4 years old, children are still learning social skills and how to express their feelings. Teaching a child to push back could be seen as encouraging aggression, which might lead to more problems. However, the parent is trying to teach self-defense and boundary setting. There's a balance between teaching a child to protect themselves and not promoting violent behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the role of adults. The parent acknowledges that the teachers haven't been effective, so maybe the parent is trying to ensure their child can handle the situation. But some might argue that it's the responsibility of the daycare to manage such behavior and that parents shouldn't escalate it by teaching their kids to fight back.\n\nAlso, the specific advice given is to push away, not to hit or fight. It's a minimal force to stop an uncomfortable situation. The parent mentions running away and telling an adult as options too. So it's not just about using violence but also about de-escalation strategies.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because even minor physical actions can be seen as bullying or escalate conflicts. However, the parent's approach is about respecting the child's autonomy and safety. It's a tricky situation where both perspectives have merit.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and parenting advice, many sources suggest that children should learn to say \"no\" and seek help when needed. Physical intervention might be discouraged unless it's absolutely necessary for safety. However, if a child is in immediate danger, teaching them to protect themselves is important.\n\nThe key here is whether the force advised is proportional and necessary. Pushing someone away to stop an unwanted hug might be considered reasonable self-defense, especially if the other child isn't responding to verbal cues. The parent is emphasizing that it's okay to defend oneself when someone is being violent or causing distress.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, the parent's intention is to help their child set boundaries and feel safe. However, the spouse's concern about encouraging violence is also valid. The answer might depend on cultural context and the specific situation's severity. If the other child's actions are truly harmful and persistent, then the parent's advice could be justified. But if it's more about social awkwardness, teaching physical resistance might not be the best approach. The parent might not be in the wrong, but they should also consider reinforcing non-violent solutions and ensuring the daycare addresses the issue more effectively.\n"
