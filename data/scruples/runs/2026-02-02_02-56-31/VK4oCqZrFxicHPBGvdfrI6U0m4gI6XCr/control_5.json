Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and kissing her when she doesn't want to. The parent also mentioned that the daughter should push back or run away if the other kid responds aggressively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Four years old is very young, and their understanding of boundaries and consequences is still developing. The parent is trying to teach self-defense, but maybe the approach isn't age-appropriate. \n\nThe other child's behavior is described as violent and persistent even after being told by teachers. The parent's intention is to protect their daughter from uncomfortable situations. However, teaching a 4-year-old to push back might escalate the conflict. At that age, kids might not have the emotional regulation or the ability to judge force appropriately. Pushing could lead to more aggression from the other child, as the daughter feared.\n\nThe parent's spouse is concerned about using violence, advocating instead for relying on adults. There's a balance between teaching a child to set boundaries and encouraging violence. The parent argues it's \"legit force,\" but for a young child, the line between defense and aggression is blurry. Also, if the daughter acts on this advice, there could be repercussions at daycare, like the other child's parents getting involved or the situation worsening.\n\nDevelopmentally, 4-year-olds might not have the problem-solving skills to handle such scenarios. The parent's advice might be too advanced for her age. Maybe there are alternative strategies, like teaching the daughter to say \"no\" firmly, or using a safe word to signal adults, rather than physical contact.\n\nAdditionally, the daycare's role here is important. If the teachers are aware but can't manage the situation, maybe there's a need for more intervention from the daycare staff, rather than the child taking matters into her own hands. The parent's approach might bypass the system meant to protect children, relying on the child to handle a problem that's beyond her developmental stage.\n\nSo, while the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, the method might be inappropriate for a 4-year-old. The spouse's concern about encouraging violence is valid. The parent might not be in the wrong entirely, but they might not be right either. It's a tough situation where both perspectives have valid points. The key issue is whether the advice is suitable for the child's age and the potential consequences. The parent's answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to protect their child from harm, but others might argue it's A (in the wrong) because encouraging physical response in a young child isn't appropriate.\n"
