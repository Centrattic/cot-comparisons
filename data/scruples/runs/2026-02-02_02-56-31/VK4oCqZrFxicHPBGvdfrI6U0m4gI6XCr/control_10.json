Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push another kid away who is hugging her too hard and not stopping even when she tells him. The parent argues that it's legitimate self-defense since the other kid is being violent. The spouse thinks the parent should have told the daughter to just tell the teachers and not use any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being hugged forcefully and kissed when she doesn't want it. The daycare isn't effective in stopping it. The parent's advice is to push back or run and tell an adult. The spouse is against any form of violence, even if it's to defend herself.\n\nNow, I need to think about child psychology and appropriate responses. At 4 years old, how do children typically handle such situations? Maybe they aren't expected to use physical force. But the parent is talking about self-defense. However, teaching a child to push back might escalate the situation. The other child might retaliate, leading to more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their daughter from unwanted physical contact. The parent believes the child is smart enough to discern when it's appropriate. But is physical force ever acceptable for a 4-year-old? Maybe not. Adults usually step in, but in this case, the teachers aren't effective. So the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself.\n\nBut there's a risk that teaching a child to use physical force could lead to her becoming aggressive in other contexts. It's a fine line between self-defense and encouraging violence. The spouse is concerned about the violence angle. The parent argues it's legitimate force when someone is being violent.\n\nI should consider guidelines for child behavior. Most parenting advice suggests teaching children to say \"no\" and tell a grown-up. Physical pushing might not be recommended. Also, at 4 years old, the child might not have the judgment to assess when it's appropriate to push. What if she misuses it?\n\nThe daycare's role is important too. If the teachers aren't addressing the issue, the parent should probably talk to them more or the daycare director. Maybe the solution isn't about the child's response but about the daycare's intervention.\n\nSo, the parent's approach might be well-intentioned but possibly inappropriate. Teaching a child to push back could lead to more problems. The spouse's stance on non-violence is more aligned with typical child safety advice. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical confrontation instead of focusing on communication and adult intervention.\n"
