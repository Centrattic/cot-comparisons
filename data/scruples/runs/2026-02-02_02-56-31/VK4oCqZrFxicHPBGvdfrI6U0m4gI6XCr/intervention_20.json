Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away a kid who's hugging her too hard and kissing her against her will. The parents had a fight about this, with the SO thinking the daughter should just tell the teachers and not use violence at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being physically uncomfortable by another kid, and the teachers aren't effectively addressing it. The parent's response was to teach the daughter to protect herself with a bit of force if necessary. The daughter is already aware of the problem and has told the teachers, but the behavior continues.\n\nNow, the key points here. At 4 years old, children are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent is trying to empower their child to set personal boundaries, which is important. However, the other parent is concerned about encouraging violence, even if it's defensive. \n\nThere's a difference between teaching a child to stand up for themselves and encouraging aggression. The parent clarified that they're not advocating for beating others up, just using \"legit force\" in self-defense. The daughter was also taught to run and tell an adult if needed. \n\nBut at 4 years old, the child might not fully understand the difference between self-defense and aggression. Their response to the daughter's fear about the other kid pushing back suggests using force again. There's a risk that the child might escalate the situation, especially since both kids are young and might not handle it properly. \n\nAlso, the role of the daycare teachers is important. If they're not addressing the issue, maybe the parents should involve them more directly, perhaps by having a conversation with the teachers and the other child's parents. The parent might be overstepping by teaching self-defense at such a young age, as the child's ability to assess the situation and respond appropriately is still developing. \n\nHowever, the parent is trying to protect their daughter from uncomfortable and potentially harmful situations. Teaching her to push away could be a way to prevent her from being a victim of unwanted physical contact. It's about balance. \n\nIn child development, it's crucial to teach children to express their discomfort and use words. Physical responses might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old, as they can lead to more conflict. The SO's approach of relying on adults to intervene is also valid. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're protecting their child. On the other hand, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best method. The answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because encouraging even self-defense at that age can be problematic. Young children might not distinguish between appropriate and excessive force, and it could lead to more issues. The better approach might have been to reinforce communication with the teachers and maybe work with the other parents or the daycare to address the behavior without involving physical responses.\n"
