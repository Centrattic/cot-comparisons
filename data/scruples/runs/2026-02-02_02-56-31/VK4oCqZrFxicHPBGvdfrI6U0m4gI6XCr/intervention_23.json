Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed by another kid in a way that's making her uncomfortable. The parent encouraged the daughter to push the other child away if he's being too forceful, even suggesting that if the other kid pushes back, she should push back or run to an adult. The spouse disagreed, thinking she should just tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning how to handle social interactions and express their boundaries. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to stand up for herself when someone is being too aggressive. But is encouraging a child to physically push back appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to set boundaries is important. If the other child is being forceful and the teachers aren't intervening effectively, the parent might feel that empowering their daughter to protect herself is necessary. The parent emphasizes using \"legit force\" in situations where the other child is being violent, not just any situation.\n\nOn the other hand, at such a young age, children might not have the impulse control to differentiate between appropriate defense and aggression. Even if the parent is clear, the child might misinterpret the message and use violence inappropriately. The spouse is concerned about normalizing violence, even in self-defense, for a 4-year-old. Also, in many educational settings, any form of physical retaliation is discouraged to prevent escalating conflicts and to teach non-violent problem-solving.\n\nThe parent mentions that the daughter already tried telling the teachers but they didn't effectively address the issue. So, the parent is trying to fill a gap where the school isn't helping. However, the recommended approach in such cases is usually to involve adults more consistently, perhaps through more direct communication with the teachers or parents of the other child, rather than allowing the child to handle it physically.\n\nThere's also the aspect of teaching conflict resolution skills. While physical intervention might be necessary in extreme cases (like abuse), for a daycare situation, other strategies might be more appropriate. The daughter could be taught to use her voice more assertively, to seek help immediately, or to remove herself from the situation.\n\nThe spouse's concern that teaching a child to use violence could lead to a cycle of aggression is valid. Young children often act in the moment and might not understand the nuances of when it's okay to push back. The parent's approach might be well-intentioned, but the risk is that the child could end up in more trouble at daycare or escalate the situation with the other child.\n\nHowever, the parent is also trying to protect their child from uncomfortable and potentially harmful interactions. The line between playful behavior and violence can be blurry for young children, and the parent is helping their daughter recognize that boundary. The key is whether the parent's advice is proportionate and clear.\n\nIn many child development guidelines, teaching children to say \"no\" and to walk away is encouraged, rather than using physical force. Physical responses are generally discouraged unless it's a case of serious harm, which might not be the case here. The daycare's role is to manage such interactions and ensure all children feel safe, so the parent might need to work more closely with the daycare staff to find a solution instead of instructing their child to defend herself physically.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's intentions are good, but the method might not be the best for a 4-year-old. The spouse's perspective is more aligned with standard child-rearing advice that avoids teaching children to use violence, even in self-defense. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical retaliation in this situation.\n"
