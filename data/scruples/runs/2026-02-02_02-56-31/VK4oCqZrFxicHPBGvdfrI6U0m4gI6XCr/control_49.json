Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and kissing her without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other child is a same-age peer at daycare, and the behavior is described as \"violent hugging\" and forced kisses. The daughter has already told the teachers, but the teachers aren't seeing it, and the child isn't stopping. The parent is advising the daughter to use force to push back if the other kid won't stop, even suggesting pushing back or running away if the other child retaliates. \n\nThe parent's spouse is upset because they believe the child should only use non-violent methods like telling the teachers. The parent argues that it's about using necessary force in a situation where someone is forcing themselves onto her, and that the child is old enough to understand the difference between necessary force and random violence.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. From a child safety perspective, allowing a child to defend themselves from unwanted physical contact is important. Teaching a child to set boundaries and protect themselves can be crucial, especially when adults aren't effectively intervening. However, there's also the aspect of teaching non-violent conflict resolution and considering the other child's behavior. \n\nIn some cases, encouraging a child to fight back might escalate the situation or lead to the child being seen as aggressive. On the other hand, if the other child is genuinely aggressive and not respecting the daughter's boundaries despite previous interventions, the parent's advice could be seen as protective. \n\nI should also consider if pushing is an age-appropriate response. At 4 years old, children might not handle physical confrontation well, and it's possible that teaching non-physical ways to handle it might be better. But given that the other methods (telling teachers) haven't worked, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the parent's intention is to protect their child from unwanted physical contact, which is a valid concern. The advice given is to use necessary force in a specific context where there's a threat. However, teaching a child to use physical force might have unintended consequences, like making the child aggressive. But in this case, the parent is not advocating for violence in general, just in a specific situation where the other child is being violent.\n\nI think the parent is in the right here because they're addressing their child's safety and teaching her to set boundaries. The spouse's concern is valid too, but the parent's approach is more about self-defense in a specific scenario. So the answer would be B (No), the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
