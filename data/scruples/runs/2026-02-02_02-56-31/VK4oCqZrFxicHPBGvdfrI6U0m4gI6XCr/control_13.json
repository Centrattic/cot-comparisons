Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe parent is talking about their 4-year-old daughter who's in daycare. Another kid keeps hugging her and kissing her in a way that's making the daughter uncomfortable. The parent encourages the daughter to push the other kid away if he's being too forceful, even suggesting pushing back if the other kid reacts. The spouse is upset, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young. Their understanding of boundaries and how to handle situations isn't fully developed. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself. But does teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force to defend herself open the door to more violence or escalate the situation? \n\nOn one hand, the parent is right that the daughter is being physically uncomfortable, and the daycare isn't handling it. If the teachers aren't intervening, the child might feel helpless. Teaching the child to assert her boundaries is important. But at 4, pushing or pushing back might not be the best solution. It could lead to a physical fight, which is more dangerous. Also, the parent mentions the daughter is \"very straight in raising\" regarding violence, so the parent isn't encouraging random aggression, but specific self-defense.\n\nHowever, the spouse's concern is valid too. Encouraging a young child to use force might not be appropriate. The child might not have the judgment to assess when it's necessary, or how to do it without causing harm. Also, the daycare setting usually has protocols for such issues, and bypassing those could be problematic if there's an incident.\n\nAnother angle: the parent is trying to empower the child to stand up for herself, which is a good lesson. But at 4, the child might not know how to articulate her discomfort effectively. Maybe other strategies, like teaching her to say \"no\" firmly, or to go to a teacher immediately if the other child doesn't stop, would be better. \n\nThe parent's approach might be seen as overstepping because physical retaliation isn't typical for preschoolers' conflict resolution. It's possible that the daycare isn't handling it properly, but that's more about the daycare's responsibility than the parent's advice. However, teaching a child to use force could lead to disciplinary issues or the child being labeled as aggressive if she pushes someone, even in self-defense.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? It's a tough call. They're trying to protect their child, which is instinctual, but the method might not be developmentally appropriate. The spouse's concern about using violence at all is valid, especially considering the child's age and lack of judgment. The parent might not be entirely wrong, but maybe they could have explored other solutions first, like working more closely with the daycare, or teaching non-physical ways to assert boundaries.\n\nIn the end, maybe the parent's approach is too direct for a 4-year-old. The answer could be that the parent is in the wrong because encouraging physical force isn't suitable for such a young child, even if the intent is good. But I'm a bit conflicted because the situation involves a child being uncomfortable and not getting help from teachers. Still, the appropriate response for a 4-year-old might be different.\n"
