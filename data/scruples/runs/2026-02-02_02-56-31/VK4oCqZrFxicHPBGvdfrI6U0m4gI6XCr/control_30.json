  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for encouraging my 4y/o to push away another kid who keeps violently hugging her?\nJust had a fight with my SO because of what I told our daughter about \"legit violence\". Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged too hard and kissed by another kid at daycare. The parent told the child it's okay to push the other kid away if it's uncomfortable, even suggesting pushing back or running away if the other kid retaliates. The spouse is upset, saying they should only tell the teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to express their feelings. The parent is trying to teach self-defense, but maybe that's too advanced for a 4-year-old. The child might not understand the difference between appropriate force and violence, especially at that age. Pushing someone could escalate a situation, leading to more conflict or injury.\n\nAlso, daycare settings have rules and protocols for handling such issues. The teachers are responsible for supervising and mediating interactions between children. If the child is encouraged to push the other kid, even to stop unwanted contact, it might undermine the teachers' authority and the structured environment meant to keep children safe. The parent might be overstepping by not relying on the daycare staff to handle it.\n\nAnother angle is the message the parent is sending. Teaching a child to use physical force to solve problems, even in self-defense, could set a precedent for future behavior. It's important to model non-violent conflict resolution. However, the parent is also trying to protect their daughter from uncomfortable or potentially harmful situations, which is a natural instinct.\n\nBut the child's understanding of force versus violence might not be clear. The parent says they emphasized \"legit violence,\" but a 4-year-old might not grasp that nuance. The spouse's concern is valid because the daycare might have procedures in place, and the parent's advice could lead to unintended consequences if the child acts aggressively.\n\nIn terms of the daycare's role, if they aren't catching the behavior even after being told, maybe there's a need for better communication or additional strategies. However, the parent's solution might not be the best approach given the child's age and the context.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent's advice might not be appropriate for a 4-year-old. The spouse's approach of relying on teachers and avoiding any use of violence aligns more with developmental guidelines for young children. The parent is in the wrong because their advice risks teaching aggression and not trusting the daycare's role in the child's safety.\n"
