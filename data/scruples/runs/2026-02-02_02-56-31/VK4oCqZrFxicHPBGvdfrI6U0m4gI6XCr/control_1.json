Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly and not stopping when she tells him to. The main issue here is about teaching a child to use physical force as a response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is being aggressive, not respecting her boundaries, and even after she yells at him and tells the teachers, it doesn't stop. The parent is telling their daughter that it's okay to push back to protect herself. The spouse argues that using violence is never the solution and that she should just tell the teachers. \n\nI remember that in child development, teaching kids to use force can have mixed implications. On one hand, it's important for a child to understand their personal boundaries and how to assert themselves. On the other hand, encouraging physical responses early on might model behavior that could lead to more aggression. However, in this case, the parent is specifically teaching the child to use \"legit force\" when she's being hurt and the other child isn't stopping. \n\nAnother angle is the child's ability to understand the difference between self-defense and aggression. The parent mentions that the daughter is 4, which is young, but the parent believes she's smart enough to distinguish. The spouse might be worried that the child could escalate things or get hurt in the process, especially if the other kid pushes back.\n\nAlso, the daycare's role is mentioned\u2014they don't see the incidents and can't stop the other kid. So the parent is trying to give their daughter a tool to protect herself when adults can't intervene effectively. The parent isn't advocating for hitting or fighting, just pushing away in that moment and then telling an adult. \n\nI think there's a balance here. Teaching a child to stand up for herself is important, but using physical force could have unintended consequences. However, given the context that the other child isn't respecting her boundaries and the teachers aren't effective, the parent's advice might be a form of self-advocacy. \n\nBut some might argue that even in this situation, teaching non-violent responses like walking away or seeking help is better. The parent's approach could be seen as promoting a cycle of violence. However, since the child is being physically forced into actions against her will, the parent's instruction is about self-protection rather than initiating violence. \n\nI'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong because they're addressing a specific, ongoing issue where other methods haven't worked. They're not teaching general violence but a specific response to being harmed. The key is that the parent is emphasizing using force only when necessary and then reporting it, which is a responsible approach. So the answer might be B.\n"
