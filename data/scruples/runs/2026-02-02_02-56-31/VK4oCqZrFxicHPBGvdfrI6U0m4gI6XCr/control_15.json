Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent was wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who was hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent's spouse thinks it's better to tell a teacher, but the parent argues that using force to stop violence is okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being hugged/kissed in a way that's uncomfortable and even painful at times. The other child doesn't stop even when told by adults. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself, which seems reasonable. However, the parent is also teaching the daughter to use physical force, which could escalate the situation. \n\nBut wait, the parent mentions that they didn't encourage violence in general, just \"legit force\" in a specific situation where the other child is being violent. They also told the daughter to run away and tell an adult if needed. So the advice includes both self-defense and reporting.\n\nThe key here is whether teaching a child to use force in self-defense is appropriate. At 4 years old, a child's ability to assess and respond appropriately might be limited. However, the parent is trying to empower the daughter to protect herself when other methods (telling the teachers) haven't worked. \n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because using physical force could lead to retaliation. But the parent's argument is that in cases of unwanted physical contact, especially when it's violent and persistent, the child should have the tools to defend herself. \n\nI also need to consider child development. A 4-year-old might not fully understand how to use force appropriately. However, the parent is teaching a specific, controlled response, not general violence. It's about setting boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: the child has already been advised to tell the teachers, but that hasn't stopped the behavior. The parent is stepping in because the current measures aren't effective. The advice given is a form of self-defense, which is a common teaching in many parenting approaches. \n\nBut there's a risk that the child might misinterpret the advice and use it inappropriately. However, the parent is emphasizing the context\u2014only when someone is hurting her and not stopping. The parent also included a plan B (run away and tell an adult), which is good.\n\nIn terms of whether it's wrong, it's a balance between teaching self-defense and avoiding violence. Since the parent is being specific about the situation and providing alternatives, it might not be in the wrong. On the other hand, some might argue that even at that age, physical responses should be avoided unless the child is in immediate danger. \n\nBut the hugs and kisses are described as violent and persistent, which could be considered a form of bullying or harassment. The parent is addressing a real problem with a practical solution after other methods have failed. So, the parent's approach seems justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
