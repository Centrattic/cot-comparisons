Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and even kissing her. The partner disagrees, thinking she should rely on teachers and not use violence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is being physically overbearing, and the daughter has already tried to tell the teachers, but it's not working. The parent taught the daughter to use force if she's being hurt and the other kid won't stop. The partner is concerned about encouraging violence.\n\nFrom a child's perspective, a 4-year-old might not have the skills to handle a physical confrontation. Even if the parent is teaching self-defense, there's a risk that the other child might retaliate, as the daughter mentioned. But the parent argues it's about using \"legit force\" in a situation of violence. \n\nLegally and ethically, teaching a child to defend themselves can be seen as reasonable if the other child is being aggressive. However, the challenge is that young kids don't always assess situations correctly. The daughter might misinterpret a situation or escalate it. Also, schools often have policies against physical responses, so the parent's advice might conflict with the daycare's rules.\n\nOn the other hand, the child's safety and comfort are important. If the daycare isn't addressing the issue, the parent might feel they have to step in. But the partner's point about relying on adults (teachers) is valid because it's the daycare's responsibility to manage such situations. \n\nThere's a balance between teaching a child to stand up for themselves and ensuring they don't become violent. The parent's approach might be seen as justified if it's about immediate safety, but the partner is right to be cautious about promoting violent solutions. \n\nConsidering all factors, maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for a middle ground. Perhaps teaching the child to use their voice more, to seek help immediately, and only as a last resort to push away. However, since the daycare isn't handling it, the parent's advice could be seen as necessary. \n\nStill, the key point is that the daycare should handle such interactions. The parent's instruction might conflict with the daycare's approach. The answer might depend on cultural context and the specific situation's safety. \n\nIn the end, I think the parent is trying to protect their child from harm, which is a natural instinct. But there's a potential risk in teaching a young child to use physical force. So, the answer might lean towards the parent not being entirely in the wrong, but also needing to consider the partner's concerns about proper conflict resolution through adults.\n"
