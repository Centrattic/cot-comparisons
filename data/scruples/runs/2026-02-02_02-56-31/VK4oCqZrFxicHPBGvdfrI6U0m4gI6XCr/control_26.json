Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and kissing her. The parent and their spouse had a disagreement about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is in daycare, and another kid is being physically overbearing, even after the teachers have been told but it hasn't stopped. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push him away if he's being too forceful. The spouse argues that it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence altogether.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age of the child, the nature of the other kid's actions, and the appropriateness of the advice given. The parent is teaching their daughter to use \"legitimate force\" in self-defense. At 4 years old, children are still learning how to handle social situations and may not have the best judgment. Teaching a child to push back could escalate the situation physically. On the other hand, the other child's behavior seems inappropriate\u2014forceful hugs and kisses without consent. The daycare teachers aren't able to stop it effectively, which is a problem.\n\nBut the parent's approach might be seen as encouraging violence, even if it's defensive. However, the parent emphasizes that it's okay to defend oneself when someone won't stop despite being told. The spouse's concern is about avoiding any form of violence. There's a balance between teaching self-defense and promoting aggression.\n\nIn child development, experts often recommend teaching children to use words, seek help, and avoid physical confrontation. However, in cases where a child is being physically forced, there's an argument for allowing them to protect themselves. But since the child is so young, the parent's advice might be too advanced for her to handle appropriately. She might not know how to use proportionate force and could end up harming the other child, leading to more problems.\n\nAlso, the daycare's role is to manage such situations. If they're not effective, the parents should probably take more active steps to address the issue with the daycare staff or the other child's parents, rather than teaching their daughter to handle it physically.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent's advice, while well-intentioned, might not be the best approach. It's better to rely on adults to handle such situations and teach the child to communicate and seek help. So, the parent might be in the wrong (A). However, the other child's behavior is concerning, so maybe the parent isn't entirely at fault. But given the child's age and the potential for escalation, the answer might be A.\n"
