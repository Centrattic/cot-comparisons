Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. The situation is a 4-year-old girl at daycare who's being hugged too hard by another kid, sometimes even kissed without consent. She's tried telling the other kid to stop and told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent advised the daughter that it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being violent, and even to push back or run away if he retaliates. The spouse thinks teaching the child to use violence is wrong, but the parent argues it's about self-defense.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age. A 4-year-old might not fully understand the difference between appropriate and inappropriate physical contact. The parent is trying to teach her to protect herself when someone is being aggressive. However, teaching a child to use violence, even in self-defense, could set a bad precedent. But in this case, the other child is being forceful and not respecting the daughter's boundaries. The parent is emphasizing that it's okay to use force when someone is harming her and won't stop.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse is concerned about encouraging violence. However, the context here is that the other child is being violent, and the daughter is being harmed. The parent is teaching her to defend herself, which is different from starting a fight. The key point is whether the parent is giving good advice for a situation where the child is being physically harmed and the authority figures aren't intervening effectively.\n\nThe daycare teachers aren't seeing the incidents, so the child can't rely on them. The parent's advice might help the child protect herself in the moment. However, there's a risk that the child might escalate the situation. But given the age, maybe the parent is trying to empower the child to assert her boundaries.\n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong here. They're teaching the child to defend herself when there's a clear case of someone being aggressive and not respecting her wishes. The spouse's concern about violence is valid, but this is about self-protection, not starting a conflict. So the answer is B.\n"
