Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is questioning whether they were in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her in a way she finds uncomfortable. The situation involves a daycare child who's not respecting boundaries despite the daughter's attempts to say no and even after being told by adults.\n\nFirst, the parent is teaching their child to use physical force to defend herself when she's being forced into unwanted physical contact. The parent argues it's \"legit force\" in a situation of violence. The spouse is against this, advocating for only reporting to teachers and avoiding violence at all costs.\n\nAt age 4, children are still developing social skills and understanding boundaries. The daycare teachers aren't managing the situation effectively, so the child isn't getting the support she needs. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself, which is a valid concern. However, teaching a child to use physical force could lead to escalated conflicts. The other child might retaliate, as the daughter worried, leading to more harm.\n\nBut the alternative is leaving the child vulnerable to repeated unwanted contact, which isn't healthy. The parent's approach might be a way to teach self-defense and assertiveness. On the other hand, promoting non-violence is also crucial for teaching conflict resolution without aggression.\n\nThere's a balance between teaching a child to stand up for herself and encouraging violence. The parent's instruction seems specific to a situation where the other child is being violent, so it's a form of self-defense. However, for a 4-year-old, the line between appropriate and excessive force might be blurry. The parent might be trying to instill a sense of agency, but there's a risk of normalizing physical responses to conflict.\n\nIn many parenting philosophies, it's encouraged to teach children to express their discomfort and seek help first. The fact that the teachers aren't addressing the issue adequately complicates things. The parent might be filling a gap left by the daycare's failure to protect the child's boundaries.\n\nUltimately, the parent's intention is protective, but the method could have unintended consequences. The spouse's concern is valid because promoting non-violence is important for a child's social development. However, the parent's approach is a response to a real problem that isn't being solved through existing channels. The answer might hinge on whether the parent's advice is seen as necessary self-defense or as encouraging violence.\n"
