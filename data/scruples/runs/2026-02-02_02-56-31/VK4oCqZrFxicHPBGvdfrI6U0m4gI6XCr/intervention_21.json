Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's giving her uncomfortable hugs and kisses. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teacher and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact from another kid, and the parents have already tried telling the teachers without success. The parent is advising the daughter to defend herself by pushing back if the other kid doesn't stop, which could be seen as self-defense. But the parent also mentions they are against violence in general, so it's a specific case where the force is a response to ongoing aggression.\n\nOn the one hand, teaching a child to stand up for themselves and recognize their own boundaries is important. If the other child is being aggressive, the parent might feel that it's necessary to allow their daughter to protect herself, especially if adults aren't intervening effectively. The parent is also emphasizing using force only when the other kid is violating her space, which isn't encouraging violence for its own sake.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse is concerned that teaching a child to use physical force could lead to more problems, like escalation or the child getting into trouble at daycare. There's also the consideration of how to handle such situations in a way that reinforces reporting to adults first. The daycare might have their own protocols, and the parent's advice could conflict with that if the teachers aren't effective in handling the issue.\n\nAnother angle is the developmental aspect. At 4 years old, children are still learning social skills and how to express their feelings. While the daughter is old enough to understand some concepts, the parent's advice might be too direct. Instead of pushing, the child might need more guidance on verbal communication or using non-violent methods, like walking away and seeking help. However, if the other child isn't responding to words or the teachers aren't acting, the parent might feel that allowing self-defense is necessary for the child's safety and confidence.\n\nThe key factors here are the intent behind the parent's advice. They are not promoting violence in general but specific self-defense in a situation where the child is being physically forced. The parent is also teaching the child to assess the situation and use a proportionate response, like pushing back or running away. The spouse's concern is valid, as physical retaliation can sometimes lead to more conflict, but the parent's approach is about immediate self-protection.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The parent isn't wrong in wanting to protect their child and teach her to set boundaries. However, the spouse's perspective about relying on adults and avoiding violence is also a valid approach. It might depend on the daycare's policies and how the situation is handled there. The parent could have perhaps encouraged a combination of both: using words first, then if that fails, a physical response as a last resort, while still emphasizing telling an adult afterward.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intention is to protect their child from unwanted physical contact, which is a legitimate concern. The advice given is specific to a situation where the child is being physically forced, and the parent is teaching the child to assert her boundaries. However, there's a balance between self-defense and encouraging non-violence. So, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but there might be room for a more comprehensive approach that includes both verbal and physical strategies, along with reinforcing the importance of reporting the behavior to adults for resolution.\n"
