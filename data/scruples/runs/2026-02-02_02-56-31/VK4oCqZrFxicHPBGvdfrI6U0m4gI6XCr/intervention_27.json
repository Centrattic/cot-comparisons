Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were wrong to tell their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and kissing her without permission. The spouse thinks it's better to just tell the teachers and not use any violence.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is about a child being physically uncomfortable and the parent's advice on how to handle it. The daughter is already reporting to teachers, but it's not working. The parent is teaching her to use physical force to stop the unwanted contact. The spouse is against any form of violence, even if defensive. \n\nSo, the question is: Is teaching a child to use physical force in self-defense acceptable when the adult supervision isn't effective? \n\nOn one hand, the parent is trying to protect their child from physical discomfort and teach her to assert herself. If the other child is being aggressive and not respecting boundaries, the parent might think it's necessary to empower their daughter to defend herself. \n\nOn the other hand, teaching a child to use violence can have potential downsides. At 4 years old, children are still learning social skills, and physical confrontation might escalate the situation. There's a risk of the child learning that hitting or pushing is acceptable in conflicts, even if it's in self-defense. The spouse's point about reporting to adults is valid too, but since the teachers aren't effective, there's a gap in protection.\n\nHowever, the parent isn't advocating for random violence. They're teaching the child to push back only in specific situations where there's unwanted force. The advice includes running away and telling an adult, which are good strategies. The key here is the distinction between defending oneself from immediate harm versus using violence for other reasons. \n\nIn child development, it's important to teach children to recognize and express their boundaries. If the child is being forced into physical contact she doesn't want, teaching her to remove herself or seek help is crucial. The method of pushing back might be a way to assert her boundaries immediately, especially when the other child isn't heeding her verbal protests. \n\nBut there's a balance. The parent needs to ensure that the child understands the difference between defending against harm and using aggression. The spouse's concern is about normalizing violence, which is a valid point. However, in cases of physical harm or unwanted contact, allowing the child to have tools to protect herself is also important. \n\nIn this case, the parent is not promoting violence as a first step. The child has already tried telling the other kid and the teachers, and when that fails, the parent is giving her options. The advice includes both pushing back and then seeking help. So, the parent is not advocating for violence without reason but as a last resort when other methods fail. \n\nTherefore, considering the situation where the other child is being aggressive and the previous methods aren't working, the parent's advice might be seen as a way to protect the child's autonomy and safety. However, it's also important to continue working with the daycare to address the underlying behavior of the other child. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's approach might not be entirely wrong, especially given the context. But it's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have valid points. The parent is trying to equip the child with necessary tools for immediate protection, while the spouse is concerned about the long-term effects of teaching violence.\n"
