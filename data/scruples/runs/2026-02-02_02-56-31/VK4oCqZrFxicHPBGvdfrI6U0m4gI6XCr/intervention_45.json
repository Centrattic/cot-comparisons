  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for encouraging my 4y/o to push away another kid who keeps violently hugging her?\nJust had a fight with my SO because of what I told our daughter about \"legit violence\". Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The husband disagrees, saying it's better to tell a teacher instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is 4, same age, and the parents think he's being too rough. The daughter has already told teachers, but it's not helping because the teachers can't catch it. The user argues that the kid is using force and the daughter is allowed to defend herself. But the husband is against any form of violence, even if it's to stop someone else.\n\nNow, from a parent's perspective, teaching a child to use force might be seen as promoting aggression. But on the other hand, teaching boundaries and self-defense is important. However, the daughter is very young, 4 years old. Can she really understand the difference between appropriate and necessary force at that age? Maybe not. Young kids can escalate situations if they're told to push back, especially if they're scared or confused.\n\nAlso, the scenario involves another child who might have behavioral issues. The parents mention the boy's parents are overbearing, which might contribute to his behavior. If the daughter is told to push him back, it could lead to physical altercations between the kids, which might be more dangerous than just dealing with the hugs. The husband's approach is to rely on adults, which is the standard advice for young children. Teachers and caregivers are supposed to handle such situations, even if they're not catching it now. Maybe the parents should work with the daycare more effectively, not just rely on the child to handle it herself.\n\nAnother angle: the daughter is old enough to communicate her discomfort. Maybe the user could reinforce verbal communication, like saying \"no\" louder or moving away, instead of physical resistance. Since the daughter is already trying to tell the other kid to stop but he doesn't listen, maybe the problem is that she's not confident in asserting herself. Teaching her to seek help from adults might be more effective and safer. \n\nAlso, promoting violence, even as defense, at such a young age could have long-term effects on how the child views conflict. It's a delicate balance between teaching self-defense and promoting aggression. The key here is that the child is very young, and the situation is between two children without adult supervision. The parents need to protect their child without instilling fear or aggression.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user might be in the wrong because teaching a 4-year-old to use force might escalate the situation, and there are safer ways to handle it, like seeking help from adults. The husband's approach of focusing on non-violent solutions might be better, even if it's not perfect. The user's solution could lead to more harm, especially if the other kid retaliates. The parents should work with the daycare to address the issue properly instead of relying on the child to handle it.\n"
