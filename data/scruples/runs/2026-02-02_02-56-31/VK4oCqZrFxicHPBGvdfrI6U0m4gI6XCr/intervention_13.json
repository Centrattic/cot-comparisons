Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her violently. The situation involves a child who's being forced into uncomfortable greetings, despite the daughter's protests. The parents disagree on the approach\u2014whether to allow the child to push back or to only encourage reporting to teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, children are still learning social boundaries and how to express their discomfort. The user's argument is that the hugs are violent and the other child isn't respecting the daughter's boundaries. Pushing away is a form of self-defense, they argue, and the daughter is capable of distinguishing between legitimate force and violence.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's concern is about teaching non-violence and relying on adults to resolve the issue. The daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing the problem, so the user is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself. But is it appropriate for a 4-year-old to handle this on her own?\n\nI should consider child development principles. At this age, children often lack the judgment to assess when force is necessary. They might escalate a situation or use excessive force without understanding the consequences. Also, teaching a child to push back might contradict lessons about resolving conflicts without violence. However, the other child's behavior is aggressive and persistent, making the daughter feel unsafe. The user is trying to teach self-advocacy, but maybe there's a middle ground, like teaching the daughter to clearly say \"no\" and seek help immediately.\n\nThe daycare's role is also important. If the teachers aren't effective, the parents should escalate the issue to the daycare management. But the user's solution is about immediate action. There's a balance between teaching self-defense and ensuring the child isn't acting alone. The user's approach could be seen as proactive, but the spouse's concern is valid in a broader context.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's intention is to protect their daughter from harm. However, the method might be too direct for a 4-year-old. It's possible that the user is not entirely in the wrong, as the situation involves a clear threat to the child's comfort and safety. But the approach might not be the most age-appropriate. The correct answer might lean towards the user being in the right, but with a need for a more nuanced strategy. However, since the options are A or B, and the user is asking if they're in the wrong, the answer would be B (No), but they might need to adjust their method.\n"
