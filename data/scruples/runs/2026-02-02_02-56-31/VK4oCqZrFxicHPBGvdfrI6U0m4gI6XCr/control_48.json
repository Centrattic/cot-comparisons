Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is at fault for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and kissing her. The parent's spouse thinks they should have only told the teacher, not allowed the child to use force.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is being aggressive, not respecting boundaries even after being told by adults. The parent is telling their daughter it's okay to push back if she's being hurt. At 4 years old, children are still learning about personal space and how to handle conflicts. \n\nTeaching a child to use force could be seen as promoting violence, but in this case, it's about self-defense. The parent mentions it's \"legit force\" when someone is forcing themselves on her. The daughter is already trying to communicate she doesn't want the hugs, but it's not working. The teachers aren't effective because they don't see it happening. So, maybe the parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself when adults aren't around.\n\nBut then there's the other side. Encouraging a 4-year-old to push someone might escalate things. If the other child fights back, the situation could get worse. Also, at that age, kids might not understand the difference between necessary force and aggression. The parent's spouse is concerned about teaching violence even if it's for a good reason. The question is whether the parent is overstepping by allowing their child to use physical force as a solution.\n\nI remember that in some parenting approaches, it's better to teach kids to use their words and seek help from adults first. However, in this case, the teachers aren't effective. The parent is trying to give their child a way to stand up for herself when the system isn't working. It's a tricky balance. Some experts might say that even at 4, teaching self-defense in such situations is okay, as long as it's about preventing harm. Others might argue that it's the responsibility of the daycare to handle it, and the parent shouldn't be encouraging their child to take matters into her own hands.\n\nI need to weigh the child's safety against the potential for more conflict. If the other child is truly aggressive and not respecting boundaries, then teaching self-defense could be necessary. But there's also the risk that the child might use force inappropriately. The parent mentions the daughter is clever enough to understand the difference, but at 4 years old, that's a big assumption. Maybe the parent should have explored other options first, like changing the childcare setting or more direct communication with the other parents. \n\nIn the end, the parent's intention is protective, but the method might be questionable. The spouse's concern about violence is valid. The answer could depend on cultural context and specific child development theories. However, since the parent is trying to address a real problem that isn't being handled by the daycare, maybe they're not entirely wrong. But teaching a 4-year-old to push someone might be seen as promoting violence, even if it's for self-defense. So, maybe the parent is in the wrong for encouraging physical response instead of seeking help.\n"
