Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The main points here are about a child being uncomfortable with another's physical contact and the parent advising them to use force to stop it. \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from different angles. The other kid is being aggressive and not respecting boundaries, even after being told by adults. The parents are concerned about their daughter's safety and comfort. The user's approach is to teach the daughter to defend herself with physical force if necessary, while the SO thinks it's better to rely on adults.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that sometimes telling and reporting isn't enough, especially if the child is too young to communicate effectively. They argue that the daughter is old enough to understand when force is appropriate. The SO disagrees, emphasizing non-violence.\n\nIn terms of child development, 4-year-olds are still learning about personal space and boundaries. It's possible that physical intervention could escalate the situation, leading to more conflict. However, the child is already in a situation where the other child isn't respecting her no, which is a serious issue.\n\nI should also consider the advice given by the user: push away, push back if needed, and then report. This seems to balance immediate self-defense with reporting to adults. But some might argue that teaching a child to use violence could normalize it, even in self-defense scenarios. Others might see it as necessary for her safety.\n\nThe key here is whether teaching a child to use physical force is appropriate. Different parenting styles might lead to different answers. The user is trying to protect their child's autonomy and safety, while the SO is concerned about promoting non-violence.\n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. The user's approach is about immediate self-protection, which can be justified in cases of unwanted physical contact. However, there's a risk of encouraging aggression. But given the scenario where the other child isn't responding to verbal cues or adults, the user's advice might be seen as necessary. So, I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but it's a close call.\n"
