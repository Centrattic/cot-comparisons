Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is at fault for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard. The kid in question is also 4, but his hugs are described as violent, long, and forceful, even after the teacher intervenes. The parent feels it's okay to use force to stop someone who's being violent and not respecting their wishes. The spouse disagrees, thinks they should only tell the teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to express their feelings. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense or self-advocacy. But using physical force might be seen as teaching aggression. However, the situation isn't a typical hug; it's more like forced hugging and kissing that the child doesn't want and can't stop through words.\n\nThe parent argues it's about stopping unwelcome physical contact. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence. But the parent emphasizes that it's a response to violence, not just any conflict. The key here is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old. At that age, pushing someone could escalate physical altercations, especially since the other kid might react. Also, the daycare teachers aren't handling it well, so the parent wants to empower the child to protect herself.\n\nHowever, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force as a solution might not be the best approach. Their understanding of force and consequences isn't fully developed. They might not know how hard to push or could misinterpret the situation. Also, the daycare might have policies against children using physical force, even in self-defense. The spouse's concern about non-violent resolution makes sense, but the parent is trying to protect their child from harm.\n\nAnother angle: the child has already tried telling the teacher, but it's not working. The parent might feel that not teaching self-defense would leave their daughter vulnerable. But the alternative is to keep telling adults, which hasn't worked so far. Maybe the parent should also focus on improving communication with the daycare or involving higher authorities instead of teaching the child to push back. However, the parent's intention is to protect, which is understandable.\n\nIn terms of child development, encouraging a 4-year-old to use force might not be the best strategy. They might not fully grasp the implications, and it could lead to more aggressive behavior. The parent might be right in the immediate sense but wrong in the long-term approach. The spouse's advice to rely on adults is more about teaching non-violent conflict resolution, which is important for social skills.\n\nSo, the parent's advice is situational. They are responding to a specific problem of unwanted physical contact, but teaching a child to use physical force could have unintended consequences. The right approach might be a balance: teaching the child to express discomfort clearly, use words, and seek help, while also considering self-defense if absolutely necessary. However, given the child's age and the daycare's failure to address the issue, the parent might feel justified. But overall, the consensus might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because promoting physical solutions at that age isn't ideal. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a gray area. The answer could be B, the parent isn't in the wrong, because the situation is about self-protection against unwelcome violence, and the parent is trying to teach appropriate force. But the spouse's point about non-violence is also valid. Hmm.\n"
