Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too roughly. The spouse is upset because they think the kid wasn't using violence, just hugging too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is being forceful and doesn't stop even when told. The parents of that child are described as helicopter parents, which might mean they're overprotective and maybe not addressing the child's behavior properly. The daycare teachers aren't effective in stopping the behavior either.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that if someone is using force and not respecting the child's boundaries, it's okay to push back as self-defense. They emphasize that the child is being taught to use \"legit violence,\" not to start fights. The spouse argues that the child should only tell the teachers and avoid using any violence.\n\nI should think about child safety and boundaries. At 4 years old, a child is still learning about personal space and how to communicate their discomfort. If another child is being aggressive and not respecting \"no,\" then teaching the child to set boundaries is important. However, physical retaliation could escalate the situation or lead to the child being labeled as aggressive. Daycare policies usually encourage non-violent conflict resolution, so maybe the spouse is right in suggesting talking to teachers instead.\n\nBut there's a line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence. If the other child is truly violating her personal space and safety, then teaching her to protect herself is a valid approach. The key here is the context of the force used. The user isn't teaching random violence, just in situations where the other child is being violent or non-consensual.\n\nI need to balance between safety and the daycare's rules. The child is old enough to understand basic self-defense concepts, like pushing away if someone is too forceful. The user's approach is about teaching her to protect herself when verbal cues fail and adults aren't available. The spouse's concern is about avoiding violence, but in cases of actual physical aggression, self-defense is necessary.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether pushing away is considered an appropriate response in the daycare's context. If the daycare has specific rules against any form of physical intervention, then the user might be in the wrong. However, if the situation is genuinely threatening the child's well-being, teaching her to defend herself is justified. The user's approach is about respecting boundaries and safety, which is crucial for a child's development.\n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong because they're teaching their child to protect herself in a situation where others aren't respecting her boundaries and adults aren't intervening effectively.\n"
