Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push another kid who's hugging her too hard. The kid in question is also 4 and his parents are described as helicopter parents. The daughter has already told the teachers, but the behavior continues. The author told the daughter it's okay to push back if the other child won't stop, and even to push back again if the other kid retaliates. The spouse says that using violence is wrong and that telling the teachers is better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Four years old is very young. At that age, a child's understanding of boundaries and consequences might not be fully developed. The author is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself, which is a valid concern. However, teaching a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, might not be appropriate in this context. \n\nThe other child's behavior, while uncomfortable, might be developmentally typical for a 4-year-old. Kids at that age don't always understand personal space and might not mean to be violent. The author's approach assumes the child is being violent, but maybe it's more about over-enthusiastic hugs. There's a difference between aggressive behavior and just being too affectionate. \n\nAlso, the spouse's perspective is important. They argue that non-violent solutions, like telling the teachers, are better. The author mentions that the teachers haven't been effective so far. But perhaps there are other steps that could be taken, like talking to the other child's parents or the daycare's director. \n\nThere's a risk in teaching a young child to use physical force. It could escalate situations, as the daughter herself was concerned. If the other child does push back, the situation might become more confrontational. Moreover, modeling problem-solving through words and reporting to adults is a key part of social learning. \n\nHowever, the author does emphasize that the force used is only in response to violence and to protect the daughter. The line between self-defense and retaliation is thin, especially for a young child. The author might be trying to empower the daughter to stand up for herself, but there's a balance between empowerment and encouraging aggression.\n\nIn terms of child development, promoting communication and non-violent conflict resolution is usually recommended. The daughter is already talking to the teachers, but maybe the daycare needs more specific intervention, like teaching the other child about personal space or redirecting the hugging behavior. \n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because introducing physical responses can lead to a cycle where the child feels more aggression is acceptable. It's important to consider the child's emotional state too\u2014feeling scared or confused if they push back and the other child responds negatively.\n\nSo, on one hand, the author is trying to protect their child from discomfort and potential harm. On the other hand, teaching self-defense through physical means at such a young age might not be the best approach, especially when the situation might not involve actual violence but just overly affectionate behavior. The daycare's role is also a factor here; perhaps more structured intervention is needed rather than individual solutions.\n"
