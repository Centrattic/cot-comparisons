Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not working. The parent is saying it's okay to use force to protect herself, while the spouse thinks she should rely on telling adults instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young. Their understanding of boundaries and how to handle conflicts is developing. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself, which is a valid concern, especially if the other child isn't respecting her no. But there's a risk in encouraging physical retaliation. Even if it's defensive, at that age, children might not fully grasp the difference between appropriate self-defense and starting a fight. The husband's concern is that using violence can escalate the situation, leading to more harm. \n\nAlso, the daycare's role is important. The parent mentioned that the teachers aren't seeing the incidents, so maybe there's a need for better supervision. But the daughter has already reported it, so maybe the daycare isn't addressing it properly. The parent's advice could be a way to empower the child to take immediate action when adults aren't around. However, teaching a young child to push someone back might not be the best approach. They might not know the limits, leading to more conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the child's emotional development. The daughter is showing she can recognize when she's uncomfortable, which is good. But teaching her to use physical force might conflict with the family's usual stance against violence. The parent mentions they are strict about not using violence, but this is an exception. The spouse might feel that making an exception could confuse the child. \n\nThere's also the aspect of teaching problem-solving. Maybe alternatives like using words more effectively, moving away, or seeking help from a specific trusted adult could be better strategies. The parent's advice includes running away and telling an adult, which is good, but the physical push might not be necessary. \n\nLegal and educational guidelines might suggest that even for young children, it's safer to rely on adults to mediate conflicts rather than allowing children to use physical force. There's a risk that the child being pushed might retaliate, leading to more harm. So the parent's intention is protective, but the method could have unintended consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, advising a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best approach. The spouse's concern about non-violent solutions and relying on adults to resolve the issue is valid. There's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and ensuring the child doesn't engage in behaviors that could escalate conflicts or contradict their broader values against violence. So the parent might be in the wrong here.\n"
