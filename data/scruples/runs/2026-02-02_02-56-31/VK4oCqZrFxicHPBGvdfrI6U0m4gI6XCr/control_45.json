Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away a classmate who's hugging/kissing her too hard and not stopping even when she yells.\n\nFirst, the kid at daycare is being overly physical in a way that's uncomfortable. The daughter already told the teachers but it's not stopping. The parent advises her to push him away if he won't stop, and even to push back or run away if he reacts violently. The spouse thinks it's better to rely on teachers and avoid violence.\n\nHmm, so for a 4-year-old, teaching to use physical force might be a gray area. On one hand, the child's instinct is to protect themselves from uncomfortable situations. The parent is empowering the child to set boundaries, but maybe the spouse is concerned about the child using violence, even if it's defensive. But the parent clarifies they didn't encourage beating up, just \"legit force.\" The situation involves another child not respecting her no, which could be a form of bullying or inappropriate behavior. \n\nThe parent's approach emphasizes self-defense and immediate action, which could be necessary if adults aren't able to intervene effectively. However, 4-year-olds might not fully understand how to apply force appropriately. They might escalate things or push too hard, leading to another conflict. Also, the daycare's role is to handle such situations, so maybe the parent should have focused more on ensuring the teachers are better aware and can monitor the interactions more closely. \n\nBut the daughter is already aware of the problem and has tried telling the teachers. The parent's advice might be a realistic way to help her protect herself in the moment. The spouse's concern is valid because teaching a child to use violence, even for self-defense, can be risky and might not be the best long-term lesson. However, in cases where a child is being physically forced in a way that's harmful, it's important to teach them to defend themselves. \n\nSo the answer depends on the balance between immediate safety and the broader lesson about non-violence. The parent didn't encourage general violence but specific, defensive actions. The spouse's approach is more about trusting the system (teachers) to handle it, which is also valid. The child is old enough to understand boundaries, but the execution of the advice might be too direct. Maybe a middle ground would be better, teaching how to use words more effectively and ensure the daycare is more proactive. However, the parent's intention was to protect their daughter, which is a key factor. \n\nI think the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but the advice might be too aggressive for a 4-year-old. The correct response is B (No), but with the caveat that they should also work on improving communication with the daycare staff to address the root cause.\n"
