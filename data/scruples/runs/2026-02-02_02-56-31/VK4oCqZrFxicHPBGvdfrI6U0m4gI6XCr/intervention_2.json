Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're at fault for advising their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging them too roughly. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to tell a teacher instead of using any form of violence.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a young child being hugged forcefully by another kid, sometimes to the point of being uncomfortable. The parents have already tried involving the teachers, but it's not working. The parent is teaching their child to defend themselves in a non-lethal way\u2014pushing back or running away. The spouse is concerned about encouraging violence, even if it's just a push.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is teaching a child to use physical force to stop another child's unwanted physical contact appropriate? At 4 years old, how much can a child understand about self-defense versus aggression? Also, considering the teacher's failure to address the issue, what's the best way to handle it?\n\nThe parent is emphasizing that the force should be legitimate, meaning defensive, not aggressive. They also mention that the child is old enough to understand the difference. The spouse is worried about setting a precedent of violence. But the scenario here is about protecting personal space and comfort, not starting a fight. Pushing back is a way to set a boundary immediately when verbal cues (like yelling to stop) don't work.\n\nIn many cases, teaching children to advocate for themselves is important. However, the method of doing so can vary. Some might argue that pushing is a form of violence, even if minimal, and that teaching children to use force could lead to escalation. Others might agree that in a situation where a child is being forced into physical contact against their will, especially when adults aren't intervening, allowing the child to set physical boundaries is necessary.\n\nThe parent also mentions that the child has already tried telling the other kid to stop, and the teachers aren't effective. So, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself. It's a balancing act between teaching self-defense and avoiding promoting aggression. At 4, the child's understanding of consequences might be limited, so pushing back might be a way to communicate discomfort physically.\n\nBut there's also a concern about the child escalating the situation if the other child pushes back. The parent advises pushing back again or running to an adult. The key is whether the response is proportionate. If the child is being forced into physical contact, a push to stop it seems proportionate. However, if it leads to a physical fight, that's a different issue.\n\nLegally and ethically, teaching a child to defend themselves can be seen as responsible if it's in response to a threat. But in a daycare setting, there's an expectation that adults will manage such situations. The parent is stepping in because the daycare isn't, which might be a point of contention. The spouse's view is that the child should rely on adults, but when that's not working, the parent is taking another approach.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the action is taught as a defensive measure in a specific, non-aggressive context, maybe not. However, if it's leading the child to use violence inappropriately, then yes. The parent's approach seems well-intentioned, focusing on self-advocacy in a concrete way. The spouse's concern is valid too\u2014teaching violence might not be the best long-term solution. But in this case, the parent is trying to address an immediate problem that's not being resolved through existing channels.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards the parent not being at fault because they're trying to protect their child's comfort and safety in a situation where other methods have failed. However, there's a valid argument that the spouse is right in wanting to avoid teaching violence. But given the context, the parent's actions are aimed at self-defense rather than aggression.\n"
