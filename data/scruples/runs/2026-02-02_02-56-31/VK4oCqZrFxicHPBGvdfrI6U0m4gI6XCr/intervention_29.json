Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to tell the teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the child being uncomfortable with the other kid's behavior. The daughter has already reported it to teachers, but they can't see it happen and the other kid doesn't stop. So the parents are trying to teach their daughter how to handle it.\n\nThe parent's advice is about using self-defense in a situation where she's being forced into unwanted physical contact. The concern is that the other child isn't respecting her personal space, which is a form of violence or at least a form of aggression for a 4-year-old. The parent is teaching her to protect herself, which is a reasonable approach for self-defense. However, the spouse thinks it's better to avoid any violence and just rely on adults.\n\nBut at 4 years old, the child's ability to seek help might be limited. If the teachers aren't catching it, maybe the child needs immediate strategies to stop the unwanted contact. Teaching her to push back is a way to assert her boundaries physically, which can be necessary in cases of non-consensual contact. However, there's a risk that this could escalate into a physical fight, which is why the spouse is worried.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is emphasizing that it's about legitimate force\u2014not random aggression, but a specific response to being forced into unwanted contact. The parent also mentions teaching the difference between legitimate self-defense and violence, which is important. The child is old enough to understand the concept of personal space and consent, so teaching her to protect herself in this context seems appropriate.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how to handle the situation with the daycare. Maybe the best approach is to continue working with the daycare to address the behavior more effectively, possibly involving the other child's parents or a counselor. However, since the daycare isn't successful, the parent is trying to equip their daughter with a tool to protect herself until the situation can be resolved.\n\nIn terms of child safety and consent education, teaching a child to say no and protect themselves physically when necessary is a valid strategy. However, some might argue that for a 4-year-old, the best approach is to seek help immediately rather than use physical means. But if the child is in a situation where she can't get help quickly, self-defense is a necessary skill.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent's advice seems reasonable given the circumstances. They are not teaching the child to use excessive force but to defend herself when someone is being violent towards her. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
