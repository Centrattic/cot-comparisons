Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's giving violent hugs and kisses. The parent's spouse thinks the parent is wrong to encourage using force, while the parent argues it's necessary self-defense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old might not fully understand boundaries yet, but the daughter is already aware enough to express discomfort. The other child's behavior is described as \"violent,\" which is concerning. The daycare teachers aren't effectively handling the situation, so the parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself.\n\nThe parent isn't promoting general violence; they're teaching specific self-defense in a situation where the child is being forced into physical contact. The advice includes pushing back only if necessary and then telling an adult, which adds a layer of responsibility. The spouse argues for non-violence, which is a valid perspective, but the parent is trying to address a real problem that isn't being resolved through adults.\n\nLegally and ethically, teaching a child to defend themselves when being physically assaulted, even at a young age, could be seen as appropriate. However, some might argue that at 4, kids should be taught to use words and seek help, not physical force. But given that the other child isn't stopping when told and the teachers aren't intervening effectively, the parent's approach might be a practical solution.\n\nThere's a balance between teaching self-defense and encouraging non-aggression. The parent emphasizes using force only when necessary and then reporting it, which seems measured. The key is whether the parent's advice is reasonable for the situation. Since the child is in a vulnerable position and the other child's behavior is aggressive, the parent's advice might be justified as a way to empower the child to protect herself.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to address a real issue with the tools available. The answer is B.\n"
