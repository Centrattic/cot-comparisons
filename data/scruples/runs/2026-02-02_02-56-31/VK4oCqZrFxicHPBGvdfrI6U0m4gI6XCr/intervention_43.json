Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The parent is asking if they're at fault for teaching their 4-year-old to push away a kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The spouse disagrees and thinks the child should just tell the teachers. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. Four years old is pretty young, and the child is already aware that the other kid isn't stopping even when she yells. The teachers aren't catching it in the act, so maybe there's a gap in supervision or how the teachers are handling it. \n\nThe parent is advising their daughter to use force if necessary, which is a form of self-defense. But the spouse is concerned that teaching a child to respond with violence, even if it's just pushing, could set a bad precedent. They might be worried about the child learning that violence is an acceptable response, even in self-defense.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent argues that it's about using \"legit force\" when someone is being violent. The daughter is old enough to understand the difference, maybe. The key here is the balance between teaching self-defense and teaching non-violence. \n\nI should also consider typical parenting strategies. Many experts advocate for teaching children to stand up for themselves in a non-violent way, like using their voice, seeking help, or moving away. But in cases where a child is being physically forced, some might argue that it's reasonable to have self-defense skills, even at a young age.\n\nHowever, the child is 4, so the advice needs to be age-appropriate. Pushing back might escalate the situation. Maybe the parent's approach is too direct. The spouse's point about telling an adult is valid, but if the teachers aren't responding, that's a problem. \n\nAnother angle: the parent is trying to protect their child from discomfort and possible harm. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence. Both have valid points. But the parent's advice might be too aggressive for a 4-year-old, especially since the child is worried the other kid might retaliate. Teaching the child to run away and tell an adult might be safer. \n\nSo, the parent might be in the wrong because they're encouraging a violent response at a very young age, which could lead to more aggression. The spouse's approach emphasizes non-violence and seeking help, which is generally safer for kids. The parent could have focused more on reinforcing the child to assert herself without hitting, or to report it again, maybe with a specific strategy. \n\nBut then again, the situation is about the other child being violent. It's a tricky balance. However, in most child development advice, teaching young children to use physical force as a first response isn't recommended. They're more likely to escalate things. So the parent might have overstepped by advising to push back, even if it's for self-defense. The correct answer would be that the parent is at fault (A).\n"
