Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push another kid who's giving her unwanted, forceful hugs and kisses. The main issue is whether it's appropriate to encourage a child to use physical force to defend herself in this situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. Four years old is pretty young, and their understanding of right and wrong is still developing. The parent is trying to protect their daughter from discomfort and potential harm, which is understandable. The other kid's behavior is aggressive and not respecting boundaries, which the daycare teachers haven't managed well. The parent wants their daughter to defend herself without escalating it into something worse. \n\nOn the other hand, the spouse is concerned about teaching the child to use violence. There's a valid point here because encouraging physical retaliation can lead to cycles of aggression and might not teach appropriate conflict resolution skills. However, the parent is distinguishing between \"legit force\" for self-defense and actual violence. The daughter was advised to push back only if the other kid is being violent and not to use excessive force. Also, the parent emphasized following up by telling an adult, which combines immediate self-defense with reporting the issue.\n\nAnother angle is the child's emotional well-being. The daughter is already upset and has tried telling the teachers, who aren't effective. The parent's advice gives her a sense of agency and safety. But there's a risk that the daughter might misinterpret the permission to push as an excuse to be aggressive herself. However, the parent is clear that it's only in cases of forceful, unwanted contact.\n\nLegal and ethical perspectives might weigh in here. In many places, self-defense is justified, even for a child, if they're protecting themselves from harm. The parent is teaching their child to recognize and respond to inappropriate physical contact, which is a safety skill. However, daycare policies and social norms might suggest that children should resolve conflicts with words and seeking adult help, not physical means.\n\nThe spouse's concern is about setting a precedent. If the daughter starts pushing others, even in self-defense, it could lead to disciplinary actions or a reputation for aggression. The daycare might see it as a problem and not address the root issue with the other child's behavior. It's a balancing act between protecting the daughter and adhering to social norms and daycare rules.\n\nI should also consider the child's age in terms of their ability to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate physical contact. The parent is giving clear instructions, but a 4-year-old might not always make the right judgment in the moment. The daughter did express concern that the other kid might retaliate, which the parent addressed by suggesting she push back or run and tell an adult. That shows the parent is preparing her for possible outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid concerns on both sides, the parent's intention is to protect their child and teach her to respect her own boundaries. The approach includes both self-defense and reporting, which is a balanced method. The spouse's worry about violence is understandable, but the parent is not encouraging unprovoked aggression. The key is the context of defending against unwanted, forceful contact. So, the parent is likely not in the wrong here.\n"
