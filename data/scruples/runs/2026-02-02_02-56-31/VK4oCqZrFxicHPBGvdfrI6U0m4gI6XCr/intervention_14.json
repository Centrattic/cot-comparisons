Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and even kissing her forcefully. The situation involves a child who's not respecting boundaries, and the parents are split on how to handle it.\n\nFirst, the daughter has already reported this to the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parents want to teach her to defend herself. The user argues that it's about using \"legit violence\" to push back when someone is being violent. The SO disagrees, thinking it's better to rely on teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nSo, is the user right to encourage physical resistance? At 4 years old, a child might not fully understand the consequences of using force. Even if it's defensive, teaching a child to push back could escalate the situation. The other kid might get upset and push back harder, leading to a physical confrontation. Daycare staff are supposed to manage these interactions, but they aren't always present. However, the user's approach is about immediate self-defense, which can be seen as necessary when adults aren't around.\n\nOn the other hand, the SO's concern is valid. Encouraging violence, even in self-defense, might not be the best lesson for a young child. It could normalize physical responses to conflict, which might not be ideal in other situations. Also, the daycare has a responsibility to address this behavior, and maybe more steps should be taken with the teachers or parents of the other child.\n\nBut the key point here is that the daughter is being physically uncomfortable and the other child isn't respecting her boundaries. The user is trying to empower her to protect herself when adults aren't around. There's a balance between teaching assertiveness and avoiding violence. Maybe there's a middle ground, like teaching the child to use her voice more effectively, or to seek help immediately if the other child doesn't stop. However, in the absence of immediate adult help, the user's approach is about immediate safety.\n\nI think the user isn't entirely wrong. They're addressing a real issue of bodily autonomy and teaching the child to protect herself. However, the method might not be the best. Maybe instead of pushing, the child could be taught to say \"no\" firmly, step back, and run to get an adult. The user's answer involves pushing back, which could be seen as aggressive, but it's in response to an aggressive act. So it's a bit of a grey area. The user's intention is protective, but the method could be questioned. It's possible that the user isn't in the wrong, but maybe there's a better way to handle it. So leaning towards answer B (not in the wrong), but with some reservations.\n"
