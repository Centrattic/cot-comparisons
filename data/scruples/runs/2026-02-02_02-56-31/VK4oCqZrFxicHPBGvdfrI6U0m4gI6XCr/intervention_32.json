Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who is hugging and kissing her inappropriately. The parent's partner is upset because they think it's better to just tell a teacher instead of using any form of physical resistance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. The daughter is 4 years old, which is very young. At this age, children might not fully understand how to handle situations where they feel uncomfortable, especially if the other child is being forceful. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to set boundaries, which is important for developing self-advocacy skills. However, the method they're suggesting is physical resistance. \n\nThe main issue here is whether teaching a young child to use physical force is appropriate. On one hand, the parent wants their daughter to feel empowered to defend herself when someone is making her uncomfortable. On the other hand, the partner argues that teaching non-violent solutions is better, as using force could escalate the situation or lead to more conflict. \n\nI should also think about the daycare's role. The user mentioned that the teachers haven't been effective in stopping the behavior, so maybe there's a need to revisit the situation with the daycare staff. However, the parent is concerned that the daughter is already reporting the issue, and the daycare isn't acting effectively. \n\nAnother angle is the child's understanding of violence. The parent mentions the difference between \"legit violence\" and using force to protect oneself. At 4 years old, a child might not grasp the nuances of self-defense versus aggression. Teaching her to push back might lead to her using that approach in other contexts where it's not appropriate. \n\nAlso, the parent is emphasizing that the daughter should tell an adult if the situation escalates, which is a good point. But the initial advice is to push away, which could be seen as promoting physical confrontation. The partner's concern is valid because even if it's in self-defense, it's still physical contact that could be viewed as aggressive in a daycare setting. \n\nIn terms of child development, encouraging a young child to use physical force might not be the best approach. It's generally advised to teach children to use words, seek help, and remove themselves from situations. However, in cases where a child is being physically forced into unwanted contact, allowing them to push away could prevent harm. \n\nThe key here is balancing safety with appropriate conflict resolution. The parent's approach might be well-intentioned but could lead to the child using more aggressive tactics. The partner's approach focuses on non-violence but might leave the child feeling vulnerable if the daycare isn't handling it properly. \n\nI should also consider if there are other measures they can take, like discussing the issue with the daycare again, involving the other child's parents, or providing the daughter with strategies to avoid the situation, like walking away or using assertive language. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, the method of teaching physical resistance might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old. There's a risk of the child using force inappropriately or escalating conflicts. The partner's concern about non-violent solutions is valid, and perhaps a combination of both approaches\u2014teaching boundaries and seeking adult help\u2014would be more effective.\n"
