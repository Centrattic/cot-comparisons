Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her violently. The parent's partner is upset, saying it's better to tell teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is experiencing unwanted, forceful physical contact from another kid. The parent is teaching her to defend herself when the other child doesn't stop despite being told. The parent argues that it's legitimate to push back if the other kid is being violent. The partner thinks using any violence is wrong.\n\nIn child development, 4-year-olds are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent's approach is about self-defense in a situation where the child is being physically forced. However, teaching a child to use physical force could have consequences. Maybe the child might escalate the situation or might not understand the appropriate amount of force. Also, the daycare's role is to manage such interactions, so relying on the child to handle it might not be the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when the system (teachers not noticing) isn't working. The parent isn't encouraging aggression but rather teaching self-protection in a specific context of harm.\n\nBut the partner's concern is valid too. Encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense, might be seen as a bad lesson. It could lead to the child using force in other situations inappropriately. Also, the daycare's responsibility is to handle such issues, so maybe the parent should focus on working with the daycare more effectively.\n\nHowever, the parent is not teaching the child to initiate violence but to respond to an immediate threat. The line between self-defense and violence is thin here. The key is whether the parent's advice is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nIn many cases, experts recommend teaching children to say no, seek help, and not use physical force. But if the child is in immediate danger and can't get help, self-defense might be necessary. The parent is balancing these two aspects.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on the cultural or societal norms, but generally, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone away might be seen as crossing into encouraging violence, even if the intent is self-defense. The partner's perspective is that non-violent conflict resolution is better, even if it's challenging. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for promoting physical response over communication and seeking adult help.\n"
