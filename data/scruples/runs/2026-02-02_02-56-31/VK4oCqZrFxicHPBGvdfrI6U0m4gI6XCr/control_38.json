Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too violently. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the daughter's classmate is hugging her forcefully and even kissing her, sometimes not stopping when she yells. The daughter already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if necessary, and if the other kid retaliates, to push back more or run and tell an adult. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to report it to teachers and avoid violence.\n\nI need to consider child development and appropriate conflict resolution for a 4-year-old. At that age, kids are still learning how to express their boundaries and emotions. Teaching self-defense or using force might be appropriate if there's a threat, but the child is very young. However, the other kid's behavior is unwanted and possibly abusive. The parent is trying to empower the daughter to protect herself when others aren't helping.\n\nOn the other hand, encouraging physical retaliation could escalate the situation. The parent's spouse is right that non-violent solutions are usually better for young children. But the daughter is already being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's causing her distress. The parent's advice is specific to situations where the child is harmed and needs to defend herself, which might be considered justified in a self-defense context.\n\nI should also consider if the parent is teaching the daughter that violence is acceptable. The parent clarifies they're not teaching general violence, but only in cases of legitimate harm. The daughter is also told to report the incident to an adult afterward. So maybe the parent's approach is balanced, but the spouse is concerned about the message it sends about conflict resolution.\n\nAnother angle: the daycare's responsibility. The teachers aren't acting adequately, so the parent is trying to fill that gap. But maybe the parent should have escalated the issue further with the daycare or contacted the other child's parents if possible. However, the daughter's safety is the priority here.\n\nIn terms of parenting advice, most sources would suggest teaching children to use their words first, seek help from adults, and avoid physical confrontation. However, in cases where a child is being physically harmed and no adults are available, teaching self-defense in a limited way might be justified. The key is ensuring the child understands that it's for self-protection and not aggression.\n\nSo the parent is trying to help their child feel safe and empowered. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence, which is a valid point. However, the parent's advice is specific to a situation where the child is being harmed and not helped by others. It's a gray area, but maybe the parent is not entirely wrong. They might need to also reinforce reporting the issue to adults and using words first, but advising self-defense in that context could be seen as necessary. So the answer might be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
