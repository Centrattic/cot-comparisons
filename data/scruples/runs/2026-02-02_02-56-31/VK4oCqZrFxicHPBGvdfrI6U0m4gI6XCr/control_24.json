Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push another kid who's hugging or kissing her too forcefully. The daughter already tried telling the teachers, but it didn't help. The parent's partner thinks she shouldn't encourage any violence, even in self-defense.\n\nFirst, at 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent is addressing a situation where another child is being physically aggressive, not just playful. The daughter is clearly uncomfortable sometimes, even after asking the other kid to stop. The parent's advice is about using force to protect herself when the other child isn't respecting her boundaries and the adults aren't intervening effectively.\n\nBut there's a line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence. The parent says they're teaching her to push back if she's being hurt and the other kid might retaliate. However, with a 4-year-old, their ability to assess situations and respond appropriately is limited. Teaching a child to use physical force could lead to escalation or misunderstandings. At that age, the best approach is usually to teach non-violent responses first, like saying no, walking away, or immediately telling a trusted adult. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the daughter already reported the issue to teachers, but the problem persists. Maybe the next step should be involving the daycare more formally or talking to the other child's parents. The partner's concern is valid because encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense, might not be age-appropriate. The daycare's role is to manage such interactions, so relying on the child to handle it could be risky. \n\nThe parent's intention is protective, but the method might not be suitable for a child's developmental stage. The key here is balancing the child's need to feel safe with teaching appropriate conflict resolution. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because the solution given isn't the most effective for a 4-year-old and could lead to more problems.\n"
