Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The parent is encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly and sometimes kissing her without consent. The daughter already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent thinks it's okay to use \"legit force\" in this case, while the spouse thinks she should rely on teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old is very young, and their understanding of appropriate behavior is still developing. The other kid's actions\u2014forceful hugs and kisses\u2014could be considered non-consensual physical contact. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself in a situation where she's not being heard by the adults or the other child. However, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might escalate the situation, especially if the other child is also that age. At that age, kids don't handle conflict well, and pushing could lead to more harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent argues that it's about using necessary force to stop someone else from being violent or non-consensual. The daughter is clearly upset, and the teachers aren't effective. The parent's advice is specific to this scenario, not general violence. But does teaching a 4-year-old to push back set a bad precedent? It might, because at that age, it's hard for them to discern when force is appropriate. Also, the other child's behavior might need to be addressed by the daycare more thoroughly, maybe with parent involvement. The spouse's concern is valid because encouraging any form of violence, even if justified, could lead to the daughter thinking it's okay to use force in other situations.\n\nAdditionally, the daycare's role is to manage such interactions. The parent's approach could be seen as bypassing the system that's supposed to handle these issues. However, if the daycare isn't responding adequately, the parent is trying to protect their child. It's a tricky balance. Legally and ethically, teaching a child to defend themselves can be a point of debate. Some might say it's necessary for self-protection, while others think it's better to rely on adults to intervene. \n\nConsidering all factors, the parent might not be entirely wrong, but there might be better ways to handle it. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The spouse's stance is about non-violence, which is a common parenting approach. The parent's advice is specific and situational, aiming to protect their daughter. However, the potential for escalation and the child's age make it a gray area. I think the parent isn't in the wrong because they are trying to protect their child in a situation where other measures haven't worked. But there's a valid argument the other way. However, since the parent is being specific and not encouraging general violence, it's possible the answer is B.\n"
