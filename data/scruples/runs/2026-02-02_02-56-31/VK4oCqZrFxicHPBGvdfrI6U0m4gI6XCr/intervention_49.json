Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The situation involves a child who's being overly affectionate in a way that's making the daughter uncomfortable, even after she objects. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push him away if he doesn't stop, and the spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to just tell a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, kids are still learning about personal boundaries and how to handle social situations. The other child's behavior is persistent and not stopping when told, which the teachers aren't catching. The parent is teaching their daughter self-defense in a way that's necessary to protect herself from unwanted contact. But is teaching a 4-year-old to push back appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the parent is trying to empower the child to set boundaries and protect herself when the system (teachers) isn't working. The parent emphasizes using \"legit force,\" not violence. Pushing away could be seen as a reasonable response to stop immediate harm. They also advise running away and telling an adult, which adds layers of safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse argues that using any form of violence, even in self-defense, is not the right approach. At 4, a child might not understand how to measure their response or could escalate the situation. There's also a concern about the message being sent\u2014maybe the child should not take matters into her own hands even if she's being uncomfortable.\n\nI should also consider developmental psychology. At this age, children often lack the impulse control to de-escalate a situation. Teaching a child to push might lead to more physical altercations. However, the parent's approach is about immediate self-protection, which is a valid concern. The key is whether the parent is fostering appropriate self-advocacy or encouraging aggression.\n\nAnother angle is the role of authority figures. The teachers aren't responding adequately, so the parent is stepping in. But maybe the parent should have tried other methods first, like consulting the teachers directly, rather than teaching the child to handle it physically.\n\nAlso, the other child's behavior might need intervention from the daycare staff or parents. The parent here is trying to protect their daughter, which is natural. However, in a daycare setting, there are policies in place about how to handle such situations. The parent's advice might conflict with what the daycare expects from the children (like not using physical force regardless of the situation).\n\nI need to weigh the child's right to protect herself against the potential for escalation and the importance of non-violence. The parent's approach seems to be targeted at specific, non-lethal force in self-defense, which is different from random aggression. The daughter is being taught to act only when she's being harmed and to seek help afterward.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent is trying to teach their daughter to set boundaries and protect herself, which is a responsible approach given the failure of the daycare to address the issue. However, there might be a middle ground where the parent works with the daycare to address the other child's behavior instead of teaching physical response. But considering the situation as presented, the parent's intention is to protect their child, which is a valid concern.\n"
