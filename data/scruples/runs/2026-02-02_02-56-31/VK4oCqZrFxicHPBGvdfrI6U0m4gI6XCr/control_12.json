Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging her too forcefully. The parent explained that the kid is being aggressive and not stopping when told, leading to the daughter being uncomfortable. The parent advises using force to push back if needed, and the spouse disagrees, preferring to tell a teacher instead.\n\nSo, the key points here: the other child's behavior is unwelcome and violent, the teachers aren't effective, and the parent is teaching self-defense. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries, but the situation seems to involve a form of harassment. The parent is not encouraging random violence but specific, defensive actions. However, teaching a young child to use physical force could model aggressive behavior, even if well-intentioned. On the other hand, the child's safety and comfort are important. The parent might be trying to empower the child to protect herself when adults aren't stopping the issue. But there's also the aspect of whether a 4-year-old can handle the consequences, like the other child retaliating. The spouse is right that non-violent solutions should be prioritized, but in cases where those fail, self-defense might be necessary. It's a tricky balance. The parent might not be in the wrong, but maybe could have considered other approaches first. However, given the situation, advising the child to protect herself when in danger of being harmed is understandable. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
