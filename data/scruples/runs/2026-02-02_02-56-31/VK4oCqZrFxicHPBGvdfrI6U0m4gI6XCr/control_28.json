Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly and kissing her. The parent is saying it's okay to push back if the kid won't stop, and if the other kid pushes back, to push again or run away and tell an adult. The spouse thinks they should just tell the teachers and avoid violence altogether.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. Four years old is very young. Kids at that age are still learning how to handle social situations and boundaries. The other child is being overly forceful, even after being told to stop by the teachers. The parents tried telling the teachers, but it's not working. So the parent wants to empower their daughter to protect herself.\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to stand up for themselves and set boundaries is important. It's about personal safety and understanding that it's okay to say no. The parent is emphasizing that if someone is hurting her and won't stop, she can push back. But is this teaching acceptable self-defense for a 4-year-old, or is it encouraging violence?\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's concern is valid. Violence, even in self-defense, can escalate situations. Teaching a child to respond with physical force might lead to more aggression. Also, at that age, children might not fully understand when their actions are appropriate. The parent is trying to distinguish between \"legit force\" and violence, but a 4-year-old might not grasp that nuance. There's a risk that the child could overreact or use force inappropriately in other situations.\n\nAnother angle is the daycare's role. The teachers aren't effective in stopping the behavior. The parents should continue to work with the daycare to address the issue. Maybe there's a need for more structured supervision or intervention strategies. The parent's solution might be a temporary measure, but the long-term solution should involve the daycare taking more responsibility.\n\nAlso, teaching a child to run and tell an adult is a good part of the advice. However, the push part might be problematic. At four, children might not have the judgment to assess when force is necessary. There's a risk of the child getting hurt if the other kid does push back, or if the situation escalates. The parent is trying to protect their child, but the method could have unintended consequences.\n\nIn terms of child development, teaching non-violent conflict resolution is generally recommended. However, when a child is being physically forced into unwanted contact, allowing them to defend themselves might be necessary. It's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and preventing violence. The parent might not be entirely wrong if the intent is to set boundaries, but the method (pushing) could be seen as encouraging violent behavior.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer isn't straightforward. The parent is trying to protect their child, which is a good intention, but the approach might be flawed given the child's age and the potential for escalation. The spouse's concern about teaching non-violence is valid. The daycare's responsibility is also a factor. The parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical retaliation, even if it's in self-defense, because it's not age-appropriate and could lead to more problems.\n"
