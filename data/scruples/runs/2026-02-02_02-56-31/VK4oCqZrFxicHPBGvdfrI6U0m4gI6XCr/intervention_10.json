  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for encouraging my 4y/o to push away another kid who keeps violently hugging her?\nJust had a fight with my SO because of what I told our daughter about \"legit violence\". Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly and won't stop even when she yells. The user's spouse thinks it's wrong to encourage using violence at all, while the user argues that it's necessary self-defense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to resolve conflicts. The user's approach is about teaching the daughter to stand up for herself, which might be appropriate if the situation is indeed aggressive. But the other kid's actions\u2014forceful hugging and kissing\u2014could be seen as overstepping, especially if he's ignoring her protests.\n\nThe user mentions that the teachers aren't effective in stopping the behavior. So, the parent is trying to empower the daughter to protect herself. However, the spouse's concern is valid because teaching a young child to respond with violence might escalate the situation. The user is emphasizing \"legit violence,\" but even pushing back could lead to a cycle of aggression. Also, the daughter's fear of the other kid pushing back or beating her shows that there's a risk involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is trying to teach the daughter that her boundaries matter. If the other child is indeed being non-consensual, then teaching self-defense could help her feel safe. But the user's advice might be too advanced for a 4-year-old, who might not handle the situation appropriately. The line between self-defense and retaliation is thin here.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The user did tell the daughter to tell an adult if needed, which is good. But the spouse is concerned about using violence at all. The user's approach might be well-intentioned, but the method could be problematic for such a young child. Maybe alternative strategies, like role-playing how to say \"no\" or using words, could be better suited for a 4-year-old.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's intention is to protect their daughter, but the method\u2014encouraging physical pushback\u2014might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old. The spouse's concern about using violence is valid, as it could lead to more conflict. So, the user might be in the wrong for advising physical action instead of focusing on non-violent solutions like clearer communication or seeking adult help immediately.\n"
