Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're at fault for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The SO is upset, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence. The author argues it's necessary to use \"legit force\" when the other kid is being violent and the teachers aren't effective.\n\nFirst, the kid is 4, so they're very young. The other child is using what the parent considers violent force by hugging and kissing, not stopping even when the daughter yells. The parent is advising their daughter to push back or run to an adult. The teachers are aware but don't see it often, and the kid doesn't stop. \n\nI need to consider child safety and appropriate ways to handle such situations. Teaching a child to use physical force to defend themselves could be seen as a form of self-defense, especially if the other child is aggressive and adults aren't intervening. However, at 4 years old, children are still learning social skills and the consequences of their actions. Encouraging physical action might lead to more conflict or the perception that such behavior is acceptable.\n\nThe parent mentions they are strict about not using violence otherwise, so it's not about promoting aggression in general. The key here is the child's right to set boundaries and the parent's approach to teaching that. The daughter already tried telling the teachers, but it's not working. So the parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself.\n\nBut there's also the perspective that even at a young age, resolving conflicts through non-violent means (like reporting, not fighting) is better. The parent's advice might be practical in the moment, but could the child understand the difference between appropriate defensive actions and starting a fight? The line is thin, and the parent's intent seems protective, but the method could be controversial.\n\nAlso, the other child's behavior is concerning. If it's not addressed, it might be a sign of future issues. The parents might need to talk to the daycare more thoroughly, maybe the other child's parents. However, the user is focused on their immediate action\u2014teaching their daughter to push away.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're trying to protect their child. On the other, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force could lead to unintended consequences. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific situation, but since the other child isn't responsive to adult intervention, the parent's approach might be reasonable as a last resort. Still, some might argue that even minimal violence should be avoided. I think the answer is B (No), because the parent is teaching self-defense and boundary-setting, but it's a close call.\n"
