Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The spouse thinks they should have told the teachers instead, but the parent argues it's about defending against violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is being overly aggressive, not stopping even when the daughter tells him to. The teachers aren't effective in stopping it. The parent's advice is about using self-defense, which is a common approach in self-defense teachings. But with a 4-year-old, the ability to assess and respond appropriately is a factor.\n\nThe spouse's concern is about using violence, even if minimal. However, the parent is distinguishing between legitimate force to stop harm and unprovoked violence. The key here is whether a 4-year-old can understand the difference between defensive actions and aggressive ones. The daughter already knows to tell the teachers but it's not working. The parent is giving her options to protect herself in the moment.\n\nIn many parenting guides, teaching children to set boundaries is important. However, physical force should be a last resort. But in this case, the child is being physically forced into interactions she doesn't want. The parent's advice includes pushing back or running away and telling an adult, which are reasonable self-defense strategies.\n\nLegally and ethically, teaching a child to defend themselves from unwelcome physical contact could be justified, especially if the other child's actions are abusive or harmful. The parent isn't encouraging fighting for fun but responding to a specific threat. However, there's also a responsibility to ensure the child doesn't escalate the situation. The spouse's concern might be about the child learning that physical force is acceptable, which could lead to more aggressive behavior in the future.\n\nAnother angle is the daycare's role. It seems the daycare isn't addressing the issue adequately, so the parent is stepping in. It's possible that the parent should also be more proactive in working with the daycare to resolve the issue, rather than relying solely on the child to handle it. But given that the daycare isn't effective, the parent's approach might be necessary for the child's immediate safety and comfort.\n\nConsidering all these points, the parent's actions are aimed at protecting their daughter from unwanted and potentially harmful physical contact. The advice is specific to a situation where the child is being forced and the aggressor isn't listening. The parent isn't endorsing violence in general but teaching self-defense in a specific context. Therefore, it's a balanced approach between setting boundaries and self-protection.\n"
