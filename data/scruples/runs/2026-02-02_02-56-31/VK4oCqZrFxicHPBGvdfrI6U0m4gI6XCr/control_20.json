Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The parent says the other kid doesn't stop even when the daughter yells, and the teachers aren't seeing it happen. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push him away if he's being violent, and if he pushes back, to push back or run to an adult. The spouse thinks it's wrong to use violence, suggesting instead to tell the teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, kids are still developing social skills and understanding boundaries. The parent is trying to teach self-defense, which might be necessary if the other child is aggressive. However, encouraging physical response, even as a defense, could lead to more conflict or teach that aggression is okay. The parent argues it's about legitimate force, not violence, but the line can be thin for a young child.\n\nThe daycare teachers aren't effective in stopping the behavior, so the parent is trying to empower their child. But maybe there are other options, like more direct communication with the daycare or the other parents. The spouse's concern is valid because teaching a child to use force might escalate the situation. Also, pushing could be seen as starting a fight, even if in self-defense. The parent might be right in wanting to protect their child, but maybe the approach isn't the best for a 4-year-old. The answer depends on balancing child safety with appropriate conflict resolution for that age. So, maybe the parent is not entirely wrong, but there could be better methods. However, the spouse's point about non-violence is important. I'm leaning towards the parent is not in the wrong (B) but unsure. Alternatively, maybe they are in the wrong (A) because teaching a 4-year-old to push back might not be the right approach. Hmm.\n"
