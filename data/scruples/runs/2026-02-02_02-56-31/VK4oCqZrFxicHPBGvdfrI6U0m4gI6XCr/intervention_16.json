Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop even after she yells. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being physically uncomfortable with another kid's hugging and kissing. The daughter has reported it to teachers, but they don't see it and the behavior continues. The parent is trying to teach their child self-defense, but the spouse is against it because they don't want violence at all.\n\n4-year-olds have limited understanding of boundaries and self-defense. Teaching a child to push someone might escalate the situation. Even if the parent is teaching it as a last resort, a 4-year-old might not discern when to use that. Also, physical retaliation could lead to the other child reacting badly, as the daughter suggested. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself from unwanted physical contact. But is pushing appropriate? Maybe there are better ways, like teaching the child to say \"no\" firmly, remove herself, or seek help immediately. The parent might have good intentions but the method could be problematic. \n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because teaching any form of violence, even as a defense, might normalize it. But the parent is trying to address an immediate issue where other methods (telling teachers) aren't working. However, the daycare's role is to ensure safety. Maybe the parent should involve the daycare more formally, or discuss strategies with teachers to monitor and address the behavior. \n\nIn terms of age-appropriate advice for a 4-year-old, maybe pushing isn't the best approach. The child might not have the physical or emotional maturity to handle such a reaction. The parent might be in the right in intent but the method is questionable. So, the answer could be AITA, meaning they're in the wrong in their approach.\n"
