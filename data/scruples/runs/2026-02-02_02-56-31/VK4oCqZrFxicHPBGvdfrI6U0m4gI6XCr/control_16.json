Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her forcefully, despite the child being told by teachers and not stopping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being hugged and kissed in a way that's making her uncomfortable, even when she yells for the other kid to stop. The parent is telling their daughter it's okay to push back if it's violent. The spouse is against it, thinking she should just tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the child's autonomy and safety. At 4 years old, she's very young, but the parent is teaching her to protect herself. The other child isn't stopping even after being told, so the parent is trying to instill a sense of self-defense. However, some might argue that encouraging a 4-year-old to use physical force could escalate the situation or set a bad precedent. But then again, the child is being taught to recognize boundaries and respond to unwelcome physical contact, which is important for her safety.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid too. Teaching non-violence is a good principle, but there's a difference between general violence and self-defense. The parent clarifies they're not teaching random violence, just defending against unwanted force. The child is old enough to understand the concept of boundaries and the difference between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.\n\nAlso, the teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, so the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself. It's a balance between teaching her to stand up for herself versus avoiding conflict. Since the other child is not stopping and the situation is recurring, the parent's approach might be necessary to prevent ongoing discomfort or harm. So, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
