Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The key points here are the child's age, the nature of the other kid's actions, and the advice given.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a 4-year-old who's being hugged and kissed in a way that's uncomfortable. The author supports the child pushing back if the other kid doesn't stop despite the child trying to tell them. The spouse argues against using any violence, even in self-defense. \n\nNow, considering child safety and age-appropriate guidance. At 4, kids are still learning boundaries and how to assert themselves. The other child's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the daycare staff isn't effectively addressing it. The author's advice is about using \"legit force\" to stop unwanted physical contact. However, teaching a young child to push back might escalate the situation, leading to physical conflict. On the other hand, the child's right to protect herself from uncomfortable or harmful interactions is valid.\n\nBut here's the catch: the daycare's responsibility is to handle such issues. Parents might expect the daycare to intervene. The author's approach might be seen as teaching aggression, even if it's for self-defense. However, the alternative is the child feeling helpless in a situation where her complaints aren't being heard. The spouse's concern is about promoting non-violence, which is important, but so is empowering the child to set boundaries.\n\nLooking at child development, 4-year-olds often don't understand the concept of consent in the same way adults do. The daycare isn't resolving the issue, so the child might not have other options. The author's advice is practical in the moment, but there's a risk it could lead to more conflict. The spouse's approach relies on reporting, which is standard, but if that's not working, the child needs another method.\n\nIn legal or parenting terms, encouraging a child to defend themselves in such a scenario is a common debate. Some experts advocate for teaching children to set boundaries, while others stress non-violent communication. Since the other child isn't stopping and the daycare isn't acting, the author's approach could be seen as necessary for the child's safety. However, the method might be questionable because pushing could lead to a cycle of violence between the kids.\n\nSo, weighing the options: the author's intention is to protect their child from unwanted physical contact, which is valid. The means (teaching to push back) might be seen as teaching aggression, but it's also about self-defense. The daycare's failure to act is a factor here. The spouse's concern is valid too, but the situation isn't ideal, and the author is trying to find a solution in an environment where the usual channels aren't working.\n\nIn the end, the author's approach is a practical response to a problem that isn't being addressed properly. While teaching non-violence is important, the immediate need to protect the child from persistent unwanted physical contact might justify the advice given. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
