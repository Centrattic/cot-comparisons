Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The main issue here is about how to handle uncomfortable physical interactions between young children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is being overly affectionate in a way that's making the daughter uncomfortable. The daughter has already tried telling the other kid to stop, but it's not working. The parents have talked to the teachers, but they haven't been effective. So the parent is teaching their daughter to use physical force to defend herself if the other kid won't stop. The spouse disagrees, thinks the daughter should only tell the teachers and not use any violence.\n\nThe user's perspective is that they're teaching the daughter to defend herself in a situation where someone is being violent towards her. They mention that they don't encourage random violence but that this is a case of \"legit violence\" in self-defense. The daughter's age is 4, so she's very young. The parent is trying to help her understand when it's okay to push back, but the spouse is worried about promoting violence in general.\n\nNow, considering child development, at 4 years old, kids are still learning boundaries and how to communicate their feelings. It's important to teach them to express discomfort and seek help. However, in this case, the daughter's attempts to communicate (screaming) haven't worked, and the teachers aren't catching it. So the parent is stepping in to teach self-defense measures.\n\nBut there's a debate here: is it appropriate for a 4-year-old to be taught to use physical force? Some might argue that even at that age, kids can learn to set boundaries through non-violent means, like moving away or yelling for help. Others might say that teaching a child to protect themselves in a way that's proportional is important, especially if the other child is being aggressive.\n\nThe parent's advice includes pushing back and running away to tell an adult. They didn't encourage hitting or beating the other kid, just pushing if necessary. The spouse is concerned that any form of violence, even in self-defense, is wrong. However, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when the usual methods (telling the other kid to stop, telling the teachers) aren't working.\n\nI need to think about the balance between teaching non-violence and teaching self-protection. There's also the aspect of the other child's behavior\u2014maybe there's an underlying issue with him, but the parent's immediate concern is their daughter's safety and comfort.\n\nIn terms of parenting approaches, some experts might argue that even at a young age, children should be taught to advocate for themselves without resorting to physical aggression. Others might support the parent's approach, emphasizing the importance of self-defense in certain situations.\n\nBut since the daughter is so young, it's possible that using physical force could escalate the situation or lead to the other child retaliating, which the daughter herself mentioned as a concern. The parent's advice to push back again or run away and tell an adult seems to address that possibility.\n\nSo, the parent is trying to give the daughter practical strategies when communication and reporting haven't worked. The spouse's approach is more about relying on adults to handle the situation. The question is whether teaching a child to use physical force in self-defense is appropriate in this context.\n\nI think the answer depends on the specific circumstances and the parent's judgment. Since the other methods have failed and the child is in an uncomfortable situation, teaching her to protect herself might be justified. However, the key is ensuring that the child understands when it's appropriate to use such force and that it's a last resort after trying to tell the other child to stop and then telling an adult.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent might not be in the wrong because they're addressing their daughter's immediate needs in a situation where she's being physically uncomfortable. They're not promoting random violence but teaching a specific, limited form of self-defense when other methods fail. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
