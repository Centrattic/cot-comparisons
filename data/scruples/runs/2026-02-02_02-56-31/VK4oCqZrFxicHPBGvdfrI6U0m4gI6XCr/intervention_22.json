Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to involve teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's safety and well-being. The other kid is engaging in behavior that's making the daughter uncomfortable, even after she's told him to stop. The parents are trying to teach her self-defense in a situation where she's being harassed. At 4 years old, kids are still very physical, but this seems like it crosses into inappropriate territory, especially since the other child isn't respecting her boundaries even after being told.\n\nThe parents are advising their daughter to use force to protect herself if necessary. The spouse is worried that teaching a child to use violence sets a bad example. But in this case, it's about protecting oneself from unwanted, possibly aggressive behavior. The parent argues that it's \"legit violence\" when someone is being forced upon. \n\nHowever, there's a concern about escalating the situation. If the other child retaliates, the daughter might get hurt, and teaching a child to push back could lead to more conflict. But the parent is also emphasizing that if the child is in danger, self-defense is acceptable. \n\nDaycare teachers have a responsibility to monitor the children, but sometimes they can't be everywhere. The daughter has already reported the behavior, but it's not being addressed effectively. So the parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself until the daycare can handle it properly.\n\nI think the key points are: the child is being harassed, the parent is teaching self-defense in a specific context where safety is at risk, and the spouse is concerned about promoting violence. However, teaching a child to protect themselves in such a scenario is understandable, especially when other methods aren't working. So the parent isn't necessarily wrong, but there might be a balance to consider between self-defense and non-violence.\n"
