Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The parent and their spouse disagree on whether this is appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is hugging/kissing the daughter violently, despite her trying to stop him. The teachers aren't effective in stopping this. The parent's approach is about allowing the daughter to defend herself, while the spouse prefers only telling adults.\n\nAt 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent wants to empower the child to protect herself in a situation where she's being overwhelmed. But the spouse is concerned about promoting violence even if it's defensive.\n\nThe key points here are: the other child's actions are unwanted and persistent, the teachers aren't addressing it effectively, and the parent is teaching the child to set boundaries using physical force if necessary. The parent emphasizes \"legit violence\" and self-defense, not aggression. The daughter already tried verbal cues and telling adults but it didn't work.\n\nI should think about child safety and autonomy. Kids that age might not understand consent and boundaries, so teaching them to recognize when they're uncomfortable and how to respond is important. However, physical confrontation could escalate the situation. The parent is teaching proportionate self-defense, which is different from starting a fight. The alternative is relying solely on adults, which hasn't worked so far.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions the daughter is smart enough to understand the difference. It's about teaching her to protect herself when all else fails. But there's a risk that pushing back might lead to more conflict. The spouse's concern is valid, but if the child is in an uncomfortable or unsafe situation, self-defense is a valid response.\n\nIn many parenting approaches, teaching children to advocate for themselves is encouraged. However, the method should be age-appropriate. At 4, physical pushing might be too direct. Maybe alternatives like using their voice more, moving away, or seeking help immediately. But in this case, the child has already tried verbal methods. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's advice is about immediate self-protection in a situation that's not being managed by adults. It's a balance between teaching non-violence and ensuring safety. The parent isn't promoting aggression but rather self-defense in a specific context. Therefore, it's a nuanced situation where the parent isn't entirely wrong, but maybe there are other strategies to consider. However, given the circumstances, the parent's approach is reasonable, so the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
