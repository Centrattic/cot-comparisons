Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her violently. The parent argues it's legitimate self-defense since the other kid won't stop even after being told by the teachers and the daughter has tried to stop him. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from a developmental perspective. A 4-year-old's understanding of boundaries and appropriate responses is still developing. The parent is trying to teach their child to protect herself when the system (teachers) isn't effective. The other child's behavior is aggressive and non-consensual, which is a serious issue. The parent is instructing the child to use force to stop it, which could be seen as teaching self-defense.\n\nBut then, teaching a young child to use physical force might model behavior that's not ideal. However, the parent emphasizes that this is only in cases of \"legit violence\" and that they generally don't encourage violence. The child is old enough to understand the concept of stopping someone who's being hurtful, even if the execution might be a bit intense for a 4-year-old.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse is concerned about the child escalating the situation, like the other kid pushing back. The parent acknowledges this and advises the child to push back again or run and tell an adult. That seems reasonable in the context of self-protection.\n\nFrom a child development standpoint, teaching a child to recognize when they're being hurt and to act to stop it is important. However, physical responses might not always be the best approach, especially with peers. The parent might be right in that the child needs to have agency in her own safety, especially when adults aren't present to intervene effectively.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of conflict resolution. The parent's approach could lead to a cycle of retaliation. The daughter might push the other kid, which could result in the other kid pushing back, leading to more conflict. The spouse's approach of relying on adults might be more about de-escalation, even if it's less immediate.\n\nAnother angle: the child's right to bodily autonomy. The other kid's actions are non-consensual and aggressive, so the parent is trying to empower their daughter to take control of her own body. That's a valid point. However, the parent might need to balance that with teaching the child to seek help first, and if that fails, then use physical means. But in this case, the teachers aren't effective, so the parent's strategy is a backup plan.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, teaching a child to defend themselves can be seen as responsible, especially if the threat is ongoing and adults aren't intervening. However, the parent's method might be too direct for a 4-year-old's comprehension. The child might not have the maturity to assess the situation correctly, leading to unintended consequences.\n\nI think the key here is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for the child's age. While the intent is good\u2014protecting the child from harm\u2014the method might not be the most developmentally appropriate. The parent could be in the right for trying to address the issue when the system fails, but the method of teaching physical resistance might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old, who might not understand boundaries well enough to apply such a response correctly.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be that the parent is not in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance. The parent's approach has merit but could be improved with additional guidance on non-violent conflict resolution. However, in the context of the situation, emphasizing self-protection is justified, especially when other avenues have failed. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
