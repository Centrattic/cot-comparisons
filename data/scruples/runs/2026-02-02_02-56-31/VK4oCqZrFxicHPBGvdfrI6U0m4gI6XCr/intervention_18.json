Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the parent (the person asking) is at fault for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's being physically aggressive.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is in daycare with another kid who hugs and kisses her forcefully, even when she yells to stop. The teachers aren't catching it, so the parent tells the daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid is hurting her. The spouse thinks this is wrong and insists on reporting to teachers instead of using violence.\n\nThe parent argues that they're not advocating violence but appropriate self-defense. The key points here are the child's safety, the age, and the appropriateness of the advice given the situation.\n\nAt 4 years old, children are still learning how to handle social interactions. The other child's behavior is potentially aggressive and not respectful of personal boundaries. The daycare staff isn't addressing it effectively. The parent is trying to teach their child to protect herself in a situation where the other child isn't respecting her wishes. \n\nHowever, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might have downsides. It could escalate the situation, lead to the child seeing aggression as acceptable, or result in the other child's parents being upset. The spouse's concern about non-violent solutions (like telling a teacher) is valid, as the daycare should handle such issues. \n\nBut the parent's reasoning is that when other methods fail and the child is being harmed, self-defense is necessary. The line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence is blurry here. The advice given is to push away, not hit or hurt, which might be considered a reasonable response to unwanted physical contact.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent's intention is to protect their child from harm, and the guidance is specific to defending against immediate harm. Since the daycare isn't effective, the parent is trying to empower their child. However, the spouse's concern about violence is also valid. The correct answer might hinge on whether the advice is proportionate and appropriate for a 4-year-old's understanding. \n\nBut given that the parent is emphasizing \"legit force\" and not violence, and the situation involves a child who won't stop after being told, it's a balance between safety and teaching non-aggression. I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the parent is responding to a real threat to their child's safety and autonomy, and the response is a way to teach the child to protect herself when adults aren't able to intervene.\n"
