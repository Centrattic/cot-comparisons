Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and kissing her without consent.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a child experiencing uncomfortable physical contact from another child. The parents have already reported to teachers, but the behavior persists. The parent's advice is to use force if the other child is violent and doesn't stop. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to rely on teachers and avoid violence.\n\nSo, the user's perspective is that they're teaching their child self-defense in a situation where she's being harmed. The spouse argues against encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense.\n\nI need to consider child psychology and appropriate behavior for a 4-year-old. At that age, children might not understand boundaries well, and parents often guide them on how to handle such situations. The user's advice is to push back or run to an adult. But encouraging a child to push another might escalate the situation. However, the user differentiates between \"legit violence\" (self-defense) and random aggression. \n\nThere's also the aspect of teaching consent and personal boundaries. The user is helping their daughter recognize when her boundaries are being crossed and how to respond. But the method of response (pushing) could be seen as setting a bad example, especially since the daughter is very young and might not fully grasp when force is appropriate.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because young children might not understand the nuances and could use the advice inappropriately. However, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself in a situation where adults aren't responding effectively.\n\nIt's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding the promotion of physical conflict. The answer likely depends on whether the advice is seen as necessary self-defense or as encouraging aggression. Given the context, the parent is trying to help the child in a situation where the system (teachers) isn't working. But promoting physical resistance in a 4-year-old might not be the best approach, as it could lead to more harm or escalate the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions are good, the method might be problematic. So, the answer might lean towards AITA being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
