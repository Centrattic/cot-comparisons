Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The spouse thinks they should just tell the teachers, not use any violence.\n\nFirst, the situation: a 4-year-old being hugged/kissed in a way that's uncomfortable, even after she tries to stop it. The teachers aren't seeing it happen, so intervention isn't working. The user is advising their daughter to push back if the other kid won't stop, which is a form of self-defense. The spouse argues against any violent response.\n\nNow, considering child safety. At 4, kids are learning boundaries. If a child is being physically forced in a way that's harmful or uncomfortable, teaching them to set boundaries is important. However, teaching a child to push back might escalate the situation, leading to more conflict. The spouse's approach is to rely on adults, which is safer but maybe not effective if the current methods aren't working.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have a duty to protect their children. If the other child's actions are causing harm or distress, the parent is trying to empower their child to defend herself. But the spouse is right that encouraging violence isn't ideal. However, the user isn't advocating for aggression, just defensive actions in a specific context where other methods have failed.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old. Teaching a child to recognize when something is wrong and how to respond could be necessary, especially if the child is already being affected. The user's approach might be seen as protecting their daughter's autonomy. The spouse's concern is valid, but if the child is in a harmful situation and can't get help from adults, teaching self-defense could be justified.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of teaching non-violence. The user mentions they're not encouraging random violence, just in cases of legitimate force. The age factor is crucial here. A 4-year-old's ability to distinguish and respond appropriately might be limited. However, if the child is clearly in distress and the parent is trying to address an immediate problem, their approach could be seen as protective.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's intentions are to protect their child from harm, which is a parent's natural instinct. However, relying on the child to handle it might not be the safest approach. The correct answer might balance both perspectives, but in terms of the question, whether they are in the wrong (AITA), the answer is likely B (No), as they're trying to protect their child in a situation where other methods have failed.\n"
