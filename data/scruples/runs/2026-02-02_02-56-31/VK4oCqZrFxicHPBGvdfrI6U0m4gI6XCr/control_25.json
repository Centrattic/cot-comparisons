Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is advising a 4-year-old to push away another child who's giving uncomfortable hugs and kisses. The kid in question isn't stopping even when the daughter says no, and the teachers aren't catching it. The parent's reasoning is that if someone is using force and not respecting the child's boundaries, it's okay to push back. The spouse thinks she should have only told the teachers and avoided any violence.\n\nFirst, the child is 4, so she's very young. Teaching her to use physical force even in self-defense might be problematic because kids her age might not discern when and how to use it appropriately. However, the situation described is about unwanted physical contact that the other child isn't stopping despite the daughter's attempts to stop it. The parent is trying to teach her to set boundaries and protect herself.\n\nBut at 4 years old, the child might not understand the difference between appropriate defense and aggression. There's a risk she could escalate the situation or get hurt in the process. The parent's approach emphasizes immediate action, while the spouse prefers reporting to adults. \n\nI think the parent's intention is good\u2014to teach her boundaries. However, advising a 4-year-old to push back might not be the best method. Teaching non-violent ways to assert herself, like removing herself from the situation or reporting immediately, might be more effective and safer. So the parent might be in the wrong by endorsing physical action, even if well-intentioned.\n"
