Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push another kid who's forcefully hugging and kissing her. The parent says the child already told the teachers, but it's not working. The parent taught the child to push back if the other kid doesn't stop, and even to push back if the other kid pushes back. The spouse is upset, thinking it's better to just tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the child's safety and how to handle unwanted physical contact. At 4 years old, the child is very young. Teaching her to use physical force might escalate the situation. The other child is also a kid, but his behavior is aggressive. The parent's intention is to protect their daughter, which is understandable. However, encouraging a child to push someone else, even in self-defense, might not be the best approach in a daycare setting where adults are supposed to manage such interactions.\n\nThe daycare teachers didn't take action when informed, which is a problem. But the parent's advice could lead to more conflict. The spouse is right to be concerned about promoting violence, even if it's self-defense. The parent argues it's \"legit force\" in a violent situation, but a 4-year-old might not fully grasp the difference between defending themselves and starting a fight. Also, if the other child retaliates, the situation could get worse, as the daughter was worried about.\n\nThere are alternative strategies. Maybe the parent could work with the daycare to get more consistent supervision or involve the other child's parents if necessary. Teaching the daughter to clearly say \"no\" and seek help from adults immediately might be more effective. The parent might have overestimated the child's ability to handle physical confrontation at that age. So, while the parent's concern is valid, the method of advising physical resistance might not be appropriate. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong for encouraging physical action instead of seeking adult intervention.\n"
