Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another kid is in the wrong. The situation involves a child who's being hugged too forcefully and kissed without consent by another kid. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push him away if he's hurting her and won't stop, and even to push back or run away if he retaliates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Four years old is very young, and their understanding of personal boundaries and conflict resolution is still developing. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself, which is a good intention. However, the method suggested involves using physical force. The other parent argues that it's better to involve teachers instead of using violence.\n\nThe key points here are consent, safety, and appropriate responses for a child's age. The other child is being aggressive without considering the daughter's comfort. The teachers haven't been effective in stopping the behavior, so the parent is trying an alternative approach. But teaching a young child to use physical force might escalate the situation, especially if the other child is also aggressive. The daughter is worried about retaliation, and the parent told her to push back or run away. \n\nOn one hand, the parent is protecting their child's autonomy and safety by teaching her to stand up for herself. On the other hand, encouraging physical confrontation at such a young age could set a precedent for using violence to solve problems. It's important to consider whether the parent's advice is age-appropriate and if there are better ways to handle this. Maybe teaching non-violent strategies first, like clearly expressing discomfort, moving away, or seeking adult help immediately, could be more effective and safer.\n\nAlso, the parent mentioned they are firm in raising their daughter against violence in general. This suggests they don't want her to use violence casually, but in this case, it's framed as a legitimate defense. The line between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression might be thin here. The other kid's parents being overbearing might also play a role, but that's not directly the parent's fault.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their child, the method might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old. Teaching non-violent conflict resolution and ensuring the child knows to seek help from adults could be more appropriate. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for suggesting physical confrontation in this scenario.\n"
