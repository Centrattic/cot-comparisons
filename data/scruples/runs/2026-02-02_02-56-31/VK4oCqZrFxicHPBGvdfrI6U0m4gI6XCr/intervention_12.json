Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The parents argue about the best approach\u2014using self-defense or relying on adults to intervene.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The user's approach is to teach their daughter to use \"legit force\" if the other child is being too aggressive. The spouse thinks it's better to teach her to avoid violence and just tell the teachers. \n\nI should think about child development. Young children might not understand the concept of appropriate force versus violence. If the daughter pushes back, the other child might react, leading to a physical altercation. The user's intention is to protect their daughter from unwanted contact, which is important, but the method might be too advanced for her age. \n\nAlso, the daycare's role is crucial. Even if the teachers aren't always present when it happens, it's their responsibility to address the behavior of the other child. The user's advice might be well-intentioned, but encouraging a 4-year-old to physically resist could escalate the situation. The spouse's concern is valid because teaching non-violent solutions and consistent communication with adults is typically recommended for young kids.\n\nAnother angle is the message being sent. The user wants their daughter to know she can defend herself if necessary, but at 4, the emphasis should be on safety and reporting issues. The line between \"legit force\" and violence is thin and might not be clear to a child. \n\nSo, while the user's intention is to protect their daughter, the method might not be age-appropriate. The spouse's approach of relying on adults and non-violent solutions aligns more with standard child-rearing advice for this age. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for encouraging physical resistance instead of focusing on safe, non-violent strategies.\n"
