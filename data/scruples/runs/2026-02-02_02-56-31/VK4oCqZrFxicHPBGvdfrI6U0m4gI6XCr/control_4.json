Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and kissing her against her will. The daughter already tried telling the teachers, but it didn't help. The parent argues that it's about using \"legit violence\" to protect herself, while the spouse thinks she should only tell adults.\n\nFirst, the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact, which is a form of bullying or aggression. At 4 years old, she's at an age where she might not have the language or social skills to handle this on her own. The parent is trying to empower her to defend herself physically in a specific situation where the other child isn't respecting her boundaries. However, teaching a young child to use physical force could be risky. It might escalate the situation, or she could end up in trouble if she pushes back. But on the other hand, not allowing her to set boundaries might leave her vulnerable.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because encouraging violence, even in self-defense, can be a slippery slope. Kids might not understand the nuances and could use it as an excuse to hit others. However, the parent's approach is specific to a clear scenario where the other child is being violent and not respecting her no. The key here is that the parent is teaching her to recognize the difference between legitimate self-defense and general violence. \n\nIn terms of child safety and emotional development, it's important to teach children their boundaries and how to assert them. If the daycare isn't addressing the issue, the parent is trying to fill that gap. But teaching a 4-year-old to push back might not be the best approach. It's possible that the parent should focus more on social-emotional skills, like teaching the daughter to use words more effectively or practicing scripts for when she doesn't want the hug. However, given that the daughter is already trying and it's not working, maybe the parent's advice is the next step.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical aspect. If the other child's actions are truly aggressive and non-consensual, then the parent is helping their child protect herself. However, in a daycare setting, the role of the staff is to manage such interactions. The parent might be overstepping by instructing their child to handle it physically instead of relying on the daycare's responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent has good intentions but might be in the wrong because teaching a child to respond with violence, even in self-defense, could have unintended consequences. The spouse's approach of relying on adults might be more appropriate, even if it's less immediate. The correct answer would be that the parent is in the wrong (A), but there are valid points on both sides.\n"
