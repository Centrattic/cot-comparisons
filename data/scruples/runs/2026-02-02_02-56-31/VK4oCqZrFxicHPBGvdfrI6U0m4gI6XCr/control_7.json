Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another kid is in the wrong. The situation involves a child who's being hugged too forcefully and kissed without consent. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push the kid away if he won't stop, even suggesting pushing back or running to an adult if needed. The spouse thinks this is wrong and advises against using violence and to tell the teacher instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's making her uncomfortable. The teachers aren't effectively addressing it, and the other child isn't stopping. The parent's advice is about self-defense in a situation where the child is being forced. The parent emphasizes using \"legit force\" and not promoting violence otherwise.\n\nNow, considering child safety and consent. Teaching a child to protect themselves is important. At 4 years old, they might not have the language skills to articulate their discomfort effectively, so physical boundaries could be a way to stop the behavior. On the other hand, teaching non-violent solutions is also valuable. The spouse's argument is about using the system (teachers) and avoiding any form of retaliation.\n\nBut the key here is that the other child is being violent and not respecting boundaries. The parent is advising the daughter to set her own boundaries in a way that stops the unwanted contact. The advice isn't about initiating violence but responding to it. The parent also mentions that the child is old enough to understand the difference between legitimate self-defense and just being violent.\n\nPossible angles: some might argue that even at a young age, promoting any form of violent response could be detrimental. Others might say that it's necessary to empower the child to protect herself when adults aren't effective. Also, the child's emotional development and the message it sends about conflict resolution.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the parent is trying to protect their child from ongoing unwanted behavior that's affecting her well-being. The spouse's concern is valid, but the parent's approach is about immediate self-protection when other methods have failed. The parent isn't encouraging random aggression but teaching the child to defend herself in a specific, violent situation.\n\nSo, the parent is probably not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
