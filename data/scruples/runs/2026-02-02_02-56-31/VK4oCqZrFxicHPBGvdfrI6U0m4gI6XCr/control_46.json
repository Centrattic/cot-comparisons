Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The parent is asking if they're at fault for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and even kissing her. The daughter already told the teachers, but the teachers aren't catching it, and the other kid won't stop. The parent advised pushing back as a form of self-defense, but the spouse thinks the daughter should only tell an adult and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young, and their understanding of boundaries and appropriate responses might not be fully developed. The parent is trying to teach their daughter about personal space and self-defense. But the spouse is concerned that encouraging any form of violence, even in defense, might be setting a bad example, especially since they generally discourage violence.\n\nThe situation involves a same-age child, so the parent's advice might be about immediate self-protection. However, the alternative is relying on adults, who might not always be present. The parent's approach seems to be about empowering the child to protect herself. But for a 4-year-old, the ability to assess when to push back and when to run might be too advanced. Also, there's a risk that the other child might retaliate, as the daughter mentioned, which the parent acknowledged by advising to push back or run and tell an adult.\n\nAnother angle is the daycare's responsibility. Since the teachers aren't catching it, maybe the parent should have escalated the issue more, like involving the daycare in a more formal way or discussing with the other child's parents. But the parent says the teachers aren't seeing it, so maybe that's not feasible.\n\nLegally and ethically, teaching a child to defend themselves is a common practice, but the appropriateness can depend on the context. Since it's between children, the parent's approach might be seen as reasonable because the child can't always wait for an adult. However, some might argue that violence (even in defense) between children isn't appropriate and could lead to more conflict.\n\nThe key points are the child's age, the nature of the other child's actions (which are more about inappropriate force than actual violent intent), and the parent's intent to protect their daughter. The parent is trying to protect their child from uncomfortable or potentially harmful situations, but the spouse is concerned about promoting violence.\n\nIn the end, it's a balance between empowering the child and avoiding the use of violence. Since the parent's advice is specific to situations where the other child is being violent and not stopping, and the daughter is being taught to defend herself only when necessary, it might be justified. However, others might argue that even at this age, all conflicts should be resolved without violence, no matter the provocation. So, the answer could be either way depending on perspective.\n"
