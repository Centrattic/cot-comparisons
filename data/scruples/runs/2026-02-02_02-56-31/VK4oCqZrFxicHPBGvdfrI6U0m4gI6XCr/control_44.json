Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push another kid who's hugging/kissing her too roughly. The daughter already tried telling the teachers, but it didn't work. The parent argues that if someone is hurting their child and won't stop, self-defense is justified. The spouse disagrees, saying non-violence and telling teachers is better.\n\nFirst, considering the age of the kids, 4 years old. At that age, kids might not fully understand boundaries or how to handle such situations. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself, which can be a good thing. But using physical force could escalate the situation. The parent mentions that the child is old enough to understand the difference between appropriate and inappropriate touch, but maybe the child isn't mature enough to handle pushing back without causing more conflict.\n\nAlso, the parent emphasizes that the child shouldn't beat others up, just use \"legit force\" in specific situations. The key here is whether teaching a child to use physical force is appropriate. Some might argue that it's necessary for self-defense, especially if the other child is aggressive. Others might say that it's better to teach non-violence and problem-solving through communication, even with young kids.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid. Telling a 4-year-old to push back might lead her to think it's okay to use violence in other situations. However, the parent's advice is specific to a situation where the other child is being violent. The balance here is tricky. The parent wants to protect their child, but also doesn't want to encourage violence.\n\nIn terms of child development, experts often advise teaching children to assert themselves and communicate their boundaries. Physical force might not be the first solution. However, if the child is in a situation where they're being physically forced, teaching them a way to stop the immediate discomfort could be necessary. The parent is providing options: push back, run away, or tell an adult. That seems like a balanced approach, giving the child tools to handle the situation either physically or non-physically.\n\nAnother angle: the other child's behavior is concerning. If the daycare isn't addressing it, maybe the parent should escalate the issue to the daycare management or even the other parents if necessary. But the parent is focusing on their daughter's response. The question is whether the parent's advice is appropriate given the circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent is trying to protect their child from uncomfortable situations, which is a natural instinct. However, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best approach. The spouse's concern about encouraging violence is valid. The parent might not be in the wrong since the situation is about self-defense, but there's a middle ground between teaching self-protection and promoting aggression. The answer might hinge on the context and the parent's intent versus the child's understanding.\n"
