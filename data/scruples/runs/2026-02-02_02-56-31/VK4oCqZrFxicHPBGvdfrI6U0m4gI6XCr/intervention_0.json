Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The main issue is whether teaching a child to use physical force in such a situation is appropriate.\n\nFirst, the situation: the other child is being overly aggressive, and the daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent is advising the daughter to push back if the other kid won't stop. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to rely on teachers and avoid violence.\n\nSo, from a child-rearing perspective, there's a balance between teaching self-defense and promoting non-violence. At 4 years old, the child is still learning social norms and how to handle conflicts. The parent's approach is about self-defense, which some might agree with because it empowers the child to protect herself. However, others might argue that encouraging even minimal physical retaliation, even if it's just pushing, could set a precedent for using violence or escalate the situation.\n\nThe child is also concerned about the other kid pushing back or hitting her. The parent's advice to push back and run to an adult might be seen as practical, but there's the risk that the child might misinterpret the situation or use force inappropriately. The spouse's concern is valid because involving teachers is a more controlled approach. However, if the teachers aren't effectively addressing the problem, the parent might feel compelled to take other measures.\n\nAnother angle is the child's understanding of boundaries. Teaching her that it's okay to push away when someone is violating her personal space can be a way to establish personal boundaries. But there's also the aspect of teaching non-violent conflict resolution, which is important for social development.\n\nIn terms of child safety, if the other child's actions are indeed a form of unwanted physical contact (even if not malicious), the parent is trying to ensure their daughter isn't subjected to that. The key here is whether the parent's advice is proportionate. Pushing away might be seen as a reasonable, non-aggressive way to stop the contact without causing harm.\n\nHowever, at 4 years old, the child might not fully understand the difference between defensive actions and initiating violence. The parent does mention they are strict about violence otherwise, so it's context-specific. But the spouse's worry is about the child learning that violence is acceptable in any form, even if it's justified.\n\nIn summary, the parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself in a situation where the teachers aren't intervening effectively. The spouse prefers the non-violent approach. Depending on the culture and specific circumstances, both sides can have valid points. The parent's approach might be seen as empowering the child, while the spouse's approach emphasizes non-violence and trust in adults. The answer depends on whether the parent's advice is seen as appropriate self-defense or as promoting violence."
