Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging/kissing her too forcefully. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is being overly physical, not respecting boundaries, and the daycare teachers aren't handling it effectively. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense or boundary-setting. \n\nAt 4 years old, children are still learning social skills and how to handle conflicts. The parent's advice is about protecting herself when someone won't stop despite her verbal protests. The parent emphasizes using \"legit force,\" not aggression. The partner is concerned about encouraging violence, but the parent is differentiating between self-defense and unprovoked aggression.\n\nI should think about child development. At this age, kids might not always understand personal space, but the parent is helping their daughter recognize when she's uncomfortable and how to respond. However, there's a balance between teaching self-defense and encouraging violent behavior. The key here is that the parent is teaching the child to protect herself against unwanted physical contact, which is a valid safety measure.\n\nAlso, the daycare's role is important. The parent mentions the teachers aren't seeing the issue, so the child can't rely on adults there. Teaching the child to protect herself when adults aren't available makes sense. But maybe the parent should also reinforce reporting to teachers each time, even if it's not working, as part of a multi-step approach.\n\nAnother angle: teaching a child to push back might escalate the situation. However, the parent is offering alternatives like running away and telling an adult. So it's not just about physical retaliation but options. The parent is also being clear about when it's okay to use force\u2014when someone is hurting her and not stopping.\n\nThe partner's concern is about promoting violence. But the parent is differentiating between violence and self-defense. The daughter is being taught to defend herself in a specific context where she's a victim of unwanted contact. Since the other child isn't respecting her verbal no's, the parent is giving her tools to protect herself physically as a last resort.\n\nIn terms of child psychology, giving a child agency in their own safety can be empowering. However, there's a risk of normalizing physical responses. But in this case, the parent is doing it to teach boundaries and self-protection, not aggression.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong because they're helping their child understand and enforce personal boundaries in a situation where authority figures aren't effective. The approach is about immediate self-protection rather than encouraging violence. So the answer should be B.\n"
