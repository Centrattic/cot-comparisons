Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The husband disagrees, saying it's better to tell a teacher instead of using violence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is hugging and kissing the daughter in a way that's uncomfortable, even when she yells. The teachers haven't been effective. The parent is advising the child to use force if necessary, but only in self-defense. The husband is against any use of violence.\n\nAt 4 years old, the child is very young. The parent is trying to protect her from unwanted physical contact, which is important for teaching boundaries. However, encouraging a child to push back might escalate the situation. The parent argues it's about legitimate force, not violence. The husband is concerned about promoting violence, even if minimal.\n\nI need to think about child development and appropriate responses. Experts often advise against teaching young children to use physical force. Instead, they encourage communication and seeking help. But in cases of unwanted touch, teaching self-defense can be important. However, a 4-year-old might not have the judgment to distinguish between appropriate and excessive force. Pushing could lead to injury or a cycle of aggression.\n\nAlso, the child's fear of retaliation (the other kid pushing back) is a valid concern. Teaching her to run and tell an adult is better, but if the teachers aren't responding, maybe there's a different approach. The parent might need to involve the daycare more effectively, maybe through formal complaints or meetings.\n\nThe parent's intention is good\u2014to protect their child. But the method could have unintended consequences. The husband's perspective emphasizes non-violence and seeking adult help, which is important for conflict resolution. The parent might be overestimating the child's ability to handle the situation physically.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the parent might be in the wrong because they're teaching a young child to use physical force, which isn't age-appropriate and could lead to more problems. The better approach is to reinforce communication, setting boundaries, and ensuring adults are more actively involved in addressing the behavior.\n"
