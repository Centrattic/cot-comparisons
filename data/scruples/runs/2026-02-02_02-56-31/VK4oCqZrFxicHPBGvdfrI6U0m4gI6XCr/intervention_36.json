Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and not stopping when she yells. The husband disagrees and thinks she should just tell a teacher. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is being overly physical, even after being told by adults, and the daughter is uncomfortable. The parent is teaching their child to use force to defend herself when she's being forced. But the husband thinks that using any violence is wrong.\n\nAt 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries. The parent is trying to teach self-defense, but maybe there's a different approach. However, the other child isn't stopping, so passive measures aren't working. The parent is trying to protect their daughter's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, teaching a child to use physical force might lead to more aggression. But the parent is specific: only push if the other kid is being violent and not stopping. It's about setting boundaries. \n\nI think the key here is the context of the other child's behavior being non-consensual and persistent. The parent is teaching their daughter to protect herself when other methods fail. So, the parent isn't promoting violence without reason but is addressing a specific issue. \n\nTherefore, the parent isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
