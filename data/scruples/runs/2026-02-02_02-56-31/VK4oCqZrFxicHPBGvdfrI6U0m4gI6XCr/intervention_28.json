Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's being too aggressive with hugs and kisses. They had a disagreement with their spouse about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. A 4-year-old is still very young, so their ability to understand and act on such advice might be limited. The parent says the kid is being violent, like hugging too hard and not stopping when told. The daughter has already informed the teachers, but the behavior continues because the teachers don't see it happen often. \n\nThe parent's approach is about self-defense, telling the child to push back or run and tell an adult. The spouse argues that teaching violence is bad, even in self-defense. But the parent emphasizes using \"legit force\" and they generally don't encourage violence otherwise. \n\nI should think about child psychology and development. At 4, children might not fully grasp the concept of boundaries or appropriate responses to unwanted physical contact. The advice to push back could be seen as teaching aggression, which might not be the best method. However, the situation involves another child being forceful and not respecting the daughter's wishes, which is a form of bullying or inappropriate behavior.\n\nThere's also the aspect of empowering the child to stand up for herself. Maybe the parent is trying to help her feel safe by giving her a way to react immediately since the teachers aren't catching it. But is it appropriate to tell a 4-year-old to push someone? It could lead to the child being labeled as aggressive herself, or escalate the conflict. \n\nSchool policies usually advise against children using physical force unless it's to protect themselves from harm. Helicopter parents might not be handling their child's behavior, so the daycare might need to address it more proactively. Maybe the parent should have worked more with the daycare to find a solution, like specific strategies or documenting the incidents better. \n\nHowever, the parent's intent was to protect their child from discomfort and potential harm. The spouse's concern is valid because teaching a child to use physical force could set a problematic precedent. But the parent is distinguishing between legitimate self-defense and unprovoked violence, which is a nuanced approach. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the parent's actions are well-meaning but could be seen as overstepping by encouraging physical response. The spouse is right to question the use of violence, even if it's a defensive measure. The better approach might be to reinforce non-violent methods, like using their voice more effectively or moving away, and ensuring the daycare is more vigilant. So the parent might be in the wrong for the advice given, even with good intentions.\n"
