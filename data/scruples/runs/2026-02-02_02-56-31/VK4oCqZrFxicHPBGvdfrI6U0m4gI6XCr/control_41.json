Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The parents are arguing about this. The daughter was told to use force if the other kid won't stop after she tells him to. The spouse thinks she should rely on the teachers and not use violence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old is very young, and their understanding of boundaries and conflict resolution is still developing. The other child is also 4, so both are at an age where play behavior can sometimes be aggressive or not understood as it's meant.\n\nThe main issue is the parent advising their daughter to push back if she's uncomfortable. The parent argues it's \"legitimate violence\" to defend herself when the other child is being forceful. The spouse is against using any form of violence and insists on reporting to teachers.\n\nI should think about child development guidelines. At 4, children are typically taught to use words, tell a teacher, and not to hit or push. Introducing the idea of using physical force might escalate conflicts and could be seen as endorsing aggression, even if it's for self-defense. Also, the parent's instructions might not be age-appropriate because a 4-year-old might not distinguish between appropriate self-defense and starting a fight. \n\nThe daycare's role is important. If the teachers haven't been effective in addressing the behavior, the parents might need to talk to the daycare more directly or seek alternative solutions. The parent's approach might undermine the daycare's authority and lead to more problems. \n\nAlso, the other child's parents being helicopter parents could mean the child isn't getting the right guidance, which is a separate issue. But the main question is whether the parent's advice to the daughter is wrong. \n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, teaching a child to use physical force could be problematic. It's generally advised that young children avoid physical retaliation and instead use verbal communication and seek adult help. The parent's reasoning is about self-defense, but at such a young age, the line between defense and aggression is very thin. \n\nConsidering all that, the parent might be in the wrong because they're teaching a 4-year-old to respond with force, which could lead to more harm or conflict. The spouse's approach of relying on adults to intervene is more in line with standard child-rearing advice for that age group.\n"
