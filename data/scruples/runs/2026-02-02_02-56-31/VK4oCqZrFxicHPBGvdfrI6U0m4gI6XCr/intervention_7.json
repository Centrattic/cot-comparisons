Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her in a way she finds uncomfortable. The parent encouraged the child to use force if the other kid doesn't stop, and even suggested pushing back or running away if necessary. The spouse disagrees, thinking they should stick to teaching non-violence and reporting to teachers instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. A 4-year-old is very young, and the other child's behavior involves forceful hugs and kisses that the daughter doesn't want. The daughter has tried telling the teachers, but it hasn't stopped. The parent is advising their daughter to use physical force to defend herself when the other kid is being aggressive. \n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to protect themselves from unwanted physical contact seems important. It's about respecting boundaries and personal space. If the other child is being aggressive and not responding to verbal cues, maybe some form of self-defense is justified to stop the unwanted contact. The parent wants their daughter to understand that it's okay to defend herself when someone is being violent.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse is concerned about encouraging violence. The argument here is that even in self-defense, a child might escalate the situation or not have the judgment to differentiate between appropriate and excessive force. Also, there's the perspective that relying on adults to resolve the issue is safer and teaches conflict resolution through non-violent means. At 4 years old, the child might not fully grasp the social consequences of pushing someone, and the daycare teachers might have their hands full managing multiple kids.\n\nI should also think about the age. Four-year-olds are still learning how to handle their emotions and interactions. Maybe the parent's approach is too advanced for the child's maturity level. The spouse's suggestion to report to teachers is standard in many settings, aiming to prevent physical altercations among kids. However, if the teachers aren't effective, the parent's approach might be a practical solution.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of consent and bodily autonomy. Teaching a child that she can say no and enforce that if needed is important. But there's also the risk that a child might act impulsively. The parent is trying to teach the daughter to recognize when to protect herself, but the spouse is worried about normalizing violence.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might say it's necessary to teach self-defense, especially if the child is in danger. Others might argue that preschoolers shouldn't be taught to use force, as it could lead to more aggression among peers. The daycare's role in handling such situations is also a factor. If the teachers aren't effective, maybe the parent should focus on working with the daycare to find a solution rather than instructing the child to handle it herself.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the parent's intention is to protect their daughter from unwanted contact and teach her to set boundaries. The spouse's concern is about promoting non-violence and relying on authority figures. The key is whether the approach is appropriate for a 4-year-old. Since the parent is specific about using force only when the other child is being aggressive, maybe it's justified. However, given the child's age, the spouse's perspective might be more about maintaining non-violence and preventing the child from learning that physical actions are a primary solution.\n\nI think both have valid points. The parent is trying to protect their child's autonomy, while the spouse is concerned about the child's maturity. But considering the child's age and the typical approach in such settings, maybe the spouse is right in suggesting that non-violence is better taught through communication and reporting, not physical force. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for advising physical confrontation at such a young age.\n"
