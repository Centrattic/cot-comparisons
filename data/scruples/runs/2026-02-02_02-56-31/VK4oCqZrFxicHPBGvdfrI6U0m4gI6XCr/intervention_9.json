Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her forcefully. The situation is that the other child's hugs are causing discomfort, and the teachers aren't effective in stopping it. The parent advised their daughter to push back if the other kid won't stop.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is really young, and their understanding of boundaries and social interactions is still developing. The kid in question is using forceful hugs and kisses, which the daughter finds uncomfortable. The parent's advice is about self-defense, teaching the child to set boundaries.\n\nThe other parent (SO) thinks the daughter should only tell a teacher and avoid using any violence. The parent argues that it's legitimate force in a situation where harm is occurring and that the child can differentiate between necessary defense and unnecessary aggression.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Child safety, teaching self-advocacy vs. encouraging violence, the appropriateness of a 4-year-old understanding and executing such a response, the school's role in handling the other child's behavior, and the potential for escalation if the child pushes back.\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to assert their boundaries is important. If the other child is being aggressive, the daughter has the right to feel safe, and knowing how to protect herself could be necessary. On the other hand, for a 4-year-old, physical pushing might not be the most effective or appropriate response. They might not handle it correctly, leading to more conflict. Also, the school's responsibility in managing such behavior should be emphasized. Maybe the parent should focus on ensuring the school addresses the issue more effectively, rather than teaching the child to handle it herself.\n\nAnother point is the difference between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence. It's about the intent. If the parent is teaching the daughter to recognize when she's being hurt and how to stop it, that's part of self-advocacy. But if the instruction is too direct about using physical force, it might be seen as promoting violence.\n\nAlso, the daughter's safety is the priority. If the other child might retaliate, then the advice to push back and run away might not be safe. The parent's advice includes running away and telling an adult, which is good, but the initial instruction to push might not be the best for a 4-year-old to handle in that moment.\n\nI think there's a balance here. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself, which is important, but maybe there are better ways to handle it. At 4, the child might not have the emotional or physical maturity to manage pushing back without escalating things. The school needs to be more proactive. The parent's approach is well-intentioned but possibly not the most age-appropriate. So maybe the parent is partly in the wrong because they're relying on the child's ability to handle it rather than ensuring the school intervenes more effectively.\n"
