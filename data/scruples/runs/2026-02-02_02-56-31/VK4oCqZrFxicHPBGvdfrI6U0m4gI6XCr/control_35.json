Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her in a way that's uncomfortable. The parent argues that the child has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The spouse is upset that the parent is encouraging the child to use force.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. She's 4 years old, which is pretty young. The parent is teaching her to push back if someone is being too forceful. The key here is whether that's appropriate. On one hand, teaching a child to protect themselves is important. But on the other hand, physical retaliation might escalate the situation or teach aggression. \n\nThe other kid is 4 as well, so maybe he's not aware of boundaries. The parent says the child is being physically forced, which could be a form of unwanted contact. The parent's advice includes pushing back or running to an adult. The spouse thinks telling a teacher is better. \n\nIn child development, it's common to teach kids to use their words and seek help. Parents often discourage physical responses to avoid promoting violence. However, in cases of persistent, unwanted physical contact that's making the child uncomfortable, especially when adults aren't addressing it, some might argue the child needs a way to defend themselves.\n\nBut there's a line between self-defense and starting a fight. The parent is emphasizing \"legit force,\" which is reasonable in the sense of stopping an immediate threat. However, a 4-year-old might not have the judgment to discern when to stop, leading to potential escalation. The spouse's concern is valid because teaching to use violence could lead to more aggressive behavior in general. \n\nAlso, the daycare's role is to manage such situations. If the teachers aren't seeing it, maybe the parent should be more involved in resolving it through the daycare rather than teaching the child to act on her own. But if the daycare isn't effective, the parent's approach might be a reaction to that failure.\n\nSo, the parent's intention is to protect their child from being harmed, which is understandable. However, the method of using physical force might not be the best approach. There could be alternative strategies, like role-playing the child saying \"no\" or using a firm voice, rather than physically pushing. The parent's advice might be seen as in the wrong because it encourages a physical response that could lead to more conflict or teaching aggression. Alternatively, it's in the right because the child needs immediate protection when adults aren't able to help.\n\nI think it's a balance. The parent's concern is valid, but the method might not be the best. So maybe the answer is A (the parent is in the wrong) because teaching a 4-year-old to push back might not be the appropriate solution. The spouse is right to be concerned about promoting violence. Instead of pushing, other non-violent methods should be explored first. Therefore, the parent's approach is flawed, even though their intention is good.\n"
