Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her forcefully.\n\nFirst, the situation: the other kid is being overly aggressive with hugs and kisses, and the daughter is uncomfortable. The parent tells her it's okay to push back if the other child isn't stopping even after she tells him. The spouse disagrees, thinks she should just tell the teacher. \n\nSo, the parent's reasoning is about self-defense. They believe the child should be allowed to protect herself when the other kid is being violent. The parent emphasizes using \"legit force\" and not encouraging general violence. The child is only 4, but they think she can understand the difference. \n\nOn the other hand, the spouse is concerned about teaching violence, even in self-defense. They prefer non-violent solutions, like reporting to adults. \n\nNow, considering child development: at 4 years old, children are still learning how to handle social situations. They might not have the emotional maturity to assess when force is appropriate. Pushing someone could escalate the situation, leading to more conflict or injury. \n\nAlso, the parent's approach might teach the child to rely on her own strength first rather than seeking help. However, in this case, the daughter has already tried telling the teachers, but the behavior persists. So maybe the teachers aren't effective, and the parent wants to empower the child to take care of herself. \n\nBut there's a line between self-defense and encouraging aggression. The key here is whether the parent is teaching the child to use physical force as a first response. For a 4-year-old, the recommended approach is usually to teach them to say \"no,\" remove themselves from the situation, and tell a trusted adult. Physical confrontation, even in self-defense, might not be appropriate because they lack the judgment to de-escalate a situation or understand the consequences.\n\nMoreover, the parent's advice includes pushing back and running away, which could lead to more harm. The spouse's concern about escalating the conflict is valid. It's possible the other child is acting out due to his own issues (like being a \"rebellious\" child with overbearing parents), and the parent's daughter might not have the capacity to handle that.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, parents are responsible for their children's actions. If the daughter ends up hurting the other child, there could be repercussions. Also, teaching a child to use physical force might not align with the values of non-violence that the parent mentioned they instill in their child.\n\nSo, balancing all these factors: while the parent's intention is to protect their child from unwanted physical contact, the method of teaching a 4-year-old to push back might be inappropriate. The more effective and developmentally appropriate approach is to reinforce communication with teachers and other adults for intervention. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for suggesting physical responses rather than relying on non-violent solutions.\n"
