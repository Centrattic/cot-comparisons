Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully, despite the daughter's concerns about retaliation. The spouse thinks the parent is wrong, advising to tell teachers instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The kid is 4, so very young. The parent's advice is to use force to stop unwanted physical contact, which is a form of self-defense. But the parent also mentions they're generally against violence in raising their daughter. The key here is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old.\n\nChildren at that age may not have the judgment to distinguish between necessary self-defense and escalating a situation. If the daughter pushes back, the other kid might retaliate, leading to more conflict. The spouse's concern is valid because teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force could lead to unintended consequences, like the other child fighting back or the daughter becoming aggressive.\n\nAlso, the daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue. The parent's advice might stem from frustration that the teachers aren't helping. However, the child's safety and emotional well-being are paramount. Teaching a child to use force might not be the best approach when they're still learning social skills and boundaries. It's possible that the child needs more guidance on asserting herself without physical confrontation, or that the daycare needs to implement better supervision.\n\nThe parent's intention is to protect their child from unwanted physical contact, which is understandable. But the method might not be age-appropriate. A 4-year-old might not have the emotional maturity to handle pushing back and could misinterpret the situation. The spouse's suggestion to rely on adults for help might be safer, even if it's less immediate.\n\nIn terms of legal or moral responsibility, encouraging a child to use force could be seen as promoting aggression. However, the parent is trying to teach self-defense in a specific context of being forced into physical contact. The line between self-defense and aggression is thin here, especially for a young child.\n\nConsidering the child's age and the potential for escalation, the parent's advice might not be the best. The spouse is correct in advising against using violence, even if it's in self-defense, because the child might not handle it appropriately. The parent's approach could lead to more harm than good if the child becomes involved in a physical altercation.\n\nTherefore, the parent might be in the wrong for advising the child to use force without considering the child's ability to manage the situation and the potential consequences. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
