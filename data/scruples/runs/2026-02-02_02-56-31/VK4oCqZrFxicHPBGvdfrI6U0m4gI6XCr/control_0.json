Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent's reasoning is that if someone is hurting their daughter and not stopping when she asks, it's okay to use force to protect herself. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to go to the teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old is very young, and their ability to understand and use force appropriately might be limited. The parent is teaching the child to assert herself, which is a good thing. But is encouraging physical force the right approach here?\n\nThe situation involves a child who is being hugged and kissed in a way that's uncomfortable, even when the child yells for the other to stop. The parent is addressing this by saying it's okay to push back or run and tell an adult. The spouse is concerned about teaching violence, even if it's in self-defense. \n\nI should think about child safety and consent. The daughter is being subjected to unwanted physical contact, which is a form of violence. Teaching her that she can use force to remove herself from such a situation is important for her safety. However, the alternative is to rely on adults, which the daycare teachers haven't been effective in stopping the behavior. \n\nBut, there's also a need to consider the context. At 4 years old, the child's motor skills and judgment might not be fully developed. The parent is giving a directive that could lead to physical altercations, which might escalate. The spouse's point about non-violence is valid, but if the other child isn't responsive to verbal\u5236\u6b62, then non-violent options may be limited. \n\nAnother angle is the long-term impact on the daughter. If she learns to use force in such situations, she might become more self-reliant in protecting her boundaries. But if she's too young, she might not know how to de-escalate or choose the right moment to use force, leading to misunderstandings or fights. \n\nAlso, the daycare's role is important. The parent's daughter has already told the teachers, but they aren't seeing it. The parent might be stepping in because they feel the daycare isn't addressing it. However, maybe there's a way to work with the daycare to find a better solution rather than instructing the child to handle it physically.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, children at that age often play rough, but forced hugs and kisses without respecting a child's \"no\" are not okay. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to assert her boundaries, which is a good value. However, the method involves physical action. \n\nThere's a balance between teaching a child to protect themselves and promoting non-violence. The parent's advice is specific to a situation where the other child is being violent, so it's about self-defense. The spouse's concern is about encouraging violence in general. The parent clarifies they aren't teaching general violence but specific self-defense.\n\nConsidering all that, the parent is trying to protect their child's well-being and autonomy. Since the daycare isn't effective, the parent is giving the child practical tools. However, there's a risk that the child might not understand the nuance and use force inappropriately. \n\nBut the key here is the difference between using necessary force to stop an immediate threat versus using violence without cause. The parent is instructing the child to respond only when the other is being violent and not stopping. So the force is a form of self-defense. \n\nIn conclusion, while promoting non-violence is generally good, the parent is not in the wrong because they're teaching their child to protect herself from unwanted physical contact, especially when the daycare isn't addressing it. The answer would be B.\n"
