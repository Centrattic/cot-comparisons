Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and even kissing her. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the other kid is being overly forceful, even after the daughter says she doesn't want it. The parents have already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The user advised their daughter to push back if the other kid doesn't stop. The spouse disagrees, thinking she should just tell a teacher and avoid violence.\n\nI need to consider child safety and appropriate responses for a 4-year-old. At that age, kids are still learning how to handle social situations. The user's approach is about self-defense, teaching the child to protect herself. But the spouse is right to be concerned about encouraging violence in general. However, the scenario is about a specific instance of forced physical contact that's making the child uncomfortable. The user is trying to empower the child to set boundaries, which is important. \n\nOn the other hand, teaching a child to use physical force might escalate the situation. Maybe there are better ways for a 4-year-old to handle it, like using words, moving away, or seeking help immediately. The user's advice includes telling an adult, which is good, but the pushback might not be the best approach because young kids can get hurt or misinterpret the action.\n\nI also need to think about the developmental stage. At 4, a child might not have the emotional control to assess when to push back and when to stop. It could lead to more conflict. The spouse's approach relies on adults to handle it, which is safer but maybe not effective if the teachers aren't seeing the issue.\n\nSo, there's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding violence. The user's intention is to protect their daughter, but the method might not be the most appropriate for a young child. Maybe a better approach is to reinforce telling a teacher immediately and using words to say \"no\" or \"stop,\" rather than physical responses. Hence, the user might be in the wrong for advising physical confrontation.\n"
