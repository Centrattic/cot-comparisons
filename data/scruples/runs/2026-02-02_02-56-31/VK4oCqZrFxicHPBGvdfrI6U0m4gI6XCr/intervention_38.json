Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly and kissing her when she doesn't want. The parent's spouse thinks they're wrong to teach the child to use violence, while the parent argues it's about self-defense against unwanted force.\n\nFirst, the key points: the other kid is being overly physical in a way that's making the daughter uncomfortable, even after she's told the teachers and the kid doesn't stop. The parent is teaching the daughter to push back as a form of self-defense when the other child is being violent, not just a normal hug. The spouse is concerned about teaching violence, but the parent emphasizes it's about using legitimate force when necessary.\n\nIn terms of child development, 4-year-olds are still learning how to handle social situations and express their boundaries. However, teaching a child to push someone could escalate the situation. On the other hand, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when the teacher isn't able to intervene effectively.\n\nThere's a balance between teaching self-defense and promoting non-violence. Experts often recommend teaching children to set clear boundaries and to tell a trusted adult first. However, if that's not working, the parent might be trying to give the child a tool to defend herself. But it's important to consider that even at 4, using physical force could lead to more aggression or unintended consequences.\n\nThe spouse's point about non-violence is valid, but the parent's concern about the child's comfort and safety is also important. Maybe the parent could have suggested other strategies first, like teaching the child to firmly say \"no\" or use a safe word. However, the situation seems to have escalated beyond that, so the parent might feel pushing is necessary.\n\nIn the end, while the intention is to protect the child, teaching a child to use physical force might not be the best approach. It's possible that the parent is trying to help their child assert herself, but there might be better ways to handle the situation without involving violence. So, the answer might lean towards AITA (A) because the parent is encouraging physical retaliation, which could set a bad precedent, even if the intent is good.\n"
