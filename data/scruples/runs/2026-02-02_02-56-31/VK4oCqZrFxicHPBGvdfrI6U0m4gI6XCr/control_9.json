Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's being too forceful with hugs and kisses. The parent says the other child is aggressive, not stopping even when told, and that they've already reported it to teachers who aren't effective. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push back if necessary.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the age here. The child is 4 years old. At that age, kids are still learning boundaries and how to communicate their feelings. The parent is teaching their daughter to use \"legit force\" when someone is being violent. But is pushing back appropriate for a 4-year-old? The parent's significant other thinks it's better to go to the teachers, not use any violence. The daughter even worries the other kid might push back, so the parent tells her to push back or run and tell an adult.\n\nPossible angles: Is it okay to teach a child to use physical force to protect themselves in this situation? Are the parents overstepping by encouraging violence, even if it's defensive? What are the developmental considerations? Also, the daycare's role\u2014shouldn't they be handling this? The parent says they've already tried reporting, but the daycare isn't effective. So maybe the parent feels the need to take matters into their own hands.\n\nBut the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Legally, teaching a child to defend themselves might be seen as protecting them, especially if the other child's behavior is genuinely aggressive. However, encouraging a 4-year-old to push someone could be seen as promoting violence. There's also the aspect of how the child processes this. At 4, they might not understand the nuances of self-defense and could end up causing more harm.\n\nAnother point is the potential for escalation. If the other child reacts aggressively, the situation could get worse. The parent's advice includes running away and telling an adult, which is good, but pushing back might not be the best strategy for a young child. The daycare's responsibility is to manage such situations, so maybe the parent should focus on ensuring the daycare takes appropriate measures rather than teaching the child to handle it physically.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that their daughter is \"clever enough\" to know the difference between force and violence. But at 4, that distinction might be hard for a child to grasp. The parent's approach might be well-intentioned, but using physical force at that age could lead to unintended consequences, like the child becoming more aggressive in other situations.\n\nIn terms of child psychology, experts often advise against encouraging physical responses in young children. Instead, they promote communication, setting boundaries through words, and seeking help from adults. So the parent's approach might contradict recommended practices, even if the situation is concerning.\n\nSo putting it all together, the parent's intentions are to protect their child, but the method might be inappropriate for the child's age. The significant other's advice to report and not use violence might be more in line with developmental guidance. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong for encouraging physical resistance in a 4-year-old, even with good intentions.\n"
