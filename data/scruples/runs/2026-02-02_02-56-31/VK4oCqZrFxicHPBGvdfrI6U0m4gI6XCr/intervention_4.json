Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being too rough, especially since the teachers aren't stopping it. The significant other disagrees, thinking they should just tell the teachers and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle situations. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense in a scenario where she's being physically uncomfortable. The other child isn't stopping even when she tells him, which is concerning. The parent is advocating for using force to stop the unwanted contact, but the SO thinks that's wrong and that they should only report it to adults.\n\nI should think about the potential consequences. If the daughter pushes back, maybe it escalates into a physical fight, which could be bad. But on the other hand, if she doesn't act, she's being subjected to uncomfortable and possibly inappropriate behavior. The daycare teachers aren't acting effectively, so the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself.\n\nThere's also the aspect of teaching violence. The parent says they're not encouraging random violence but teaching legitimate self-defense. However, with a 4-year-old, distinguishing between appropriate force and violence might be tricky. The parent is trying to give the child options: push back, run away, or tell an adult. But the SO is concerned about normalizing any form of violence, even in self-defense.\n\nFrom a child development perspective, teaching a young child to use physical force might not be the best approach. It's possible that the child might not know how to gauge the force correctly, leading to more harm. Also, the daycare might have protocols in place, so maybe the parent should work more closely with the staff to address the behavior instead of advising the child to handle it physically.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the other child's actions. Forceful hugging and kissing could be signs of a child who needs more guidance on personal space. The daycare might need to intervene more effectively, which the parent is trying to do by involving the staff. However, since the teachers aren't responding, the parent is stepping in to protect their daughter.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some contexts, teaching children to defend themselves is seen as necessary, while in others, it's discouraged to maintain peace among children. The parent's approach might be reasonable given the situation, but there's a risk of the child learning that physical retaliation is acceptable in certain situations.\n\nIn summary, the parent's intention is to protect their daughter from uncomfortable and possibly harmful interactions. However, the method of teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best solution, especially since it could lead to more conflict. The significant other's concern about avoiding violence is valid, but so is the parent's need to address the immediate issue when adults aren't responding. The right answer might depend on the balance between teaching self-defense and the potential risks involved.\n"
