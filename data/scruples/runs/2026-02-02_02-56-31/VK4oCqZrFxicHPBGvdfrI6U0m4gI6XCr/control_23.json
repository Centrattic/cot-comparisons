Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's being overly affectionate and not respecting her boundaries. The situation involves a child who hugs and kisses her too forcefully and doesn't stop even when she yells. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid is hurting her and not stopping, and even told her to push back again or run away if the other child retaliates. The spouse thinks that teaching violence is bad and that she should just tell a teacher.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, they're still learning social boundaries and how to express their feelings. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself when verbal communication isn't working. The other child's behavior could be considered a form of unwanted physical contact, which is a serious issue even for kids. The parent is teaching the daughter to use \"legit force\" in a specific context where the other child is imposing on her space and not respecting her verbal cues.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse is concerned about the use of any violent response, even as a defense. There's also the aspect of how daycare handles such situations. The teachers aren't seeing it happen, so the daughter can't rely on adults to intervene. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself in the moment.\n\nBut teaching a 4-year-old to push back might have unintended consequences. The other child might retaliate, leading to more conflict. The parent's advice is about using force as a last resort when all other options (telling the other child, telling a teacher) have failed. However, the child is still very young, and the parent is giving her specific instructions that involve physical confrontation, which could be seen as promoting violence even in self-defense.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of consent and boundaries. The daughter is being taught that she can assert her boundaries physically when others don't respect her verbal ones. This could be seen as teaching her a necessary skill to protect herself, but it's also a matter of how much physical force is appropriate for a 4-year-old. There's a risk that the child might overuse the advice or apply it inappropriately, leading to more aggressive behavior.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent's approach is justified. If the other child's behavior is truly non-consensual and persistent despite the daughter's attempts to stop it, then teaching her to physically push back could be a way to enforce her boundaries. However, if the parent is normalizing violence as a solution, even in specific contexts, it might set a problematic precedent. The spouse's argument is about avoiding violence at all costs and relying on adults for resolution, which is a different approach.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and child-rearing practices, there's a debate about when and how to teach children to use physical force. Some might argue that a 4-year-old isn't mature enough to distinguish between necessary force and aggression. Others might support the parent's approach as teaching self-advocacy. The daycare's role is also important; if they're not addressing the issue, the parent is filling a gap, but that doesn't necessarily justify teaching physical responses.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? If the parent is teaching the child to protect herself when all other options are exhausted and the situation is non-consensual, then maybe not. But if they're promoting physical conflict as a primary solution, that could be problematic. The answer hinges on the balance between teaching necessary self-protection and encouraging violent behavior. Given that the parent specified \"legit violence\" and the context is about non-consensual contact, the intent seems protective. However, the spouse's concern about avoiding violence is valid as well. The daycare's responsibility is another factor, but the parent is trying to empower their child. I think the parent is not in the wrong because they're addressing a specific issue where the child isn't being heard, and the approach is limited to defense. But there's a gray area here. The answer might lean towards B (No), but I need to be careful. Let me check again. The parent is not teaching general violence but specific defense in a situation where the other child isn't respecting boundaries. The spouse's approach is to rely on adults, but if that's not working, then the parent's method might be justified. So, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
