Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for telling their four-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The daughter had already told the teachers, but it didn't stop. The parent advises using force if the other kid won't stop and even suggests pushing back or running to an adult. The spouse thinks they should have just told the teachers and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is pretty young. Are they old enough to understand the concept of appropriate boundaries and how to handle them? The parent is teaching their daughter to use force when she's being uncomfortable, but the spouse is concerned about encouraging violence. \n\nOn one hand, the situation is about personal boundaries. The other child is being aggressive, possibly even abusive with the hugging and kissing. The daughter is being taught to protect herself. But at four, can a child really assess when to use force appropriately without escalating the situation? The parent mentions that they usually discourage violence but in this case, it's \"legit\" because the other kid is being violent. \n\nHowever, the spouse's concern is valid. Teaching a four-year-old to push back might not be the best approach. Kids at that age may not have the emotional maturity to respond in a controlled way. It could lead to more aggressive behavior, even if unintended. Also, the daycare staff's role is to handle such situations. The parent says the teachers aren't seeing it, but maybe there's a need to escalate the issue more, like talking to the other child's parents or involving child protective services if it's severe.\n\nAnother angle: consent and bodily autonomy. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to respect her own boundaries, which is important. However, the method of teaching her to push back might not be the safest approach. Maybe alternative strategies, like reinforcing verbal communication or creating a safe word, could be better for this age.\n\nThere's also the aspect of how the spouse reacts. The parent is trying to protect their child, which is natural, but the method might be seen as promoting violence. The spouse's alternative approach is more about reporting and not using force, which could be seen as more in line with social norms for handling such situations in daycare settings.\n\nSo, the parent's intention is good, but the approach might be questionable. The key issue is whether teaching a four-year-old to use force is appropriate. There's a balance between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression. The spouse's concern is about the child learning to use violence, which could have unintended consequences. At the same time, the parent is trying to protect their child from unwanted physical contact.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's concern for their daughter's safety is valid, the approach of encouraging a four-year-old to use force might be too much. Alternative strategies might be more effective and safer. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for the method used, even if the intention was good. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
