Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're at fault for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too violently. The husband disagrees, saying she should rely on teachers instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is hugging and kissing her in a way that's making her uncomfortable. She's told the teachers, but it's not working. The parent is teaching her to use force to defend herself when someone is being harmful. \n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to stand up for themselves is important. If someone is being aggressive or forceful, it's reasonable to tell them to stop. But the parent is suggesting pushing back, which could escalate the situation. The husband argues for non-violence and relying on adults. \n\nHowever, the child is already in a situation where the violence (or forceful hugs) isn't being addressed by the teachers. The parent is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself. At 4 years old, she's not expected to handle this perfectly, especially if the other child isn't stopping. \n\nBut using force, even in self-defense, might not be the best approach for a young child in a daycare setting. Teachers are supposed to intervene, so maybe the parent should focus on ensuring the daycare has proper supervision. However, the daycare isn't managing the situation effectively. \n\nThe parent is teaching the child to use appropriate force when necessary, which could be seen as reasonable self-defense. But the husband's point is valid that teaching non-violence is important. However, the parent is emphasizing that it's a last resort when other methods fail. \n\nI think the parent isn't entirely wrong. They're trying to protect their child's well-being and teach her to assert herself when others aren't listening. However, the approach might need refinement, like teaching her to seek help immediately after pushing away, rather than just pushing. So the parent isn't in the wrong, but could use a more balanced approach. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
