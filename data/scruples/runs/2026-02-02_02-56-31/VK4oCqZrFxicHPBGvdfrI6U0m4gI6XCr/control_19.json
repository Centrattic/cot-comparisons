Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The parent's partner is upset about this, arguing that the child should just tell a teacher instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is hugging and kissing the daughter in a way that's uncomfortable and sometimes even when the daughter protests. The teachers aren't seeing it and aren't effective. The parent is advising the daughter to push back if she's being forced, which is a form of self-defense. But the partner thinks teaching a child to use violence is wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are: the child is being harassed in a way that's making her uncomfortable, the teachers aren't helping, and the parent is teaching her to defend herself. The question is whether this is appropriate.\n\nIn terms of child development, 4-year-olds are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. Teaching a child to use physical force could lead to more aggression, but in this case, it's a specific defense against unwanted physical contact. The parent is emphasizing that it's okay to push away when someone is being violent and not respecting her wishes.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of teaching non-violent conflict resolution. The partner's concern is valid because encouraging physical retaliation might escalate the situation or teach the child that violence is acceptable. On the other hand, the parent's approach could be seen as protecting the child's autonomy and bodily integrity.\n\nAnother angle is the child's age. At 4, the daughter might not have the judgment to discern when to push back and when not to. The parent is trying to give her a tool to protect herself, but there's a risk she might misinterpret or overuse it.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical perspectives, teaching a child to defend themselves isn't inherently wrong, but the method matters. The parent's advice is to push back only when the other child is being violent, which is a form of self-defense. However, using force as a first response could be problematic compared to teaching other strategies like walking away and telling an adult.\n\nThe partner's argument is that the teachers should handle it, but if they're not effective, the parent might feel responsible to step in. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself, which is a valid concern. However, the long-term effects of teaching a child to use physical force versus non-violent solutions could influence the answer.\n\nIn summary, there's a balance between teaching self-defense and promoting non-violent conflict resolution. The parent's approach might be seen as necessary in the immediate context, but the partner's concern about encouraging violence is also valid. The correctness of the parent's actions depends on the context and the intention behind the advice. Since the parent is focusing on situations where the other child is being violent and not respecting boundaries, it could be justified as self-defense. However, the partner's worry about promoting aggression is a valid counterpoint. The answer might be a mix of both perspectives, but in the context of the question, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong.\n"
