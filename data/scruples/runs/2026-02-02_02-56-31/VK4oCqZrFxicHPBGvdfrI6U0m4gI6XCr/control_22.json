Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard. The parent's partner disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers instead of using violence. \n\nFirst, the situation involves a child who's experiencing uncomfortable physical contact from another kid. The child has already told the teachers, but the teachers aren't able to stop it. The parent is advising their daughter to use physical force if the other child won't stop. \n\nI need to consider child development here. A 4-year-old is very young and might not fully understand how to use force appropriately. Even if the parent is trying to teach her self-defense, the child might misinterpret the advice or escalate the situation. The partner's concern is valid because violence, even defensive, can teach a child that physical retaliation is acceptable.\n\nAlso, in child care settings, the standard approach is usually to teach children to use words, seek help from adults, and avoid physical conflict. Encouraging a young child to push someone might lead to more aggression, even if the initial intent was to protect. The parent's argument about \"legit force\" is understandable, but at this age, the ability to discern and respond appropriately is still developing.\n\nMoreover, the other child's behavior might need to be addressed by the daycare more thoroughly. Maybe the teachers need more specific strategies or observation to intervene effectively. The parent's approach could potentially make the other child feel targeted or escalate the conflict without adult mediation.\n\nSo, while the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, the method might not be age-appropriate and could lead to unintended consequences. The partner's stance on relying on teachers and avoiding violence is in line with standard child-rearing practices. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong here.\n"
