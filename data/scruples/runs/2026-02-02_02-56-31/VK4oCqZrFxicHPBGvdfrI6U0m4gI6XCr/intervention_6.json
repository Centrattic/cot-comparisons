Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The spouse disagrees, thinking the child should just tell the teachers and avoid any violence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4, kids are still learning how to handle social situations and boundaries. The user's approach is about teaching self-defense in a specific context where the child is being hurt. The other parent's concern is about encouraging violence in general.\n\nThe situation here is that the other child isn't stopping even when told, and the teachers are not catching it. So the user is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself in a moment when adults aren't able to intervene. The advice given is to push back if the other child is being violent, which is a form of self-defense. However, teaching a young child to use physical force could have unintended consequences, like escalating the conflict or normalizing violence.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's argument is that non-violent solutions should be prioritized. The key point is whether the user's advice is appropriate for the situation. The user didn't instruct the child to attack but to use \"legit force\" in response to direct aggression. The child might not understand the difference between self-defense and aggression, especially at 4 years old.\n\nDevelopmentally, young children might not have the judgment to distinguish between appropriate and excessive force. The user's approach might be protective, but there's a risk of the child using physical responses inappropriately. The alternative is relying on adults, but if the teachers aren't effective, the child is left without options.\n\nIt's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding violence. The user's advice is specific to a scenario where the child is being physically overwhelmed. However, teaching a child to push someone away might not be the best method. Maybe other strategies, like using their voice more assertively or seeking help immediately, could be better.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's intentions are to protect their child, which is understandable. But the method might be questionable. The spouse's concern about normalizing violence is valid. So, while the user's advice is situationally appropriate in intent, the execution might not be ideal for a 4-year-old's understanding. Therefore, there's a case for saying the user is partly wrong because the approach could lead to more aggressive behavior in the child, even if the intention was good.\n"
