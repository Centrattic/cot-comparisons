Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're at fault for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another child who's hugging her too hard or kissing her. The daughter has already told the teachers, who haven't been effective. The parent's reasoning is that if someone is hurting her and won't stop, it's okay to push back. The spouse disagrees, saying she should only tell the teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. Teaching her to use force might not be the best approach. But the situation involves repeated unwanted physical contact that's making her uncomfortable. The parent is trying to empower her to protect herself, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, teaching a 4-year-old to push back could escalate the situation. Kids that age don't always understand consequences, and if the other child pushes back, it could lead to more conflict. The parent mentioned that they are generally against violence, so this seems like a specific case of self-defense.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's point is about non-violence and relying on adults. The teachers haven't been effective, so maybe the parent's approach is a way to give the child some control. But maybe there are other non-violent options the parent could have suggested, like moving away, telling the teacher again, or using clear verbal no's.\n\nThe key here is whether teaching a child to use physical force in this context is appropriate. Since the child is so young, the parent might be overestimating her ability to handle it. Also, the parent says they explained it's only when the other child is being violent. But a 4-year-old might not discern between playful and harmful actions accurately. There's a risk of normalizing violence as a solution, even if it's in self-defense.\n\nIn terms of child development, experts often advise teaching children to say no, remove themselves from the situation, and report it. Physical retaliation isn't typically recommended unless it's immediate self-defense and the child is old enough to understand it. Since the daughter is 4, pushing back might be too advanced a concept and could lead to more harm.\n\nSo, while the parent's intention is to protect their child, the method might not be the best approach. The spouse's concern about using non-violent solutions is valid. The parent might be in the right in wanting to protect their child's autonomy but in the wrong about the method. The answer could be A, the parent is at fault, because encouraging physical retaliation at such a young age isn't developmentally appropriate.\n"
