Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging/kissing her too roughly and not stopping when she asks. The parent argues it's self-defense, while the spouse thinks she should just tell a teacher.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a young child being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's making her uncomfortable. The daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing it, so the child's parent is stepping in. The parent's advice is to use force to stop the unwanted contact if verbal cues don't work and there's no adult supervision. The spouse is concerned about encouraging violence in general.\n\nAt 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries. The parent is emphasizing self-defense (legitimate force) rather than retaliation. The child is being taught to protect herself when she's in a harmful situation. However, there's a risk that teaching a child to push someone might escalate the situation, especially with children who might not understand boundaries yet. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the other child is persistently aggressive and the daycare isn't handling it, the parent is trying to empower their daughter to take control of her own safety. The key here is whether the parent's advice is proportionate. Pushing away to stop an uncomfortable hug might be considered necessary self-defense, especially since it's not causing harm beyond stopping the immediate issue.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because teaching any form of violence can be a slippery slope, but in this case, it's about stopping unwanted contact. The parent is careful to note they aren't endorsing random violence, just self-defense. The child is old enough to understand the difference, as the parent suggests.\n\nSo, weighing it, it's about protecting the child's autonomy and safety. The parent is trying to teach her to advocate for herself when adults aren't available. While there's a risk of escalation, the alternative is the child being continually uncomfortable and possibly hurt. The daycare's inaction makes the parent's intervention more justified. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
