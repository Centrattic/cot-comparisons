Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and kissing her. The husband disagrees, saying it's better to tell a teacher and not use violence.\n\nFirst, the situation is about a child being uncomfortable with another's physical affection. The daughter has already reported it, but the teachers aren't catching it. The user's approach is to teach her to defend herself with some force if the other kid doesn't stop. The husband thinks that's wrong and prefers non-violence.\n\nI need to consider child safety and development. At 4, kids are still learning boundaries. The other child's actions could be aggressive or inappropriate, especially if he doesn't stop when told. The user is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself in a moment where help isn't immediately available. But the husband is right that escalating with violence can have consequences. However, the user emphasizes \"legit force\" to stop the invasion, not to attack. The key is self-defense versus aggression.\n\nIn many parenting guides, it's advised to teach children to set boundaries early. However, the methods can vary. Pushing back might teach a child to defend themselves, but there's a risk of starting a physical altercation. The user's approach seems measured; they mention running away and telling an adult as alternatives. It's about immediate self-protection.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's concern is valid. Introducing physical responses at a young age might normalize violence. But the user is not advocating for general violence; it's specifically in cases of unwanted contact. The daughter is aware of the rules against violence except in this specific scenario.\n\nConsidering the child's age, the parent's intention is to protect her from harm. The situation involves repeated unwanted physical contact that's distressing the child. The teachers aren't effective, so the parent is providing a practical solution. The answer might hinge on whether the method is appropriate for a 4-year-old. Some experts might support teaching self-defense in such cases, while others might prefer reinforcing non-violent communication.\n\nBut given that the child is already being affected and the other child isn't stopping, the parent is trying to give her tools to handle an immediate threat. So, I think the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
