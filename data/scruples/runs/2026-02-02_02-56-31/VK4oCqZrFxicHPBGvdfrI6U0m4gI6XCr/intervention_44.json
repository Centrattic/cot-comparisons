Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent's spouse says it's better to tell the teachers and not use any violence, but the parent argues that it's about using legitimate force when someone is being violent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from different angles. The child is being subjected to forceful hugs and kisses that she doesn't always want. The teachers aren't effectively addressing it, so the child might need a way to protect herself. At 4, she's probably not equipped to handle physical altercations, but the parent is teaching her to set boundaries. \n\nOn one hand, encouraging a child to defend herself can empower her to say no and protect her space. It's about self-defense and respecting her autonomy. On the other hand, promoting physical responses might escalate the situation or teach that violence is an acceptable solution. The spouse's concern is valid because even if the initial action is defensive, a cycle of retaliation could happen. Also, at that age, children might not have the judgment to discern when their actions are justified or how to de-escalate properly.\n\nBut then again, the parent is being specific about when to use force\u2014when the other child is being violent and not stopping despite protests. The advice includes running away and telling an adult, which are positive steps. The key is whether the parent is teaching self-defense versus uncontrolled aggression. Since it's about a clear case of unwanted physical contact that's being ignored by adults, the parent's approach seems to be about immediate safety and empowerment. \n\nHowever, there's a risk in teaching young kids that it's okay to use force, even if justified. It's a delicate balance. The alternative of only relying on telling a teacher might not be effective here, as the teachers aren't catching it. The parent is trying to give their child practical tools when the system isn't working. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent might not be in the wrong because they're responding to a real issue where the child needs to protect herself, and they're giving specific, limited advice. But there's a valid point from the spouse about the potential risks of encouraging any form of violence. The answer could depend on cultural context and the specific parenting philosophy. But given the scenario, the parent's intention seems protective and appropriate, so the answer is likely B.\n"
