Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and not stopping when she yells. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the 4-year-old is being hugged and kissed by another child in daycare in a way that's uncomfortable. The kid isn't stopping even when she tells him, and the teachers aren't catching it. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push him away if he's hurting her, and even to push back or run away if he retaliates. The spouse thinks this is wrong and advises only telling the teachers instead. \n\nSo the main question is whether teaching a child to use physical force in this situation is appropriate. Let me consider the age of the child. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and conflict resolution. The parent is teaching her to use force when she's being physically forced. But is that teaching the wrong message? Maybe the spouse is right that teaching non-violence is better, but there's an element of self-defense here. The parent argues it's about \"legit violence,\" meaning defending against unwanted physical contact. \n\nBut the other side is that for a young child, using physical force could escalate the situation. The daycare teachers aren't handling it, so maybe the parent is trying to empower the child. However, teaching a child to fight back might not be the best approach, even if it's self-defense. At that age, kids might not understand the line between defense and aggressive behavior. Also, the child is already told to tell the teachers, but they aren't seeing it. The parent's advice is a backup plan. \n\nI should also think about child development. At 4, children are still learning to express their feelings and seek help. The parent is giving her a way to protect herself, but maybe the spouse is right that it's better to rely on adults to handle the situation. However, if the teachers aren't effective, the child might feel she has no other choice. The parent's approach is about self-advocacy and immediate protection. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and personal boundaries. The child is being taught that it's okay to reject unwanted physical contact, which is a good lesson. The problem arises when the other child doesn't respect boundaries, and the parent is teaching her to use force. But is that the right way to handle it? Maybe the parent is right that in a situation where the child is being physically forced, a quick push is a reasonable response to stop the contact. \n\nBut for a 4-year-old, pushing someone might not be seen as self-defense in a daycare setting. Teachers might not understand the context and could punish both kids. Also, teaching a child to use physical force might lead to more aggressive behavior in other situations. The spouse's concern is valid because it's about using non-violent methods first. \n\nHowever, the parent's argument is that the child is in an uncomfortable or even harmful situation and needs immediate tools to protect herself. The parent is also emphasizing that it's only when the other kid is being violent. So the parent is trying to teach self-defense in a specific scenario. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many would argue that children should resolve conflicts without violence, but there's also the idea that teaching self-defense is necessary. It's a bit of a balancing act. The key here is that the parent isn't encouraging random aggression but specific, immediate defense against unwanted contact. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're empowering the child to protect herself when adults aren't intervening. On the other, they're introducing the concept of using force, which might not be appropriate for her age. The spouse's point is valid, but the situation is complex. Maybe the answer is that the parent isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement, like also emphasizing telling an adult immediately after pushing away. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The parent's advice is a form of self-defense, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe they are, because they're setting a precedent for using physical force. \n\nI think the answer depends on context. The parent's intention is to protect their child, but the method might not be the best approach for a young child. However, given that the teachers aren't handling it, the parent is trying to give the child tools. Considering all factors, I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong because they're teaching self-defense in a specific, justified context. However, there's a need to balance that with teaching non-violent solutions first. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer might be B (No).\n"
