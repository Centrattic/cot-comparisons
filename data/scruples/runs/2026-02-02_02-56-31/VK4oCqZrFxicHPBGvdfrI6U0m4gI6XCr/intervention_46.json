Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her violently. The situation involves a child who's being physically forceful, and the parents are divided on the appropriate response.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the child's safety and autonomy. The daughter is experiencing unwanted physical contact, which can be distressing even for a young child. The parent is teaching her to use force to defend herself, while the spouse prefers non-violent solutions like telling a teacher. \n\nAt age four, children are still learning how to navigate social interactions and express their boundaries. It's important that the daughter understands she can say no to unwanted touch. Teaching her to push away might be a way to assert her boundaries immediately, but there's a risk that this could escalate the situation or lead to more conflict. On the other hand, relying solely on reporting to teachers might not be effective if the teachers aren't present when the incidents occur.\n\nThe parent's approach emphasizes self-defense in a specific, non-lethal way, which could help the child feel empowered. However, the spouse's concern is valid too, as teaching a child to use violence might set a precedent for solving problems through aggression. It's a balancing act between protecting the child's immediate comfort and safety versus long-term social skills and conflict resolution strategies.\n\nAnother angle is the daycare's role. The parent mentioned that the teachers aren't seeing the incidents. Maybe there's a need to escalate the issue to the daycare staff more formally, perhaps with specific examples or even documentation, to ensure the problem is addressed. But since the parent has already tried that without success, it's understandable they're looking for alternative solutions.\n\nAlso, considering the age of the children, the severity of the behavior (forceful hugging and kissing without consent) is a key factor. While it's typical for young kids to have rough interactions, the persistence and the lack of response to verbal cues from the daughter indicate that this is more than just playful behavior. The parent's advice to push back might be a necessary immediate measure until the daycare can intervene more effectively.\n\nHowever, the parent's spouse raises a valid point about the potential normalizing of violence. It's crucial to teach children non-violent conflict resolution, but in this specific case, the daughter is being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's making her uncomfortable. The parent's guidance is about defending herself in a situation where she's not safe to do so otherwise. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent is trying to protect their child's autonomy and safety, which is a parent's primary responsibility. While the spouse's approach is more about preventing the use of violence, the immediate need is to ensure the daughter can express her boundaries effectively. The parent isn't encouraging random violence but teaching a specific, necessary response to unwanted force. Therefore, the answer leans towards the parent not being in the wrong.\n"
