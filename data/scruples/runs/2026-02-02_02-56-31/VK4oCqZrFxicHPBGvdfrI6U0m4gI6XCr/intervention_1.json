Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and even kissing her when she doesn't want it. The sister is doing this even after the daughter objects. The parents have already talked to the teachers, but it's not working. So the parent is advising their daughter to use force if necessary.\n\nFirst, the kid is 4, so they're very young. The parent is trying to teach their child to protect themselves from unwelcome physical contact. The other child is being overly affectionate and not respecting boundaries, even after being told not to. The parent is saying it's okay to push back if necessary. \n\nBut the spouse thinks it's better to just tell the teachers and avoid violence. The parent argues that it's about using justified force in self-defense. The key here is whether the advice is age-appropriate. At 4, kids might not understand how to handle pushing back and could escalate the situation. Also, teaching a child to use physical force at that age might conflict with non-violent conflict resolution methods that are typically taught in early education. \n\nHowever, the parent is emphasizing that it's about protecting oneself from someone who's being aggressive. There's a balance between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence. Since the daughter has already tried telling the other kid and the teachers, maybe the parent feels it's necessary to ensure her safety. But the child's ability to assess a threat and respond appropriately might be limited. \n\nAnother angle is the cultural or societal norms. In some contexts, even a 4-year-old might be encouraged to stand up for themselves, while others emphasize non-violence. The daycare's role here is also important. If the teachers aren't handling it, maybe the parent should focus on more consistent communication with them rather than teaching the child to push back. \n\nAlso, the daughter is worried the other kid might push back, so the parent advises to push back and run to an adult. That might be a bit much for a 4-year-old to handle. The parent might be overestimating the child's ability to manage the situation. \n\nIn terms of child psychology, it's important to teach kids about personal boundaries and how to communicate them. However, physical responses might not be the best solution. Maybe there are other ways to handle it, like practicing with the child how to say \"no\" more firmly, or using other non-violent strategies. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might be in the right in wanting to protect their child but might be using an approach that's not developmentally appropriate. The spouse's concern about encouraging violence is valid. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force could lead to more aggression or confusion about when it's okay to use violence. However, the parent's intent is to protect their child from unwanted contact, which is understandable. It's a tough call, but the parent might be in the wrong because the method used (pushing) isn't the best approach for a young child's development.\n"
