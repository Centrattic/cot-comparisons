  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider their intentions. They thought it was wrong for their sister to be in a serious relationship without the boyfriend knowing about her history of abuse. The user's parents also weren't sure if he was aware, which might have influenced their decision.\n\nBut then there's the sister's perspective. She might feel that the user overstepped by sharing such personal information without her consent. The boyfriend reacted angrily, which could be due to surprise or not knowing how to handle the information. The sister cutting off the user adds to the tension.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between protecting a loved one's well-being and respecting their autonomy. The user might believe they were acting in their sister's best interest, but the method of disclosure was direct and without her permission. This could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the sister's agency in her past situation is questioned by the user. But that's a sensitive area; even if the sister's account is questionable, it's not the user's place to judge and act on that. The right approach might have been to discuss it with the sister first, ensuring she's comfortable sharing her story.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is understandable if he felt blindsided. The user didn't give the sister a chance to disclose this herself, which might be why the boyfriend was upset. The sister's response to the user cutting ties suggests deep hurt feelings, indicating that the user's actions were perceived as a violation of trust.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. While intentions might be good, the method of disclosure was problematic. The user might have been in the wrong for not consulting their sister first and for revealing private information without her consent.\n"
