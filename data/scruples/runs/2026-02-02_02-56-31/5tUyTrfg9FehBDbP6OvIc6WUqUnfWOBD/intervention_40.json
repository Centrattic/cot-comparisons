I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister who had a history of being in an abusive relationship, where her ex-boyfriend was basically her pimp. Now she's in a serious relationship with a new guy, and the person (the sister's sibling) felt the need to tell the boyfriend about her sister's past. The sister's parents thought the boyfriend might not know about this, so the sibling decided to inform him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister then cut off the sibling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The sister's past is her own history, and whether she chose to disclose it to her boyfriend is her decision. The sibling intervening and sharing that information without consent might be an issue. Privacy is a big factor here. The sister might have her reasons for not disclosing her past, maybe she's still healing or doesn't want to be judged. The sibling's action could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might have a right to know if something is a significant factor in the relationship. However, the sister's right to privacy and autonomy is also important. The sibling's intention was to be honest, but the method was without consent. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to being upset about the information or feeling that the sister didn't trust him. The sibling might argue that they were protecting their sister from potential harm if the boyfriend isn't aware and might not handle the situation well. But the way it was done, without the sister's permission, is problematic.\n\nIn many cases, family members might feel it's their role to protect their siblings, but in this context, the sister might see the disclosure as a violation. The boyfriend's anger could be a reaction to the way he found out rather than the information itself. The sister cutting off the sibling might be because of betrayal. Legally, unless there's a duty to warn (like if there's a threat of harm), the sibling isn't obligated to inform the boyfriend. Ethically, it's a gray area, but without consent, it's likely the sibling overstepped their bounds.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the person is in the wrong (A) because they disclosed private information about their sister without her consent, which is a violation of her privacy and trust.\n"
