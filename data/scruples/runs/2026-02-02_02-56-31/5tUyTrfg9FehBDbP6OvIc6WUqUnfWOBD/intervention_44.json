  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they did the right thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about her history of abuse. The sister had a past abusive relationship and is now in a serious relationship. The user mentioned this to their parents, who didn't know if the current boyfriend knew. The user then went to the boyfriend and told him, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The sister's history is private and sensitive. Sharing that information without her consent is a big deal. Even if the user is concerned about her well-being, the method of disclosure might be problematic. The user's intention was to protect the boyfriend from not knowing, but they didn't consult their sister first. That's a key point. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the sister's agency. The user is unsure if the sister had as much control as she claims in her past situation. While that might be true, the user's role here is to support their sister, not to act as a judge or informer. By telling the boyfriend, the user might have breached their sister's trust. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was negative, which is understandable because the information was shared without his consent. The user then demanded an apology from the boyfriend, which the sister rejected. Now the user is cut off from their sister. \n\nEthically, the user's main mistake was sharing personal information without the sister's consent. Even with good intentions, privacy is important. The user should have discussed their concerns with their sister first, perhaps encouraging her to talk to the boyfriend herself. \n\nHowever, there's also a concern about the sister's safety. If the boyfriend was abusive, the user might have a point, but the way the information was shared could have been handled better. The user's actions led to a breakdown in family relationships, which is a significant consequence. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's intentions might be seen as protective, but the method was invasive. So, the answer could lean towards the user being in the wrong because of the lack of consent. However, there's a nuance if the sister was in danger. But typically, without consent, sharing such information is a breach of privacy. So the answer is likely A.\n"
