I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend the truth about the sister's past. The sister had a bad experience with an abusive ex who was like a pimp. The author commented to their parents that it's good the boyfriend is with her despite her history. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew about her past. The author then went to the boyfriend and told him, leading to a confrontation where the boyfriend yelled and threw them out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of sharing someone else's private information. The author's sister might have kept her past a secret for a reason\u2014maybe she felt ready to share it when she was ready, or maybe she didn't want her new partner to know. The author stepped in without consulting the sister, which could be seen as overstepping. Even if the author's intentions were to protect their sister by ensuring the boyfriend was aware of her history, that doesn't necessarily make it right. People have the right to privacy, and family members can't always decide what's best for others.\n\nAlso, the author's judgment about their sister's agency in the past situation might be clouding their perception. They mentioned they're unsure if the sister had as little agency as she claims. But even if that's the case, the author's role in exposing that information without consent is questionable. The boyfriend's reaction, while aggressive, might indicate that the timing or the way the information was shared was unwise.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been concerned about their sister's well-being, thinking the boyfriend should know about her history so he could make an informed decision. However, the appropriate approach would have been to talk to the sister first and let her decide whether to disclose her past to the boyfriend. By going directly to the boyfriend, the author bypassed the sister's autonomy, which could be a significant breach of trust.\n\nThe sister's response cutting off the author is a consequence of the author's actions. If the author had approached the sister first and expressed their concerns, maybe the outcome would have been different. Instead, the author's decision to act unilaterally led to a fallout with both the sister and the boyfriend.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions likely overstepped their bounds. They had a right to be concerned, but the method of addressing it was problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
