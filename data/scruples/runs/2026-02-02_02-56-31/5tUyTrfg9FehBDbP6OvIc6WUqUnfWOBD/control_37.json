I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about their sister's history of being abused by a previous partner. The sister had been with this boyfriend for over a year, and they were considering marriage. The author's parents mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew about the past, and the author decided to tell him directly. The boyfriend reacted negatively, yelling and throwing the author out, and then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to share that information. The sister's past is a sensitive and personal matter. Even though the author might feel concerned about their sister's well-being, sharing such information without the sister's consent could be a breach of privacy. The sister might have chosen to keep that part of her history private, either because she didn't want to burden the relationship or because she felt it wasn't relevant anymore. \n\nThe author's parents also mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, which suggests that maybe it's not their place to reveal this information. The author's intention might have been to protect their sister by ensuring the boyfriend was aware of potential issues, but that doesn't necessarily justify going behind the sister's back. \n\nAdditionally, the way the author approached the situation\u2014telling the boyfriend directly without discussing it with the sister first\u2014could be problematic. Even if the author believed the boyfriend didn't know, sharing such personal trauma without the sister's approval could be seen as overstepping. The boyfriend's reaction might have been due to the way the information was presented rather than the content itself.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's abusive past is a significant detail that could affect the relationship. If the boyfriend wasn't aware, he might not be making an informed decision about marrying her. However, the sister has the right to decide when and how to disclose her history. The author's actions might be well-intentioned but could have violated her autonomy.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they disclosed private information without consent, leading to conflict and the sister cutting them off. The right approach would have been to talk to the sister first, express concerns, and let her decide if and when to share her past with her partner.\n"
