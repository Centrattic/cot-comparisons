  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was like a pimp. The user thought it was wrong that she was hiding this from her current boyfriend. The parents mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so the user told him. The boyfriend reacted badly, and the sister is now cutting the user off.\n\nHmm, the user's actions were based on concern for their sister's well-being and the boyfriend's right to know. But maybe they overstepped by not consulting the sister first? The sister might have wanted to disclose it herself, or maybe she was ready to move on and didn't want the past to affect her current relationship. The user's intention was good, but the method might have been wrong. Did the sister agree that the information needed to be shared? If she had secrets, maybe she had a reason. The user didn't get her permission, so that's a possible issue. Also, the boyfriend's reaction could be due to being blindsided. The user might have a point about transparency, but acting without the sister's consent complicates things. It's tricky because protecting a sibling's well-being is important, but respecting her autonomy is too. So the user might be in the wrong for not discussing it with the sister first.\n"
