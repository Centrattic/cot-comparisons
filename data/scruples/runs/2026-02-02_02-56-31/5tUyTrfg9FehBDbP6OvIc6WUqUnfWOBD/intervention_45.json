I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister was in an abusive relationship, and the user thought it was wrong to keep this from the boyfriend. But when they told him, he reacted badly, and the sister cut them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's past is serious\u2014being abused and pimped. The user's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew. The user believed the sister should have been honest with him, so they took it upon themselves to inform him. \n\nBut wait, is it the user's place to do that? The sister might not want that information shared, even if it's for her benefit. The user's intention was good\u2014to protect their sister from a potentially harmful relationship if the boyfriend didn't know. However, the method of sharing such sensitive information without the sister's consent could be problematic. \n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's private information without their permission, even if it's about abuse, can be considered a breach of trust. The sister might feel that the user violated her privacy. The boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but that's his issue. The user might have thought they were doing the right thing by informing him, but they didn't consider the sister's autonomy in deciding who to tell and when.\n\nAlso, the sister's response was cutting off the user, which is extreme, but maybe the user didn't handle it the right way. There's a line between concern for a sibling and overstepping boundaries. The user might not be entirely in the wrong, but they did act without the sister's consent, which could be a significant factor. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the user had the right to share that information. If the sister hadn't told her boyfriend herself, maybe the user shouldn't have. Even with good intentions, it's about respecting her privacy and her relationship choices. The user might be in the wrong for not respecting her decision to keep that part of her history private, even if they disagreed with it.\n"
