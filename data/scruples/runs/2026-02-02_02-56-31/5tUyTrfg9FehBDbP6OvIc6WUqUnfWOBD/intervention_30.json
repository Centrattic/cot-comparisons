I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. The sister had a history of being in an abusive situation where she claims she had little agency, and the user felt that the boyfriend didn't know about it. The user approached the boyfriend directly, which led to a hostile reaction and the sister cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's right to privacy. The user's sister was the one who chose not to disclose her past to her current boyfriend. By revealing that information without her consent, the user might have violated her privacy. The sister might feel that her personal history is her own to share, and others shouldn't disclose it without permission. That could be a key point here.\n\nThen there's the user's intentions. They mentioned they were unsure if their sister actually had little agency in the past situation. This suggests the user had their own doubts about the sister's account, which might have influenced their decision to tell the boyfriend. But even if the user believed they were doing the right thing, the method of disclosure\u2014telling the boyfriend directly\u2014could be problematic. Approaching the boyfriend without discussing it with the sister first might have been a breach of trust.\n\nThe reaction from the boyfriend was negative, but the user expected a different one. The boyfriend's anger and the sister cutting off the user could indicate that the user overstepped. The user then demanded an apology from the boyfriend, which the sister refused. This shows that the sister prioritized her partner's reaction over her sibling's feelings, which might indicate that the user's actions caused a rift they didn't foresee.\n\nLegally, there might not be a clear violation, but ethically, the user's action of disclosing sensitive information without consent is questionable. The sister's consent to share her own story is crucial here. The user's lack of communication with the sister before acting could be a significant misstep. It's possible that the user wanted to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who had a traumatic past, but the way they went about it might have been disrespectful to their sister's autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is the user's own agency in the situation. They felt it was their responsibility to inform the boyfriend, but that responsibility might not exist without the sister's consent. The sister might feel that the user is overstepping their role as a sibling, especially if the user had doubts about her agency in a past relationship. This could imply some bias or judgment from the user towards the sister, which isn't healthy in a family dynamic.\n\nIn summary, while the user's intentions might have been to protect the boyfriend from a potentially harmful situation, the method and lack of consent from the sister led to negative consequences. The sister's privacy and autonomy should be respected, and the user's actions, though perhaps well-meaning, cross a line by not seeking her permission first. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for violating their sister's privacy and autonomy without considering the consequences.\n"
