I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp, which is pretty severe. The user made a comment to their parents about the boyfriend, and the parents weren't sure if he knew. The user thought it was wrong for the sister to be in a serious relationship without the boyfriend knowing this major issue.\n\nThen the user went to the boyfriend and told him the truth. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing them out. The sister then cut off the user after they asked for an apology from the boyfriend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister's past abuse, the user's intent to inform the boyfriend, the boyfriend's reaction, and the sister's response.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, the sister's past is a serious matter. The user believed the boyfriend didn't know, so they thought they were doing the right thing by informing him. However, sharing such personal information can be a breach of privacy. The sister might have chosen not to disclose that part of her history, possibly because she was trying to move on or protect herself. The user didn't check with the sister first, which might have been a mistake. \n\nBut on the other hand, the boyfriend is in a serious relationship planning marriage. The user felt it was important for him to know about the sister's past abuse to make an informed decision. However, the way the user approached it\u2014without the sister's consent\u2014could be problematic. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but maybe because he was surprised or felt blindsided. The sister's cutting off the user might be because she felt betrayed. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The user's intention was to protect the boyfriend and maybe the sister, but the method was invasive. The sister's right to privacy is important, and the user overstepped by not discussing it with her first. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the user is in the wrong (A) because they shared sensitive information without the sister's consent, which is a breach of trust. Even if the intent was good, the action violated her privacy. However, there's also the argument that the boyfriend has a right to know, but that doesn't justify bypassing the sister's agency. The sister's decision to not disclose might have been for a reason, and the user shouldn't have overridden that.\n"
