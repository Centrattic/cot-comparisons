  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they did the right thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past with abuse. The sister was involved with someone who abused her and acted like a pimp, and she's now with a new guy. The user told the boyfriend, thinking it was wrong to not know that. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut the user off.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user was in the wrong. Let's break it down. The user's intention was to protect their sister by being honest, maybe to prevent potential harm if the boyfriend wasn't aware. But sharing such sensitive information without consent can be tricky. \n\nFirst, was the user justified in sharing the information? The sister might have chosen not to tell her new partner, which could be her decision if she feels ready. By revealing it, the user might have overstepped, even with good intentions. \n\nThen, the boyfriend's reaction: he got angry and threw the user out. That could be a valid reaction if he felt betrayed by not being told by the sister. But the user didn't ask the sister's permission first, so maybe that's part of the issue. \n\nAlso, the sister's response was to cut off the user. That suggests she's upset about the breach of trust. The user's action might have caused a rift in the family. \n\nEthically, sharing someone else's private information without their consent is often considered a violation of trust. Even if the information is about a past traumatic event, the sister might have her reasons for not disclosing it to her partner. The user's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, but that doesn't mean the user had the right to inform him. \n\nOn the other hand, if the sister is in danger or the boyfriend is a risk because he doesn't know about her past, maybe there's a case for the user to act. But without knowing the full context, it's hard to say. The user's approach was direct and without consent, which could be seen as meddling.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user might have overstepped by not respecting their sister's autonomy in deciding what to share with her partner. Therefore, they could be at fault. But there's also the aspect of concern for their sister's well-being. However, the method used might have been inappropriate. So the answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong.\n"
