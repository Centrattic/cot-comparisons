I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the abusive past is in the wrong. The situation involves a family member's serious relationship and past trauma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister had a history of abuse by a previous partner, and the current boyfriend might not know. The author believes that the sister is hiding this information, which is a major red flag in a relationship. The parents also seemed unsure if the boyfriend knew, which adds to the concern.\n\nThe author's action was to confront the boyfriend directly. But did they have the right to do that? The sister might have chosen not to share her past, and the author stepping in could be seen as overstepping. However, the author might be motivated by concern for their sister's well-being, thinking the boyfriend needs to know to make an informed decision.\n\nBut there's a boundary issue here. The author isn't the one in the relationship, so maybe they shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to disclose such sensitive information without the sister's consent. The sister might have reasons for not sharing her history, even if the author disagrees. The boyfriend's reaction was defensive, but that doesn't necessarily mean he would stay in an abusive relationship. The author's approach might have been too direct and could have damaged the sister's trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's history is significant, and the current boyfriend being unaware could mean he's not making a fully informed decision. The author's intention was to protect their sister, but the method was problematic. The right approach might have been to talk to the sister first and encourage her to share her past with the boyfriend herself, rather than disclosing it themselves.\n\nSo, while the author had good intentions, the action of revealing the sister's personal history without her consent likely crossed a boundary. That makes the author potentially at fault. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
