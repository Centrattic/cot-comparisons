I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past with an abusive ex who was like a pimp. The sister was in a serious relationship, and the author felt she was hiding this major issue. The parents also thought the boyfriend might not know. The author went to the boyfriend's place and told him, leading to a confrontation where the boyfriend yelled and threw them out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to disclose that information. The sister's past is personal and could affect the relationship. But the author is the sibling, so there's a family dynamic here. The author's intention was to prevent the boyfriend from being in a relationship without full knowledge, which they thought was necessary. However, the sister might have chosen not to share that with her current partner for various reasons\u2014maybe she's healing, or maybe she didn't want to burden him. By revealing it without her consent, the author violated her privacy. Even if the author's concern was valid, the method was intrusive.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but maybe because he was surprised. The author didn't give the sister a chance to share the information herself. The sister's response of cutting off the author is harsh, but the author might have overstepped. So, the main issue is the breach of trust and privacy. Even if the intent was good, the action was unauthorized. So the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's autonomy to decide when and how to share her past.\n"
