  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their sister's boyfriend not knowing about her past abuse. The person told the boyfriend the truth, which led to a bad reaction from him and then the sister cutting them off.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused and pimped by an ex, which is a serious issue. The person thought it was wrong that she was with this new guy without telling him. But they didn't consult the sister first; they just told the boyfriend. That's a big point. Telling someone's partner something personal without the person's consent can be a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, it's about respecting boundaries.\n\nThe sister's history is her story to share, right? Unless she's endangering herself or others, it's her choice to disclose. The person might have valid concerns about the boyfriend knowing, but they didn't talk to the sister first. Instead, they took it upon themselves to inform him, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe boyfriend reacted negatively, but the person might not be responsible for his reaction. However, the method of disclosure\u2014without the sister's knowledge\u2014could have been the main issue. The sister's response of cutting them off is understandable if she felt her privacy was violated.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's autonomy in deciding whether to share her past. They acted without her consent, leading to conflict. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
