I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story did the wrong thing by telling her sister's boyfriend about her sister's past abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. That's a serious issue. The author thinks the boyfriend might not know this part of her history and feels it's wrong to be in a serious relationship without that info. The author's parents also seem unsure if he knew.\n\nThe author approached the boyfriend directly and told him. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile\u2014yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister cut off the author. So, the question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nI should think about boundaries and privacy. The sister had a traumatic experience, and sharing that information with the boyfriend might be something she should control. The author, as a family member, might feel protective, but maybe they didn't consider that the sister might not want that information shared. Even if the author's intentions were good, did they have the right to disclose such personal information without the sister's consent?\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction could be due to being shocked or upset, but the author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend before staying in the sister's life might be too much. The sister's response is extreme, but maybe she felt her privacy was violated.\n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing someone's private trauma without their permission is usually considered a breach of trust. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's privacy. However, if the sister had a duty to disclose her past to a potential spouse, maybe the author had a point, but the method was flawed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they shared confidential information without consent, even if their intentions were to protect their sister.\n"
