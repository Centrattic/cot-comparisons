  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for telling their sister's boyfriend about the abuse in their sister's past. The sister had a history of being abused, including being pimped by an ex, and the user felt she was hiding that from the current boyfriend. The user's parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so they decided to tell him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut the user off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The user's intention was to be honest, but maybe they overstepped. The sister might have chosen not to share that information for her own reasons. By revealing it, the user could have broken her trust. On the other hand, the boyfriend having that information could help him make an informed decision about the relationship. But the user didn't consult the sister first, so that's a problem. They also didn't consider if the sister wanted to disclose it herself. The way the boyfriend reacted is extreme, but the user's actions might have contributed to that. The sister's response is harsh, but the user might have crossed a boundary by not respecting her privacy. So, the user probably did something wrong by not getting her consent first. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
