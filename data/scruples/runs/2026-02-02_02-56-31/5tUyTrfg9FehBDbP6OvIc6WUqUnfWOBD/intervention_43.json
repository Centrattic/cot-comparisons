  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive ex. The sister had a history of abuse and pimping, and the person thought it was wrong to keep that from the boyfriend. They told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily, and now the sister is cutting them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister was in an abusive situation, which is serious. The person's concern might stem from wanting to protect their sister or ensure the boyfriend is aware of her history. However, sharing personal and sensitive information without consent can be a breach of privacy. Even if the person's intentions were good, they might have overstepped by not talking to the sister first. The sister might have her reasons for not disclosing that information, maybe she's not ready or the boyfriend already knows. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which could indicate he was unprepared for the news, but yelling and throwing someone out is not a healthy response. However, the person's action of revealing private information without the sister's consent might be the main issue here. The sister is now upset and has distanced herself, which complicates things. The person might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's privacy, even if they thought they were helping. Alternatively, if the sister was in danger, maybe there was a need to step in, but the approach was inappropriate. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be that the person is in the wrong (A) because they disclosed private information without consent, leading to negative consequences. But there's also nuance if the sister truly needed help. However, the question is whether the person was wrong, and without consent, sharing such details is generally problematic.\n"
