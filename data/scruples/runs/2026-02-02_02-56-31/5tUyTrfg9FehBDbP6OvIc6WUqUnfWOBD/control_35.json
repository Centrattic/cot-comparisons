I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past with abuse and being a pimp. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was a pimp. She's now in a serious relationship with a new boyfriend. The author told the boyfriend about this history because they thought it was important for him to know. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did the right thing by disclosing this information. There are a few angles here. On one hand, the author might believe they were protecting their sister by ensuring her partner knew her past. On the other hand, the sister might have chosen not to share that information with her current boyfriend, so the author could be overstepping by revealing it.\n\nI should consider consent and privacy. The sister might not have wanted her past to be shared, even if the author thought it was necessary. The author might have thought it was their duty as a sibling to protect their sister from potential harm, but others might see it as violating her privacy. Also, the boyfriend's reaction could be due to being blindsided, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right or wrong.\n\nAnother point is the sister's agency. The author mentions being unsure about how much agency their sister had in the past. Maybe they feel the boyfriend needs to know to make an informed decision. However, it's possible the sister has moved past that, and the author is projecting their doubts onto her current relationship.\n\nThe consequences are significant: the sister cut off the author, and the boyfriend was upset. The author might not have considered the sister's wishes, leading to the fallout. In many cases, respecting someone's autonomy means not disclosing personal information without their consent, unless there's a legal or safety concern. Since the author didn't mention any immediate danger, it's more about respecting the sister's choice.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, while the author's intention might have been to help, they overstepped by not discussing it with their sister first. The sister's right to privacy and control over her own narrative is important. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they shared sensitive information without consent, even if their motives were good.\n"
