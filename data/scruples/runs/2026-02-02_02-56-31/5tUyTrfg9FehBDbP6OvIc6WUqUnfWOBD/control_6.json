I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The sister was in a relationship where she claims her ex was abusive and a pimp. The author felt that it was wrong for the sister to hide this from her current boyfriend, so they revealed the information. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut the author off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and consent. Did the author have the right to share this information? The sister might have kept it a secret for her own reasons, maybe to protect her privacy or to handle it on her own timeline. By revealing it without her consent, the author might have breached her trust. That's a point against the author.\n\nBut then, the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who had such a traumatic past. Some might argue that the boyfriend had a right to know, especially since they're talking about marriage. However, the author's method of disclosure was direct and not discussed with the sister first. That could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was negative, but that could be due to shock or misunderstanding. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend might be unfair if the boyfriend was just reacting emotionally. The sister cutting off the author could be her way of defending her partner or feeling that her privacy was invaded.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between protecting someone's partner and respecting the individual's right to privacy. The author might have crossed a line by not discussing it with the sister first. Also, the sister's agency in her past situation is questioned by the author, but that might not be the author's place to judge.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the breach of trust without consent. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, sharing such sensitive information without the sister's approval is a significant problem. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
