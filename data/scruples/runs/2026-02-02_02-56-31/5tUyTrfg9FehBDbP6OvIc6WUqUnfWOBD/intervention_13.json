I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the sister had apparently kept secret from him. The sister had a history of being abused, maybe even being a pimp, and the person thought it was important for the boyfriend to know. The boyfriend reacted angrily, throwing the person out, and the sister then cut them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's past is a sensitive issue. The question is whether the person had the right to disclose that information. The sister might have chosen not to share it for various reasons\u2014maybe she's not ready, wants to move on, or there's a fear of judgment. By revealing it, the person might have violated her privacy. Even if they thought it was for the boyfriend's benefit, the sister's autonomy is important here. \n\nBut then again, if the boyfriend was in a serious relationship and didn't know something that significant, maybe the person was trying to protect him. However, that's a big assumption. The person's parents even doubted whether the boyfriend knew, so the person might have felt compelled to act. But was it their place to do so?\n\nAlso, the way the person approached it could be an issue. Confronting the boyfriend alone and not discussing it with the sister first might have been a mistake. The sister might have wanted to tell him herself, and the brother/sister intervening could have ruined the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction was intense, but maybe that's because he felt blindsided. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's past is a crucial detail. If the boyfriend had known, maybe he would have made a different decision. But the person's method of disclosure could have been mishandled. They might have been overstepping by sharing personal information without the sister's consent. \n\nSo, the key points are consent and the person's right to share. The sister's privacy is a factor here. The person's intention might have been good, but without the sister's approval, they crossed a line. The sister's choice to not disclose her past is her own decision, and the person's intervention might have been a violation of that choice. Therefore, the person might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's boundaries.\n"
