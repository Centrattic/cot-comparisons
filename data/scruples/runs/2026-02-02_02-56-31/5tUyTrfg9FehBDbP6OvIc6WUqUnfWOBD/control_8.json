I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse by a previous partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister had a history of being abused and pimped by an ex-boyfriend. The author mentioned this to their parents, and then later told the current boyfriend because they thought it was important for him to know. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did the right thing. From a moral standpoint, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be a breach of trust. However, the author's intention was to protect the sister's current boyfriend from potential harm, given the serious nature of the abuse. The sister might have kept this a secret for a reason, maybe to protect her privacy or because she felt ready to disclose it on her own terms.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction suggests that the information might have been a shock, which aligns with the parents' uncertainty about his knowledge. The author might have acted out of concern, but without the sister's permission, it's a violation of her confidentiality. The sister's response cutting off the author is a consequence of this breach, which the author might have anticipated.\n\nSo, the author's action was well-intentioned but crossed a boundary by disclosing private information. Even if the intent was good, the method was problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's autonomy to share her own history when she felt ready. The answer should be A.\n"
