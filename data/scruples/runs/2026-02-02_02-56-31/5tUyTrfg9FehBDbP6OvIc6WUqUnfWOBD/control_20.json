I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped, which is a serious issue. The author believes their sister might not be being honest about her role in that situation. They told the boyfriend because they thought it was important for him to know, given how serious the relationship is (talking marriage). \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author have the right to share this information? The sister's boyfriend was being kept in the dark about a significant part of her past that could affect the relationship. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a situation where he's unaware of potential red flags.\n\nHowever, there's a line between concern and overstepping. The author didn't consult the sister first, which could be seen as violating her privacy. Even if the author thinks the sister's account is questionable, the sister might have her reasons for not disclosing the abuse yet, perhaps to avoid stigma or because the boyfriend is supportive regardless.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which might suggest he felt betrayed or that the information was shared without consent. The author's approach was direct and confrontational, which could have been handled more sensitively. Maybe discussing it with the sister first or involving a professional would have been better.\n\nBut the situation is complex. The author's concern is valid because the boyfriend has a right to know about his partner's past, especially given the severity of the abuse. However, the method of disclosure was abrupt and didn't consider the sister's autonomy. The author might not be entirely at fault, but there's a case to be made that they overstepped by not getting permission from the sister first.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had good intentions, the way they chose to share the information without the sister's consent could be seen as wrong. So, the answer might lean towards A, but the situation isn't black and white. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering privacy and consent, the answer is likely A.\n"
