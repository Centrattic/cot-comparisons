I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their sister was in an abusive relationship, which was also pimping. The sister is now with a new guy, and the person thought it was wrong that the sister didn't tell him about her past. They told the boyfriend directly, which caused a big reaction. Now the sister is cutting them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's past is a serious matter\u2014abuse and pimping. The person's sister might not have been truthful with her new boyfriend about that. The person thought it was important for the boyfriend to know because it's a major issue that could affect the relationship. They told him, but he reacted angrily, and then the sister is upset with them.\n\nIs the person wrong for telling the truth? Well, the sister's boyfriend has a right to know about her past if it's a significant factor. However, the way it was handled might be an issue. The person didn't talk to their sister first, just went directly to the boyfriend. That could have been a problem. The sister might have wanted to tell him herself, or maybe she didn't want others involved. Also, the reaction from the boyfriend was hostile, which complicates things.\n\nBut if the sister withheld such critical information from her partner, maybe the person did the right thing by informing him. The sister might not be truthful about her agency in the past situation, which the person is unsure of. So there's a concern about the sister's well-being and the new relationship's future.\n\nHowever, the method of delivering the information might have been inappropriate. Approaching the boyfriend without discussing it with the sister first could be seen as overstepping. Even if the intention was good, the approach could have been better. Maybe the person should have talked to their sister first to understand her side and see if she was planning to tell the boyfriend herself.\n\nThe sister's response\u2014cutting off the person\u2014might be an overreaction, but it shows how hurtful the situation was. The boyfriend's anger could be from being blindsided or from not knowing how to process the information. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between protecting a loved one's partner from potential issues and respecting the sister's privacy and autonomy. The person might have thought they were helping, but they might not have considered the sister's wishes or the appropriate way to handle it.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe there's a mix of right and wrong here. The intention was to do the right thing, but the method could have been better. The person might be in the wrong for not consulting their sister first and for directly confronting the boyfriend without her knowledge. However, if the sister was indeed hiding something harmful, the person had good intentions. But in terms of respecting boundaries, maybe they did cross a line. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they acted without considering the sister's wishes and the proper way to handle the situation.\n"
