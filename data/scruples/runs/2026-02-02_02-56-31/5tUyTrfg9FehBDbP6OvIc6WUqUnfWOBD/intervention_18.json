I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was abusive and even acted like a pimp. She came back to live with the parents, and now she's dating someone new for over a year, serious enough to talk about marriage. The user mentioned to their parents that it's good the new guy is with her despite knowing her history. The parents weren't sure if he knew, so the user went to the boyfriend and told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the user.\n\nThe user's reasoning was that it's wrong for the sister to be in a serious relationship without the boyfriend knowing about her past. They felt it was important for him to know because it's a major issue that might affect the relationship. But the boyfriend reacted negatively, and the sister is upset because her boyfriend yelled at the user.\n\nNow, to determine if the user is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nConfidentiality is a big factor here. The sister might have shared her history with her family, but does the user have the right to disclose that to her boyfriend? Even if the user believes it's in the sister's best interest, sharing such personal information without consent can be a breach of trust. The sister might have chosen not to tell her boyfriend for her own reasons, maybe to protect herself or because she's working through things. The user's action could be seen as overstepping their role as a sibling, especially if the sister didn't give permission for that information to be shared.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's intention was to be honest and protect their sister from potential harm. If the boyfriend was unaware of her past, the user might think that he's not making an informed decision by staying in the relationship. However, there's a difference between wanting to protect someone and violating their privacy. The sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her past is important. By revealing the information, the user might have undermined her agency.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be due to being shocked or upset, not necessarily because of the user's character. Yelling and throwing the user out might indicate his emotional response rather than the user's actions being inherently wrong. However, the user's method of disclosure might have been abrupt and without considering the sister's consent or the boyfriend's readiness to handle the information.\n\nThe sister cutting off the user is a consequence of the user's action, which might indicate that the user's approach caused significant harm to their relationship. Even if the intention was good, the action might have been taken without fully considering the sister's wishes and the potential fallout.\n\nIn ethical terms, there's a balance between honesty and respecting others' boundaries. The user might have thought they were being truthful, but they didn't have the sister's permission to share her history. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for violating confidentiality, even with good intentions. However, if the sister's well-being is at stake, some might argue the user acted out of concern. But typically, personal information is the individual's to share, and others shouldn't disclose it without consent unless there's a legal obligation, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user likely overstepped by sharing their sister's private information without her consent, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, the answer might be A (They are in the wrong). But there's nuance because the intention was to protect the sister. However, the method was flawed, making the user at fault.\n"
