  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the scenario is that the user told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner who was like a pimp, and now she's in a serious relationship with someone new. The user thought it was important for the boyfriend to know because they felt the sister was hiding something major. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing them out. The sister then cut off the user.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's intent. They believed that the boyfriend should know about the sister's past because it's a significant issue that could affect the relationship. The user's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so maybe the user felt a responsibility to inform him. But the sister didn't want that information shared, leading to the fallout.\n\nKey points to consider: Did the user have the right to share this information? The sister's confidentiality and consent are important. Even if the user thought it was for the sister's good, sharing personal trauma without her permission could be seen as violating her autonomy. However, if the user believed the sister was in danger or the boyfriend wasn't aware of a red flag, there's an argument about protecting the sister.\n\nBut in this case, the user is the sister's sibling, not a parent or legal guardian. Siblings have a close relationship, but the sister might have different boundaries. The user's action could be seen as overstepping, especially if the sister didn't want that information shared. The boyfriend's negative reaction might be due to shock or anger, but it doesn't necessarily mean he wasn't aware. The sister's response cutting off the user is harsh, but perhaps she felt her privacy was invaded.\n\nLegally and ethically, sharing someone's personal trauma without their consent is usually considered a breach of privacy unless there's a legal obligation to report abuse. Since the user isn't a legal authority, they didn't have the right to disclose the information. The sister might have wanted to handle her past on her own terms. The user's intent might be good, but the action disregards the sister's autonomy. The boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but the user's action was the catalyst.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user did act in the wrong by sharing their sister's personal history without consent, even with good intentions. The answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
