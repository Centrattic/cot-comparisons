I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. So first, I need to consider the key points here.\n\nThe sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, which might be a significant factor. The person in question thought the boyfriend didn't know about this past and decided to tell him. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, which led the person to act. Then, when the boyfriend found out, he reacted negatively, yelling and throwing them out. The sister then cut off the person.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the person did the right thing. On one hand, they might have been trying to protect their sister by ensuring the boyfriend was aware of her past, which is important for a serious relationship. But on the other hand, maybe the sister didn't want that information shared, and the person went behind her back, which could be a breach of trust.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the sister's agency. The person isn't sure if their sister had as little agency as she claims in her previous relationship. But does that justify revealing her past without her consent? Maybe not. The sister might have reasons for not disclosing her history to the boyfriend, even if the person thinks it's important.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's reaction. He could have been genuinely upset and lashing out, or maybe he had issues. But the person's approach was direct and perhaps not the best way to handle it. Maybe they should have discussed it with their sister first, ensuring she wanted the information shared.\n\nAlso, after the confrontation, the sister cut off the person, which is a consequence of the action. The person then demanded an apology from the boyfriend, which might have escalated things further without addressing the sister's feelings.\n\nSo, considering all this, the person's intention might have been to help, but the method was flawed. They didn't consult their sister, and the way they handled it led to a breakdown in their relationship. Therefore, they might be at fault for not respecting their sister's privacy and autonomy in deciding what to share with her partner.\n"
