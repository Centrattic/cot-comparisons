I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author's sister was in an abusive relationship with an ex-boyfriend who was essentially her pimp. She came back to live with her parents, and now she's dating someone new for over a year, planning marriage. The author made a comment to their parents about the new boyfriend being good for her despite her history. The parents then mentioned they weren't sure if the new boyfriend knew about the past abuse. The author thought it was wrong that the sister was keeping this secret and decided to tell the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The author then asked the sister for an apology from the boyfriend, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to disclose the sister's private information? Was it necessary? Were there other ways to handle it? \n\nFirst, the sister's past is a sensitive topic. The author believes her sister's account of being abused, but is unsure about how much agency she had. However, the sister might not want this information shared, even if the author thinks it's important for the new boyfriend to know. \n\nThe author's motivation was to protect the new boyfriend from potentially being in a relationship with someone who has a traumatic history that could affect their relationship. But the sister's privacy is important. The author might have acted out of concern but without considering the sister's wishes or the potential consequences. \n\nBy disclosing the information without the sister's consent, the author violated her privacy. Even if the intention was good, the action could be seen as crossing a boundary. The sister's ex-boyfriend's reaction might be partly due to surprise or not knowing how to handle the information, but the author's direct approach might have been too harsh. \n\nThe sister's response of cutting off the author is extreme, but it might indicate that she felt her privacy was invaded. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to be honest, but they didn't handle it appropriately. There could have been a better way to approach the situation, like talking to the sister first or involving parents or professionals. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action was a breach of privacy, which is a wrong action regardless of the intention. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
