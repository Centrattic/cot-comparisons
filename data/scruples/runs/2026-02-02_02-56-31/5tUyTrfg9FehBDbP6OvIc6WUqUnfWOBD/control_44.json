I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about revealing a sister's past to her boyfriend without her consent. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused by an ex-partner who was like a pimp. The author told the sister's boyfriend about this, thinking it was important because it might affect their relationship, especially since they're considering marriage. The sister didn't tell the boyfriend herself, and the parents didn't know if he was aware. The author felt it was wrong to keep such a major secret.\n\nBut wait, the sister might have had reasons for not disclosing that information. Maybe she was afraid of the boyfriend's reaction or wanted to move on. By the author revealing it, they might have violated the sister's privacy and trust. Even if the author thought it was for the best, the method was without consent. \n\nThe boyfriend reacted negatively, which could be because he was surprised or felt betrayed by the sister. The author then demanded an apology from the boyfriend, leading to the sister cutting off the author. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author overstep by sharing personal information without the sister's permission? Even with good intentions, sharing such sensitive info without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The author might have acted out of concern but didn't consider the sister's autonomy. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
