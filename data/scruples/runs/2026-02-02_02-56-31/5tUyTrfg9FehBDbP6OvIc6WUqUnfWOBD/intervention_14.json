I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive relationship where she claimed her ex was her pimp. The sister is currently in a serious relationship with this guy, and the user felt it was important for him to know the truth. The parents were unsure if he knew, and the user took it upon themselves to inform him, leading to the boyfriend lashing out and the sister cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's intentions. They believed the boyfriend had a right to know the sister's history, especially since the sister might have been hiding it. The user's concern is valid because withholding such information could affect the relationship's future, especially if they're considering marriage. However, the way the user approached it\u2014telling the boyfriend directly without consulting the sister first\u2014might be problematic.\n\nThe sister's past is a sensitive topic. Even if the user has doubts about her sister's agency, the sister might have reasons for not disclosing it to her current partner. Maybe she's not ready, or maybe the boyfriend already knows. The user's action could be seen as overstepping, invading privacy, or causing harm without considering the consequences. The boyfriend's reaction might be due to the shock of the information or feeling betrayed by the sister for not telling him.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might believe they were doing the right thing by ensuring the boyfriend was aware of potential red flags. However, the method of delivery and the lack of communication with the sister beforehand could have been a mistake. The user didn't give the sister a chance to address it herself, which could be why she's upset and why the boyfriend reacted negatively.\n\nThe key points here are consent to share personal information and the approach taken. The user didn't have the sister's permission to disclose her history. Even if the intent was good, the action might have violated the sister's privacy and trust. The sister's response suggests she felt betrayed, which points to the user being in the wrong. The boyfriend's anger could be justified if the sister deliberately hid her past, but the user's role in revealing it without her consent compounds the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user had good intentions, they may have acted without considering the sister's autonomy and the potential fallout. The right approach might have been to discuss it with the sister first, encouraging her to be honest with her partner rather than doing it themselves. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (in the wrong).\n"
