I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her sister's boyfriend about her sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, the author's sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. She's now dating someone new, and the author thinks it's wrong that the sister didn't tell the new boyfriend about her past. The author tells the boyfriend, and he reacts angrily, leading to a fallout with the sister.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. The sister didn't tell the boyfriend, so maybe she wanted to keep it private. The author stepped in because she felt the boyfriend should know, but that's crossing into the sister's personal decision. \n\nAbuse is a serious matter, but sharing someone's private information without their consent can be a breach of trust. Even if the author had good intentions, she might have overstepped. The boyfriend's reaction could be because he felt blindsided, but maybe the sister had her reasons for not telling him. \n\nAlso, the sister cutting off the author is a big deal. The author might have damaged the relationship without realizing the consequences. The parents' initial hesitation suggests they were concerned about the boyfriend knowing, which might imply that the sister didn't want him to know. \n\nSo, the author's actions were well-meaning but perhaps not respecting her sister's autonomy. She shouldn't have shared the information without the sister's permission. Even if the sister's judgment is questionable, the author's disclosure was an invasion of privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
