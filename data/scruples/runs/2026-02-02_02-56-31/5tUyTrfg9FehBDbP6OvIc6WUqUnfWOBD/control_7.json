I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past. \n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where she claims she had little agency, which is a serious issue. The author believes it's wrong to hide such a significant detail from her boyfriend, especially since they're planning marriage. The author's parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, which adds context to why the author might have felt compelled to act.\n\nThe author's main argument is that transparency is important for a healthy relationship, especially one as serious as marriage. They might have thought that the boyfriend had a right to know about her past trauma to make an informed decision. However, the way the information was shared could be problematic. The author went directly to the boyfriend without discussing it with their sister first, which might have violated her privacy. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive, which could indicate that he wasn't ready to hear that information or perhaps he already knew and was upset about the author revealing it. The sister then cut off the author, which complicates things further. \n\nLegally and ethically, sharing someone's private information without consent is generally wrong unless it's to prevent harm. The author might have believed they were acting in their sister's best interest, but the method was intrusive. The sister's past is her story to tell, and the author's intervention could have been seen as overstepping.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intentions might be good, but the action of revealing sensitive information without the sister's consent is a breach of privacy. Even if the author thought it was necessary, the approach was flawed. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
