I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the sister was in an abusive relationship that ended with her being a victim of abuse and possibly being pimped. The sister is now in a serious relationship with a new boyfriend, talking marriage. The author, concerned about the sister's history and her current boyfriend's lack of knowledge, decides to tell the boyfriend the truth. The boyfriend reacts negatively, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cuts the author off.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped by disclosing the sister's private information without consent. The sister might have chosen not to share her past with her current partner for various reasons\u2014maybe she's not ready, maybe she's trying to move on, maybe she doesn't want to burden him. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from potential issues, but disclosing such sensitive info without the sister's consent is a big deal.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to be honest and maybe prevent the boyfriend from being in a situation where he's unaware of a major part of the sister's history. On the other hand, the sister's privacy and autonomy are important. There's a trust issue between siblings, especially when it comes to personal pasts. Also, the author's judgment about the sister's agency in the previous relationship might not be entirely valid; the sister might have a different perspective on her own experiences.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the author's action of revealing the truth without consent is the main point of contention. Even if the author's intentions were good, the method of sharing the information without the sister's permission could be seen as a violation of her privacy. The sister's response indicates that she values her privacy and possibly her partner's current relationship, and the author's intervention might have caused unnecessary harm.\n\nIn many cases, family members don't have the right to disclose another adult's private information without their consent, unless there's a risk of harm. Here, the author might believe they were preventing harm, but the decision to share such information is typically up to the individual involved. The sister might feel that her autonomy was disrespected, leading to the breakdown in her relationship with the author.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions likely crossed a boundary, making them at least partially responsible for the fallout. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
