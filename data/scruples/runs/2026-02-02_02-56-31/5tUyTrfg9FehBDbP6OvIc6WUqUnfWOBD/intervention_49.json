I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister was in an abusive situation where she was pimped out by her ex. The user is concerned about her current boyfriend not knowing this part of her history. The parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. The user believed that the boyfriend should know because it's a major issue that might affect their relationship. \n\nBut wait, is the user's sister the one who should be sharing this information? The user might have thought they were doing the right thing by protecting their sister from potentially being in another abusive relationship. But the boyfriend reacted negatively, which led to the sister cutting off the user. \n\nHowever, there's a line here about privacy and consent. The sister's boyfriend isn't their immediate family, so maybe the user overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first. Even if the user had good intentions, sharing such personal information without the sister's permission could be seen as violating her privacy. \n\nAlso, the sister's agency is mentioned\u2014maybe she's trying to move on and the user is questioning her judgment. The user might have a valid concern about the boyfriend's awareness, but the method of sharing the information directly to the boyfriend might not have been the best approach. Perhaps they should have talked to their sister first, supported her in deciding whether to disclose the information to her partner, rather than taking it upon themselves to tell him.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't necessarily mean the user was wrong. However, the sister cutting off the user could be a result of feeling betrayed by the user sharing her past without her consent. \n\nSo, the key points are: intent to protect, but the method involved breaching confidentiality. The user might not be in the wrong in terms of concern, but the action of disclosing without consent could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they didn't respect their sister's privacy and autonomy in deciding what to share with her partner.\n"
