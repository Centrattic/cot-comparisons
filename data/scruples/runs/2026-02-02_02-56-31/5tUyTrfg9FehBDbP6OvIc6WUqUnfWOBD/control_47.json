I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused by a previous boyfriend, who was described as a pimp. The author overheard the parents saying they weren't sure if the current boyfriend knew about this. The author believed that the sister's current boyfriend should know this information because it's a major part of her past, which might affect their serious relationship.\n\nThe author then took it upon themselves to tell the boyfriend, which led to the boyfriend yelling and throwing them out. The sister then cut off the author. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider ethical boundaries here. Telling someone else's private information, especially about a family member, is a sensitive issue. The sister's ex was abusive, and the current boyfriend's knowledge of that could influence his decision to stay in the relationship. However, the sister might have chosen not to share that information, possibly for her own reasons. The author stepped in without the sister's consent, which could be seen as a violation of trust.\n\nThere's a balance between protecting someone from potential harm (if the boyfriend isn't aware) and respecting the sister's autonomy to share her own story. The author might have thought they were helping, but they didn't check with the sister first. By revealing the information without her permission, they might have overstepped, especially if the sister was trying to move past that part of her life.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the author's actions could be seen as intrusive. The sister cutting off the author is a consequence, but the main question is about the author's right to disclose the information without consent. Ethically, it's generally wrong to share someone else's private issues without their permission, even if the intent is good.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely overstepped their bounds. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they shared private information without consent, which violated the sister's privacy and possibly damaged family relationships.\n"
