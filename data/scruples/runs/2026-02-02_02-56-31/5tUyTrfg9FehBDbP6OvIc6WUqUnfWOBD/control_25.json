I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse and pimping. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she claims she had little agency. The author thought it was wrong to hide this from her current boyfriend, who's considering marriage. The parents were unsure if he knew, so the author decided to tell him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister ended the relationship with the author.\n\nNow, thinking about boundaries and privacy. The sister's experience is very sensitive. Even if the author is concerned, sharing such personal information without consent can be a breach of trust. The author might believe they're protecting their sister or the boyfriend, but that's not the sister's decision to make. \n\nAlso, the sister's account of her past is her story to tell. The author's judgment about her agency could be invalidating her experience. Even if the author suspects the sister isn't being truthful, that's not their place to correct unless there's a clear risk of harm. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is a red flag, but the author's method of confronting him directly without discussing it with the sister first might have been the wrong approach. The sister's response cutting off the author shows the impact of this breach of trust. \n\nIn ethical terms, the author might have overstepped by disclosing private information without the sister's consent. It's important to let individuals decide how to share their own history, especially traumatic experiences. The author's intention might have been to help, but the method was invasive and crossed personal boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
