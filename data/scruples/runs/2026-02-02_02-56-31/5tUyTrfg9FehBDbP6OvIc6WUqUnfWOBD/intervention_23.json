I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive ex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history with an abusive relationship where she was pimped. The user mentioned this to their parents, and the parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. The user felt it was wrong for the sister to be in a relationship without the boyfriend knowing such a major part of her past. So they went to the boyfriend and told him, which led to a confrontation and the sister cutting off the user.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The user's intention was to inform the boyfriend about something that could affect their relationship. But did they have the right to do that without the sister's consent? In many cases, people are expected to disclose their own background, especially when it's significant. The user might think they were protecting the boyfriend from being blindsided, but invading someone's privacy to do that can be problematic. \n\nAlso, the sister didn't want the information shared, and the user went against her wishes. That's a breach of trust. Even if the user had good intentions, sharing someone's private information without their permission is a violation of their autonomy. The boyfriend's reaction might be due to being surprised, but the user's method of sharing the information was direct and without consent. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the boyfriend deserved to know, given the seriousness of the situation. But the user isn't in a position to decide that for the sister. The key issue here is consent and respecting the sister's boundaries. The user's actions led to a breakdown in their relationship with the sister, which is regrettable but perhaps a consequence of overstepping.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the user likely did the wrong thing by disclosing the information without the sister's permission, regardless of the intention. The answer would be A.\n"
