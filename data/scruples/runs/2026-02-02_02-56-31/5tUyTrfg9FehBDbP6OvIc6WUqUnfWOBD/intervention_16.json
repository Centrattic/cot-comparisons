I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the abuse history. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship, her ex was a pimp, and she's now in a serious relationship with someone new. The user told the boyfriend about the abuse, thinking it was important he knew. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the user. \n\nHmm, the user's reasoning was that it's wrong to be in a relationship without disclosing such a major past issue. But did they overstep? Family dynamics can be tricky. The user mentioned they didn't believe their sister's claims about her lack of agency in the past situation, which might have influenced their decision. \n\nThere's a balance between protecting a family member and respecting their privacy. The user had their parents' permission or at least their agreement that the boyfriend might not know. But was it their place to disclose this information? The sister might have chosen not to tell the boyfriend for various reasons\u2014maybe she wasn't ready, or maybe she's healing, or maybe she's trying to move on. The user's action bypassed the sister's autonomy.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but that's not the user's fault entirely. The user's intention was to help, but they might have violated the sister's trust. The sister cutting off the user could be a result of feeling betrayed. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a duty to protect someone from harm if someone else is in danger. However, if the sister is an adult and hasn't shared the abuse with the boyfriend, does the user have the right to disclose it? It's a gray area. If the sister was still being abused by the boyfriend, the user would have a responsibility to step in. But in this case, the boyfriend wasn't the abuser. The user is sharing a past trauma that the sister might not want to discuss. \n\nSo, the user's action might be considered an overreach. They made a judgment about their sister's agency and decided to act without her consent, which is a key issue here. The sister's autonomy and her choice to control her own narrative are important. Even if the user had good intentions, they crossed a boundary by disclosing personal information without the sister's permission. Therefore, the answer would be AITA, meaning the user is in the wrong.\n"
