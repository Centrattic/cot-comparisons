I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past with abuse. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, which the user mentioned to their parents, and the parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. The user decided to tell the boyfriend directly, which led to the boyfriend yelling and throwing them out. The sister then cut off the user.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's intentions. They thought it was wrong for the sister to be in a serious relationship without the boyfriend knowing about her abusive past. The user believed that most people would reconsider if they knew the truth. So their motive was to protect their sister, maybe to prevent her from getting hurt again if the boyfriend didn't know the history.\n\nHowever, the user didn't get permission from their sister to share this information. Even if the user had good intentions, the sister might have wanted to disclose that on her own terms. By doing it without her consent, the user might have violated her privacy and trust. That's a key point here. In many cases, sharing someone else's private information without their permission can be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the intention is to help.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was strong\u2014yelling and throwing them out. That could indicate he was shocked or upset, but maybe his reaction wasn't justified. However, the user's action without consent might have been the catalyst. The sister then cut off the user, which shows the impact of the user's actions on their relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's agency. The user is unsure if the sister had as little control as she claimed in her previous relationship. But the user's assumption doesn't give them the right to disclose the information. Even if the sister did have agency, the disclosure was made without her permission.\n\nLegal and ethical boundaries matter here. People have the right to privacy, especially regarding past traumatic experiences. The user's actions, though well-meaning, might have been a breach of that privacy. The key question is whether the user had the right to share that information without consent, regardless of the intention.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the user's intent was good, the method was questionable. The sister might have had her own reasons for not disclosing the past, such as fear of rejection or wanting to move on. The user's action could have forced the issue and caused harm instead of preventing it.\n\nSo, putting this all together, while the user's intentions might be understandable, the action of sharing private information without consent is generally considered wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (I am in the wrong).\n"
