I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend the truth about her past. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was basically a pimp. She's now with a new guy, and the author thinks it's wrong that she hasn't told him about her past. The author feels the sister might not be fully honest about her role in that old relationship. The parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. So the author decides to tell the boyfriend directly, which leads to a confrontation.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author have the right to share this information? The sister didn't tell the boyfriend, so was it the author's responsibility to do so? On one hand, the author might be concerned about the boyfriend being unaware of something major that could affect their relationship. On the other hand, the sister might have a right to privacy, and the author overstepped by not discussing it with her first.\n\nBut wait, the sister's past could be a significant red flag. If the boyfriend didn't know, maybe it's important for him to be aware, especially since they're talking about marriage. However, the author's approach was to tell the boyfriend without the sister's consent. That could be seen as violating her privacy. Also, the sister might have valid reasons for not disclosing her past at that time\u2014maybe she's working through it, or it's a sensitive topic she's not ready to share.\n\nThe author's motivation is to protect the boyfriend from potentially being in a situation where he's unaware of the sister's history. But by doing so without the sister's consent, the author might have breached trust. The sister then reacted by cutting off the author, which suggests that she felt her privacy was invaded.\n\nIs there a balance between protecting someone and respecting another's privacy? The author might argue that the boyfriend has a right to know, especially if it's a major factor in their future. But others might say that the author should have first approached the sister to understand her reasons and perhaps encourage her to be honest with her boyfriend themselves.\n\nAlso, the author's judgment about the sister's agency in her past relationship could be problematic. The author isn't in a position to assess the sister's experiences, which could lead to misunderstandings. The sister might have her own reasons for downplaying her role, which could be part of her healing process.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on the ethical stance. If privacy and consent are prioritized, then the author overstepped. If the duty to protect the boyfriend from being in an uninformed relationship is prioritized, then the author acted in good faith. However, the method of disclosure was direct and without consent, which is a critical issue. The sister's reaction indicates that she felt betrayed, so the author's action might have caused more harm than good.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, even if their intentions were to protect the boyfriend. The ethical line here is crossed by not respecting the sister's autonomy to decide when and how to share her past.\n"
