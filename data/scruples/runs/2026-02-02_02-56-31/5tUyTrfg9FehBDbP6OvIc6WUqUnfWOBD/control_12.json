I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past involving abuse and being a pimp. The sister had been hiding this from the boyfriend, and the author decided to tell him directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's confidentiality. The sister might have kept this information private for a reason. The author stepping in could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the sister didn't want her boyfriend to know. But on the other hand, the author is concerned about their sister's well-being and safety. If the boyfriend was unaware of the abuse, maybe the sister was putting herself at risk again by not being honest with him.\n\nThe author's parents were also unsure if the boyfriend knew, which adds to the confusion. The author's intention was to act in their sister's best interest by ensuring the boyfriend knew the history, to protect her. However, the way they approached it\u2014telling the boyfriend directly without consulting the sister first\u2014might have been inappropriate. The sister could have wanted to disclose this information herself in her own time, and the author's actions might have caused unnecessary conflict.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive, which is bad, but the author's method of disclosure might have contributed to that. The sister then cut off the author. The question is whether the author overstepped by revealing the sensitive information without the sister's consent. In most cases, personal information, especially about abuse, is considered private, and sharing it without permission can be a violation of that person's autonomy.\n\nSo, even if the author had good intentions, the act of disclosing without the sister's approval might be considered wrong. The sister's agency in handling her own relationships is important. The author might have thought they were helping, but respecting the sister's right to decide when and if to share her past is crucial. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy, even if their motives were good.\n"
