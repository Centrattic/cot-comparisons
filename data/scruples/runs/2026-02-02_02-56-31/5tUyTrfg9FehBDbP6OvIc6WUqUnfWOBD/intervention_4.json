  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. First, I need to consider the context. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The user thinks it's wrong that the boyfriend didn't know this, as most people might not want to date someone with such a history. The user's parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, so the user took the initiative to tell him.\n\nNow, the boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the user out. The sister then cut off the user. The user is questioning their actions. \n\nI should consider the ethical implications here. On one hand, the sister's history is significant and relevant to the relationship. The boyfriend has a right to know about potential red flags. On the other hand, the user didn't get permission from the sister to disclose that information. Bypassing her consent could be a breach of trust, even with good intentions. \n\nHowever, the sister had chosen to keep her past hidden from her boyfriend, which the user believes is dishonest. The user might think they're protecting the boyfriend from being deceived. But the sister might see it as an invasion of her privacy and autonomy. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a factor. If he's upset because he didn't know, maybe he's concerned. But if he's angry at the user, that's a problem. However, the user's approach might have been confrontational. Approaching the situation differently, like talking to the sister first, could have been better. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user had a valid concern but handled it without the sister's consent. That's a key point. So while the intention was to prevent harm, the method might have been wrong. The sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her past is important. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the user is in the wrong) because they disclosed personal information without consent. However, there's a grey area because the information was about abuse, which is significant. But legally and ethically, consent matters. Even with good intentions, without consent, it's a breach. So, the user likely is in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. \n\nWait, but the user's parents thought the boyfriend didn't know, so maybe they had a duty to inform? Not sure. The user's role as a sibling to protect the boyfriend isn't clear. The main issue is the sister's right to privacy. So, the answer is A.\n"
