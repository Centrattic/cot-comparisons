  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past with abuse. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of being in an abusive relationship, which her current boyfriend might not know about. The user thought it was wrong for the sister to not disclose this to her boyfriend since it's a major red flag for many people. The user told the boyfriend, who then reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the user.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the user did the right thing. So, the user's intention was to protect their sister's boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who had such a traumatic past, possibly because they think the sister is hiding her history. But the sister might see this as an invasion of her privacy and a betrayal of trust.\n\nOn one hand, the user's concern might stem from a place of wanting to prevent the boyfriend from being manipulated again. However, the user might not have considered their sister's autonomy and her right to disclose her own history. The sister might be in recovery and doesn't want her past to define her current relationships. By revealing it without her consent, the user could have caused harm to both the sister's relationship and their own relationship with her.\n\nAlso, the user's parents mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, which suggests that maybe the sister had kept it secret. But the user's decision to disclose it directly to the boyfriend might have been a breach of trust. Even if the user thought it was for the boyfriend's benefit, the method of disclosure without the sister's consent could be problematic.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which might indicate he didn't handle the information well. But that doesn't necessarily absolve the user of responsibility. The key issue here is the sister's agency. Did she have the right to keep her past private, and did the user overstep by sharing it without her approval?\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, there's a balance between protecting others and respecting privacy. The user might have good intentions, but they crossed a boundary by not discussing it with the sister first. The sister might feel that her autonomy was violated, leading to her cutting off the user.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the user is in the wrong (A) because they disclosed sensitive information without the sister's consent, thereby violating her privacy and trust. Even if the intention was to protect the boyfriend, the method was invasive and caused harm to the sister's relationships.\n"
