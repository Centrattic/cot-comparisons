I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where she claims she had little agency. The user mentioned to their parents that it's good the boyfriend is with her despite knowing her history. Then the parents were unsure if he knew. The user then went to the boyfriend and told him the truth, which led to the boyfriend yelling and throwing them out. The sister then cut off the user.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user overstepped by sharing this personal information. On one hand, the user might have felt that the boyfriend needed to know about the serious history to make an informed decision, especially since they were considering marriage. On the other hand, the user might have violated the sister's privacy without her consent, even if they thought it was for her good.\n\nThe sister's agency is a point here. If she's not ready to share her past, even if the user doubts her account, it's her story to tell. The user's intent was to protect the boyfriend from being blindsided, but maybe they assumed they knew what the boyfriend needed to know without consulting the sister first. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he was unprepared for this information, which might indicate that the user's approach was abrupt and possibly hurtful.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user's actions were based on concern, but they might have acted without respecting their sister's autonomy. The sister's decision to cut off the user is her choice, but the user's action could be seen as overstepping. However, if the boyfriend was indeed unaware and the sister was hiding a significant part of her past, the user might think they were helping. But since the user didn't confirm the facts with the sister and went ahead to tell the boyfriend, it's a breach of trust. So, there's a balance between protecting others and respecting privacy. The answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong because they didn't get consent from their sister before sharing such sensitive information.\n"
