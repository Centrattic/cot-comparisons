I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past being abused and pimped by an ex. The sister is currently in a serious relationship, and the author thought it was wrong to keep this secret. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's sister was in an abusive situation, which is a serious matter. The author believed the boyfriend didn't know about this past, and thought it was important for him to know because it's a major issue. However, the sister might have kept this hidden for a reason, maybe to protect herself or because she's not ready to discuss it. \n\nThe author's action was to disclose this information directly to the boyfriend without consulting the sister first. That could be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the author had good intentions, sharing someone's personal and traumatic experiences without their consent is generally considered unethical. The boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the author might not be at fault if the information was necessary. However, the sister's response of cutting off the author suggests that she felt violated.\n\nI should also think about consent and boundaries. The sister might have chosen not to share her past with the boyfriend, and the author stepping in could have undermined her autonomy. On the other hand, if the boyfriend was genuinely unaware and the situation could affect their relationship, there's an argument that the author had a duty to inform him. But in relationships, especially when it's a family member, it's usually up to the individual to disclose their own history.\n\nAnother angle is the method of disclosure. The author approached the boyfriend directly without discussing it with the sister first. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the sister about her reasons for not telling the boyfriend and see if she wanted support in disclosing it herself. By going around her, the author might have overstepped.\n\nThe outcome was that the boyfriend was upset, and the sister was angry. The author's intention was to help, but the execution might have been problematic. The key here is whether the author had the right to share that information without the sister's consent. In most cases, sharing someone's private trauma without their permission is a violation of trust, which would make the author at fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision to disclose the information directly to the boyfriend without the sister's consent likely crossed a boundary. Even if the author had good intentions, respecting the sister's autonomy and privacy is important. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
