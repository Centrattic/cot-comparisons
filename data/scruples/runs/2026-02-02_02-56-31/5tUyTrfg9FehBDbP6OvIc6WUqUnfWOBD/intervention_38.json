  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused by her ex, who also pimped her out. She's now in a serious relationship with another guy. The user mentioned this to their parents, who weren't sure if the new boyfriend knew. The user thought it was wrong that the sister was hiding this from him, so they went to the boyfriend and told him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister cut off the user.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The sister's past is significant, especially since it's about abuse and exploitation. The user's intention was to inform the boyfriend to protect him from potential issues. However, the way it was done might be problematic. The user didn't consult the sister first, which is a key point. Even if the sister's current partner knew, the user didn't have the sister's permission to share such personal information. That's a breach of trust.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of the sister's well-being. If the new boyfriend wasn't aware of her history, the user might be trying to prevent future harm. However, the user's approach was confrontational without ensuring the sister was okay with it. The sister's reaction could indicate that she found the user's actions invasive, even if the intent was good.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction suggests he wasn't prepared for that information, but the user didn't have the right to disclose it in the first place. The sister might have been trying to move past her trauma, and the user's action might have violated her privacy. Even if the user believes the sister is hiding her agency, it's not their place to expose that without her consent.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the violation of privacy and trust. The user acted without the sister's approval, which is a key factor. Intentions aside, sharing someone's private information without their consent is generally wrong. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
