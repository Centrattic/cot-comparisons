I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for telling her sister's boyfriend about the abuse history.\n\nFirst, the sister had a past abusive relationship. The author believes that the boyfriend might not know about it and feels it's important he knows because it's a major factor. The author's parents also thought the boyfriend might not know. So the author goes to the boyfriend and tells him, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the sister's situation. The sister is in a serious relationship, and the author is her sibling. The author's intention was to inform the boyfriend about the sister's history, thinking it's necessary for him to know. But the boyfriend reacted negatively, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The sister hasn't shared her history with her boyfriend, and the author decided to do it without her consent. Even if the author had good intentions, sharing someone else's personal information without their permission can be a breach of trust. The sister might value her privacy and autonomy in deciding what to share with her partner.\n\nAlso, the author is unsure about the sister's level of agency in the past abuse. That's a sensitive area. The author's judgment about the sister's past could influence their decision to disclose, but that's not the sister's to validate. The author's actions might have stemmed from concern, but the method was invasive.\n\nIn relationships, it's usually up to the individual to share their history. The author's intervention might have been well-meaning, but without the sister's approval, it's a violation of her privacy. The boyfriend's reaction, though harsh, might be a result of being blindsided by information he wasn't prepared for, especially if the sister had kept it secret. The sister cutting off the author is a consequence of this breach, which the author might not have anticipated.\n\nSo, while the author's concern for the sister's well-being is understandable, the action of disclosure without consent is problematic. It's a classic case of good intentions leading to negative consequences due to crossed boundaries. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
