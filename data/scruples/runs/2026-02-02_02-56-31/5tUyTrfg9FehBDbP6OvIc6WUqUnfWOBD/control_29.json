I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about them telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The key points here are whether the author had the right to share that information and how they handled it.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused and pimps, and she's been with this guy for over a year, possibly considering marriage. The author feels that it's wrong for the sister to be in a relationship without revealing such a major part of her past. The author's parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so the author decided to tell him directly. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author crossed a line. In some cases, sharing personal and sensitive information without consent can be a breach of privacy. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past to the boyfriend, maybe because she wanted to move on, rebuild trust, or for other personal reasons. By revealing it, the author might have undermined her autonomy in deciding what to share and when. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive\u2014he yelled and threw the author out. This could be because he was surprised or because he didn't take the news well. But the author then demanded a heartfelt apology from the boyfriend, which might imply that the boyfriend's reaction was wrong. However, the boyfriend's anger could be a result of being blindsided with such information, especially if it's personal and sensitive. \n\nThe sister then cuts off the author, which shows that she's upset with the intervention. The author's intention was to inform the boyfriend, but the sister might feel that her privacy was violated, regardless of the author's motives. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention was to protect their sister or the boyfriend, the act of sharing such personal information without the sister's consent could be seen as overstepping. The right to privacy is important, and family members might have different views on what's necessary to share. Unless there was a legal obligation or imminent danger, the author might have acted inappropriately by disclosing the information without the sister's permission. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they shared their sister's private information without her consent, which is a breach of trust and privacy. The sister's right to control her own narrative in the relationship should be respected, even if the author believed they were being truthful.\n"
