I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about a past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister had a history of being abused by an ex, and the author thinks it's wrong that the current boyfriend doesn't know this. The author tells him, leading to conflict.\n\nThe main question is whether the author overstepped. The sister's privacy is a big factor here. Even if the author is concerned, sharing such personal information without consent can be problematic. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past, which is her right. The author's action could be seen as violating her privacy.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation matters. They mention they're unsure if the sister's account of her past is accurate. That suggests maybe the author has some doubts about the sister's version of events. But even if that's the case, it's not their place to question or expose the sister's history without her consent.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, but maybe because he felt betrayed by the sister, not necessarily because the author was wrong. The sister then cut off the author, which shows the impact of the action was severe.\n\nEthically, the line between helping and interfering is thin. While the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, they didn't consider the sister's autonomy. The sister might have reasons for not telling her boyfriend, such as fear of rejection or wanting to move forward. The author's action might have caused harm without the sister's approval.\n\nIn many cases, family members have a right to privacy. Unless there's a legal obligation (like if someone is in danger), sharing someone else's personal trauma is a breach of trust. The author didn't check with the sister first, which is a mistake. They assumed they knew what was best, which isn't fair.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely did something wrong by disclosing the sister's private information without her consent, even with good intentions. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
