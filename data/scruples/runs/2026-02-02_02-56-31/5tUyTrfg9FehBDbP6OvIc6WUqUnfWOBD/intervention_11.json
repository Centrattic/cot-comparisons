I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her abusive past. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister has been dating this guy for over a year, and they're talking marriage. The user mentions the sister's history with an abusive ex who was like a pimp. The user's parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so the user took it upon themselves to tell him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the user out. The sister then cut off the user.\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. The user's intention was to protect their sister's boyfriend from being in a relationship without full knowledge of her past. But did they have the right to share such personal information without the sister's consent? \n\nIn many cultures, disclosing someone's private medical or emotional history without their permission is a violation of their privacy and autonomy. Even if the user's motives were good, they didn't consult the sister first. The sister might have her reasons for not sharing that past, maybe she's still healing or fears rejection. By revealing this information, the user might have breached trust, which is a big deal in family relationships.\n\nAlso, the way the boyfriend reacted could be due to shock or genuine anger, but the user's approach might have been confrontational. Instead of approaching the boyfriend, maybe the user should have focused on supporting the sister or discussing it with the family to find a better way to handle the situation. \n\nThe sister's response to cut off the user suggests deep hurt, which indicates that the user's actions had significant negative consequences. Even if the user believed the sister wasn't being truthful about her agency in the previous relationship, it's not their place to disclose such sensitive information to others without consent. \n\nThere's also the aspect of family boundaries. The user stepping into the relationship to inform the boyfriend might be seen as overstepping. The sister might feel that her privacy was invaded, leading to the breakdown in their relationship. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the user intended to act in good faith, the method was flawed. Privacy and consent are crucial, especially regarding sensitive personal history. The user's actions, though possibly well-meaning, caused harm to their relationship with the sister and likely to the sister's relationship with her boyfriend as well. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely AITA for the user, meaning they're at fault. They didn't respect their sister's autonomy and privacy, which are important considerations even with good intentions.\n"
