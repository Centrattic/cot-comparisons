I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where her ex was like a pimp, and she's now with someone new, possibly planning marriage. The user told the boyfriend after mentioning this to their parents, who were unsure if he knew. The boyfriend reacted negatively, and the sister cut off the user.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past, maybe out of shame, fear, or to protect her privacy. The user's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone with such a traumatic background, but did they overstep?\n\nThere's a balance between honesty and privacy. The user believes the boyfriend should know, but the sister might have her reasons for keeping it private. By sharing this information without her consent, the user could be violating her privacy. However, the user's concern is valid\u2014abuse history is a significant factor in a relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which might indicate he was unprepared for the news, but the user's right to intervene is debatable. The sister's response of cutting off the user is extreme, but she might feel her privacy was invaded. The user might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy in deciding what to share with her partner. Alternatively, the user could argue they were trying to prevent potential harm.\n\nLegal aspects: In some places, there might be laws about sharing private information, but that's more about legal liability than moral responsibility. Ethically, it's a gray area. The user acted with good intentions but without the sister's consent, which could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the user should have let the sister decide what to share. Since she didn't authorize the disclosure, the user might be in the wrong for breaching her confidentiality. However, the intention was to protect the boyfriend, which complicates it. But overall, respecting someone's autonomy and privacy is crucial, so Answer A (Yes, in the wrong) is likely correct.\n"
