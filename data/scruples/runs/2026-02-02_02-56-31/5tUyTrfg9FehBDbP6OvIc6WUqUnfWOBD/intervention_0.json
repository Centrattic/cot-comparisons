I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. The sister had a history with an abusive ex who was a pimp, and the user mentioned it to their parents, who weren't sure if the current boyfriend knew. The user then told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily, leading to the sister cutting off the user.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister was in an abusive situation, which is a serious matter. The user believes that the current boyfriend should know about this because it's a major issue that might affect their relationship. The user's intention was to be honest, thinking that the boyfriend might not stay with the sister if he knew the truth. However, the boyfriend reacted negatively, and the sister was upset with the user for breaking her privacy.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is about privacy versus the right to know. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past, either because she felt it was her personal matter or perhaps she was still healing and didn't want to burden her partner. The user, however, felt that the boyfriend had a right to know because it's a significant aspect of her history.\n\nBut does the user have the authority to disclose someone else's personal information, even if they believe it's for the other person's benefit? In many cases, people have the right to privacy, and sharing such information without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the user's intentions were good, they didn't consult the sister first, which could be a problem. The sister might have valid reasons for not telling her boyfriend yet, or maybe she's working through that with her own support system.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's concern is valid because the boyfriend is considering marriage, and such a history could impact the relationship. However, the appropriate approach might have been to talk to the sister first, express concerns, and let her decide how and when to share her past with her partner. By going directly to the boyfriend, the user bypassed the sister's autonomy, which could be why she reacted so strongly.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be due to being shocked and not knowing how to handle the information, leading to an emotional outburst. The user then asked for an apology, which the sister refused, cutting off the user. This shows that the sister feels her privacy was violated, and she's taking a stand to protect her relationship and her own boundaries.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The user might have good intentions, but acting without the sister's consent to share such personal information could be seen as overstepping. The sister's right to control her narrative and the information she shares about her past is important. The user's action, while coming from a place of concern, might not have respected the sister's autonomy and could have caused unnecessary harm.\n\nTherefore, the user might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's privacy and for not discussing it with her first. However, there's also a valid argument that the boyfriend had a right to know. But the method of disclosure, without the sister's consent, is problematic. So, the answer likely leans towards AITA (A for yes, the user is in the wrong).\n"
