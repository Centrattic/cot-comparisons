I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they did something wrong by telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. So first, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe sister was in an abusive relationship with a former partner who was a pimp. She's now with a new boyfriend for over a year, and the family is considering marriage. The user made a comment to their parents about the guy being good despite her history. Then the parents mentioned they weren't sure if he knew. The user thought it was wrong for the sister to not disclose this major detail, so they told the boyfriend directly. He reacted badly, yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister cut off the user.\n\nNow, the user is asking if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to weigh the ethical aspects here.\n\nOn one hand, the user might believe they were protecting their sister by ensuring the boyfriend knew the truth, which is a valid concern. Abusers often hide such things, so transparency is important. But on the other hand, the user didn't have the sister's consent to share her private information. Privacy is a big deal, and even if the intention was good, breaching someone's confidentiality without their permission can be problematic. \n\nAlso, the user isn't the boyfriend's responsibility to inform; that's the sister's role if she chooses. By stepping in, they might have overstepped, especially since the sister might not be ready to share her history, or maybe she's handling it her way. The reaction from the boyfriend was harsh, but that doesn't necessarily mean the user was wrong. However, the sister cutting them off is a consequence of the action.\n\nI need to consider if the user had a right to intervene. If the sister was in danger or the boyfriend was a threat, maybe. But since it's about the boyfriend's knowledge of her past, it's more about her right to disclose on her terms. The user's action might have violated her privacy, even if well-intentioned. So in ethical terms, sharing someone's trauma without their consent is generally wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (the user is in the wrong). But I should also consider the potential harm of not sharing, but since the sister didn't ask for help, the user's intervention was unwarranted.\n"
