I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the sister had kept hidden. The author's reasoning is that it's wrong for the sister to be in a serious relationship without the boyfriend knowing about such a major part of her history. \n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and boundaries. The sister might have chosen not to share her past for personal reasons. By telling the boyfriend without her consent, the author potentially violated her privacy. Even if the author's intentions were good, sharing someone else's personal history without their permission can be a breach of trust.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the author's own judgment. The author mentions doubting how much agency the sister had in her past situation. That raises the question of whether the author is in a position to judge her decisions. It's possible that the sister wanted to move past that chapter and didn't want it to affect her current relationship. The author's actions might have undermined her autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was harsh, yelling and throwing the author out. That suggests maybe the information was a shock, but does that justify the author's actions? The author's intention was to do the right thing by being honest, but the method involved without the sister's consent. \n\nAlso, the author's response to the boyfriend's reaction\u2014demanding an apology\u2014might have been too confrontational. Instead of trying to mediate or support the sister, the author took a stance that led to the sister cutting off contact. \n\nConsidering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because they shared personal information without permission, overstepped boundaries, and then escalated the situation by demanding an apology. The sister's right to privacy and autonomy in her relationship is important here. While the concern is valid, the approach was inappropriate.\n"
