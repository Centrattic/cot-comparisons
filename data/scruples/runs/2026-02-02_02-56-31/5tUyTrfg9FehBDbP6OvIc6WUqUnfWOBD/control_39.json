I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for telling her sister's boyfriend about her sister's past. The situation involves a sister who was in an abusive relationship, and the author believes she's not being honest with her current boyfriend. The parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew the history. The author confronted the boyfriend, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and boundaries. Sisters often share personal information, but sharing someone else's private history without their consent can be a breach of trust. The sister might have reasons for not disclosing her past, maybe she's not ready or there's stigma involved. The author's intention was to inform the boyfriend, thinking it's necessary for him to know. However, the way it was done\u2014without the sister's consent\u2014could be problematic.\n\nNext, the boyfriend's reaction was aggressive. The author expected a different response, but maybe he was shocked or upset. However, the author's action led to the boyfriend yelling and the sister cutting off contact. The key question is whether the author had the right to share that information. \n\nIn many cases, people have a right to privacy, even if others disagree with their choices. The sister might have chosen to keep her past private, and the author overstepped by revealing it. Unless there was immediate danger or the boyfriend was directly at risk (which isn't indicated here), the author's actions might be seen as invasive. \n\nAlso, the author's assumption about the sister's lack of agency in her past relationship could be biased. The sister might have her own reasons for how she portrays her past, and the author's judgment may not be fair. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the boyfriend being unaware of a significant issue that could affect their relationship is valid. However, the correct approach might have been to talk to the sister first, encourage her to disclose the information herself, rather than stepping in and sharing it without her consent. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's intent was to protect the sister, but the method violated her privacy. The sister's right to control her narrative is important. The author's actions likely caused harm to the relationship without the sister's agreement, making the author at fault here. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they breached the sister's confidentiality without her consent, which is a key factor in determining accountability in such situations.\n"
