I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive ex who was a pimp. The key points here are the sister's history, the sister's current relationship, the user's disclosure, and the resulting fallout.\n\nFirst, the sister's history is serious\u2014she was in an abusive situation. The user thinks it's wrong that she's with this guy without revealing that past. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the user decided to tell him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister now wants the user out of her life.\n\nI need to consider the ethics of disclosure. In some cases, people choose to keep their past private unless it affects the new relationship. The user's action was meant to be honest, but did they have the right to share that information without the sister's consent? The sister might have her reasons for not telling the boyfriend, maybe fear of rejection or not wanting to burden him. The user's intention was to inform the boyfriend, but the sister sees it as a betrayal.\n\nThen there's the question of the user's judgment about the sister's agency. The user doubts how little control the sister had, which might come off as dismissive of her experience. However, the main issue is the act of disclosure. Even if the user's intent was good, sharing personal and sensitive information without consent can be a breach of trust, especially in family dynamics.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the user's action might have violated the sister's privacy. The sister's response is extreme, but it shows that the user's action was a significant breach. The user might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect their sibling, but the method was questionable. The ethical dilemma here is between honesty and respecting others' autonomy to decide what to share about their lives.\n\nSo, the answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because the user didn't have the sister's permission to share such personal details. Even if the concern was valid, the sister had the right to choose when and how to disclose her past. The user's intervention might have caused more harm than good, leading to the loss of the relationship with their sister.\n"
