  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation involves their sister's abusive past and a new boyfriend. The key points are:\n\n1. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was a pimp. She's now with a new guy, and the person in question told him the truth about her past.\n2. The sister didn't disclose her history to the boyfriend, and the person thought it was wrong to hide that. They told the boyfriend, which led to conflict.\n3. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the person acted appropriately. The sister's past is significant and could affect the relationship. However, the sister might have chosen not to share that information for her own reasons\u2014maybe she's not ready, or she's trying to move on. The person intervened without the sister's consent, which could be seen as overstepping. They might have a concern for their sister's well-being, but sharing such personal information without her permission could breach her trust.\n\nThe parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so maybe the sister was keeping it secret. The person's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being misled, but the way they handled it without considering the sister's feelings might be problematic. The sister's reaction suggests she felt betrayed.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which is concerning. The person might have acted out of genuine concern, but the method was intrusive. The sister's right to privacy and autonomy is a factor here. The person might not be entirely at fault, but they did take a risky step without respecting the sister's choice to disclose or not.\n\nIn some cases, intervening in family dynamics can be sensitive. The answer might depend on the cultural context or the family's values. However, generally, unless there's a risk of harm, revealing someone's private information without consent can be wrong. The sister might have wanted to handle her past on her own terms. The person's actions, while well-intentioned, might have caused unnecessary harm to relationships. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person might be in the wrong (A) because they disclosed private information without the sister's approval, leading to a breakdown in her relationships. However, if the sister was in danger, the answer might differ, but the scenario doesn't mention immediate danger. Therefore, the likely answer is A.\n"
