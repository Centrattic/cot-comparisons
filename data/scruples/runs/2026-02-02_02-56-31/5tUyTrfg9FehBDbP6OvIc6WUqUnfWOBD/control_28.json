I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister had a past relationship where she was abused and possibly pimped. The author thinks it's wrong that the sister didn't tell her current boyfriend about this. The author told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily, leading to a fallout with the sister.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about boundaries and privacy. The author's sister might have chosen not to share her history, perhaps for personal reasons, maybe she felt it wasn't necessary or she wasn't ready. The author, thinking they're doing the right thing by being honest, might have violated the sister's privacy. \n\nAlso, the sister's boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was right to tell him. There's a difference between protecting someone and respecting their autonomy. The sister might have valid reasons for not disclosing her past to her partner, and the author stepping in could have overstepped.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of the author's concern. They might believe that the boyfriend has a right to know something so significant. However, usually, that information should come from the sister herself, not a family member. The author didn't consult with the sister before disclosing it, which could be a breach of trust between siblings.\n\nThe parents' reaction is also interesting. They were unsure if the boyfriend knew, but the author decided to act without their input. The author's intention might have been to protect the boyfriend from being in a potentially harmful situation if the sister was still vulnerable. But again, that's assuming the sister's situation, which the author isn't entirely sure about.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might be wrong because they didn't respect their sister's confidentiality. Even if the author has concerns, they should have addressed it with the sister first, not third parties. The boyfriend's reaction is extreme, but the author's action is still questionable.\n\nSo considering all factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they disclosed private information without consent, which is a violation of privacy and trust. Even with good intentions, the method was inappropriate.\n"
