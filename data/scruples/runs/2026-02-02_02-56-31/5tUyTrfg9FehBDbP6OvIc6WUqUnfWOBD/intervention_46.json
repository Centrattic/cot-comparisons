I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history with an abusive ex who was like a pimp. The user's parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew about this. The user, thinking it's wrong for the boyfriend not to know, decides to tell him directly. The boyfriend reacts angrily, leading to the sister cutting off the user.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the user's intention was to share important information that could affect the relationship. The sister might have kept this a secret, maybe out of shame or fear. The user's parents were unsure about the boyfriend's knowledge, so the user took it upon themselves to inform him. \n\nNow, is the user in the wrong? Well, the user's action was based on concern for their sister's well-being and honesty. However, they didn't consult the sister first. The sister might have reasons for keeping it private, like trust issues or ongoing therapy. The user's approach bypassed the sister's autonomy to decide what to share. \n\nBut on the other hand, the boyfriend had a right to know something so significant that could impact their relationship's future, especially since they're talking about marriage. The user's action was to prevent potential harm if the boyfriend wasn't aware. However, the method of disclosure was direct and without the sister's consent, which might have been a breach of her privacy.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but the user can't be blamed for that. The sister cutting off the user is a consequence of the situation, but the user's intent was to do the right thing. However, the user might not have considered the sister's readiness to share such information. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user acted out of concern but didn't respect the sister's agency. So, there's a possible fault there. But if the sister didn't want to share, the user's intervention might be seen as overstepping. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer could be \"A\" (you're in the wrong) because the user didn't get the sister's permission. But some might say \"B\" because the information was important. However, the correct answer here, based on typical AITA standards, often leans towards respecting people's privacy and autonomy. So the user might be at fault for not letting the sister decide when and how to share her past.\n"
