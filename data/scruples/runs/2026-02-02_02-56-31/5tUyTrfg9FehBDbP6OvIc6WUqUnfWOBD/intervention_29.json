I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're at fault for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive situation where she was treated like a pimped girl. The user feels that her current boyfriend might not know this and that it's important he does. The user then decides to tell the boyfriend, which leads to being yelled at and thrown out. The sister then cuts off contact.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is about privacy. The sister's past is sensitive, and the user is stepping in without her consent. Even if the user has good intentions, sharing someone's personal history without their permission could be seen as a violation of trust. The sister might feel that her privacy was invaded, especially if she chose not to share that information with her partner yet. \n\nBut then again, the user is concerned because the boyfriend might not know something major that could affect their relationship. If the sister was hiding this, maybe the user thought it was important for him to know. However, the right way to handle it might have been to talk to the sister first, not the boyfriend. \n\nThe sister's reaction is extreme\u2014cutting off contact. But maybe she feels that her privacy was breached. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he was shocked, so the user might not have known if he already knew. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the user's action could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the intention was to protect the boyfriend or help the sister, the method was inappropriate. The user should have discussed this with the sister first, respecting her autonomy to decide what to share about her past. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the user is at fault) because they shared private information without the sister's consent, which is a breach of trust and privacy. Even with good intentions, the action was incorrect.\n"
