I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about the abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was pimped. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to be with someone without telling him this. The parents also didn't know if the boyfriend knew. The author went to the boyfriend's place and told him the truth. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped by sharing this information without the sister's consent. On one hand, the author's intention might have been to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who was in an abusive situation. But on the other hand, the sister might have her reasons for not disclosing her past, maybe for her own privacy or because she's healing. The author didn't ask for permission and just went ahead, which could be seen as violating her privacy. Also, the boyfriend's reaction suggests that he might not have known, and the author's action caused a rift in the family.\n\nThe sister's response was cutting off the author completely, which is extreme, but maybe she feels her privacy was invaded. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by being honest, but without considering the sister's agency to decide when and how to share her history. So, it's a balance between transparency and respecting personal boundaries. \n\nI think the key points are the lack of consent from the sister and the potential violation of her privacy. Even if the author had good intentions, sharing such personal information without permission could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
