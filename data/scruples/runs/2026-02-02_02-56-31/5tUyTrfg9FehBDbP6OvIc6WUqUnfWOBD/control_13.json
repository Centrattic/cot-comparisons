I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was a pimp. She's now in a serious relationship with a new guy, and the author thinks it's wrong because he might not know about her past. The author tells the boyfriend, who reacts angrily, and then the sister cuts off the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are confidentiality and boundaries. The sister might have chosen not to tell her boyfriend about her past, which is her right. By sharing that information without her consent, the author breached her privacy. Even if the author's intentions were to protect the boyfriend, the sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her own life is important. \n\nThe author might argue they were trying to help by being honest, but it's not their place to disclose someone else's personal information without permission. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, could be a result of being blindsided. The sister's response is also extreme, but the author's action might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, the author broke the sister's trust by sharing her private history. Even if the author didn't believe the sister's account fully, that's a different issue. The main ethical violation here is the unauthorized disclosure. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
