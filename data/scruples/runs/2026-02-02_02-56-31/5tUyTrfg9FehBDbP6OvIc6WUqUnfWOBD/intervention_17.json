I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive ex. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship and is now in a serious relationship with someone. The user's parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew about this past. The user thought it was wrong to hide such a significant detail, so they decided to inform the boyfriend.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the user acted appropriately. On one hand, the user's intention was to be honest and protect the boyfriend from potential future issues. But on the other hand, the user might have overstepped by revealing personal information without consent. The sister's privacy is a key factor here. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which could indicate that the user's approach was abrupt or lacked sensitivity. Also, the sister cutting off the user is a consequence the user might not have anticipated. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The user's concern for their sister's well-being and the boyfriend's right to know are valid, but the method of disclosure might have been problematic. The user didn't consult with the sister first, which could have led to her feeling betrayed. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user might not be entirely wrong, especially if the information was relevant for the boyfriend's decisions. However, the way it was handled without the sister's consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nConsidering these points, the answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong because they intended to help, but there's a possibility they could have approached it differently. However, depending on cultural or familial norms, some might argue that the user shouldn't have disclosed the information without consent.\n"
