I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the sister's boyfriend being told the truth about her past. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where her ex was like a pimp, and she's now with a new guy they're serious about. The author told the sister's boyfriend about this past without her permission.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to be honest because they thought it was important for the boyfriend to know. They believed the sister was hiding something major, which could affect the relationship. But the sister might see this as a breach of trust. The author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, which made the author feel it was necessary to inform him.\n\nThe boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off the author. Now the author is asking if they're at fault. \n\nI need to consider if the author had the right to share that information. Privacy is a big factor here. The sister might have wanted to disclose her past herself on her own terms. By the author stepping in, they could have violated her privacy, even if their intentions were good. \n\nHowever, the author's concern about the boyfriend not knowing something so significant could be seen as trying to protect their sister. But usually, unless there's an imminent danger or legal obligation, family members aren't supposed to share others' private information without consent. \n\nThe sister's reaction\u2014cutting off the author\u2014shows how hurt she felt. The author's action might have caused more harm than good, even if they thought they were helping. The boyfriend's anger might have been a reaction to being blindsided, but the author still shouldn't have shared the information without the sister's permission.\n\nSo, weighing the intention versus the action, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's autonomy to share her own story. Even with good intentions, sharing someone else's personal history without their consent is a privacy violation. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
