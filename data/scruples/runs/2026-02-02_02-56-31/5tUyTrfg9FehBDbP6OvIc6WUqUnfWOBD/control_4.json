I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong after telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out by her ex. The author believes that the sister's current boyfriend might not know about this history and thinks it's wrong for her to be with him while hiding such a major issue. The author tells the boyfriend directly, which leads to a bad reaction: the boyfriend yells and throws them out. Then, the sister cuts off the author.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent, privacy, and intent. The sister might have kept her past a secret for a reason, maybe she felt it was personal or didn't want to burden the relationship. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend by informing him, but they didn't consult the sister first. Even if the author thought it was the right thing to do, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be seen as a violation of trust, especially within family. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which might indicate that the sister was right to keep it private if revealing it caused more harm. The author's action could have jeopardized the sister's relationship and potentially hurt her further if the boyfriend had a negative reaction. However, if the boyfriend was unaware and the sister was hiding a serious issue, the author might have a point about transparency in relationships. \n\nBut the main issue here is that the author didn't respect the sister's autonomy to share her story on her own terms. Even if the author had good intentions, disclosing such sensitive information without permission can be considered a breach of privacy. The sister's response, cutting off the author, shows that the action was hurtful to her. So, the author likely overstepped their bounds, making them at least partially responsible. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they shared personal information without the sister's consent, leading to negative consequences.\n"
