I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused, which is a serious issue. The user believed that the boyfriend didn't know about this, so they thought it was necessary to tell him the truth. The parents also seemed unsure if the boyfriend knew. The user's intention was to protect their sister, maybe thinking that if the boyfriend didn't know, he might not make an informed decision about marrying her.\n\nBut wait, the sister might have chosen not to disclose that part of her past. By revealing it without her consent, the user might have violated her privacy. Even if the user thought it was for her own good, sharing such personal information without permission can be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which the user didn't expect. The sister then cut off the user, which is a big consequence. The user is now questioning if they overstepped.\n\nSo, the key points are consent and privacy. The user didn't ask the sister if it was okay to share her past with the boyfriend. Even if the intention was good, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be wrong. The sister might have valid reasons for not telling her boyfriend, like fear of rejection or stigma. The user's actions led to the breakup of her relationship and loss of family connection. \n\nHowever, the user's concern for their sister's well-being is understandable. But the method of intervention might have been inappropriate. It's possible that a better approach would be to talk to the sister first, support her in deciding when and how to share her history, rather than disclosing it without her knowledge.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's action was a privacy violation, so they might be in the wrong (Answer A). But the situation is complex, and there's nuance. The sister's choice to hide her past is her own, and the user's intent was protective. However, the right to privacy and autonomy usually takes precedence, so the answer leans towards A.\n"
