I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person told their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The main question is whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused by an ex-boyfriend who was controlling. The person thought it was wrong to keep the new boyfriend in the dark about such a major issue. They believed the boyfriend didn't know and felt it was necessary to tell him because it's a significant factor in any relationship.\n\nBut here's the problem: the sister might have chosen to keep that information private. Maybe she wasn't ready to share it, or perhaps she felt safe with the new boyfriend and didn't want to burden him. The person stepped in without her consent, which could be seen as overstepping. Even if the intention was good, sharing private information without permission can be a breach of trust.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which might indicate he felt blindsided. The sister then cut off the person, which shows she's upset with their intervention. The person's actions might have caused harm by violating the sister's privacy and possibly damaging both relationships.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the person's concern was valid, the method of addressing it was problematic. They should have discussed it with their sister first, offering support instead of disclosing it to the boyfriend. So, the answer is AITA, meaning they are in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy and boundaries.\n"
