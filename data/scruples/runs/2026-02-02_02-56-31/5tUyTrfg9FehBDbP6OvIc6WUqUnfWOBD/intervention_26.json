  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person did the right thing. The situation is complicated because it involves family dynamics, abuse, and personal boundaries.\n\nSo, the sister had a past where she was abused and pimped by a previous boyfriend. Now she's with this new guy, and the person in question told the new boyfriend about this history without the sister's consent. The main question is whether that was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's right to privacy. Even if the sister might have issues with how she remembers her past, sharing that information with her current partner without her permission is a breach of trust. The sister might have reasons for not disclosing her history, maybe she's still healing, or maybe she's not ready. The person stepping in and sharing that could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThen there's the brother's intention. He thought it was wrong to hide such a major issue from the boyfriend. But does he have the right to decide that for her? Even if he's concerned, the appropriate action usually is to talk to the sister first, not go directly to the boyfriend. The sister's autonomy should be respected unless there's immediate danger, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe sister's reaction\u2014cutting off the brother\u2014is extreme, but maybe she feels betrayed. The boyfriend's anger could be due to surprise or feeling that his partner was being judged. However, the brother's method was confrontational, which might have escalated things.\n\nLegally and ethically, sharing someone's personal information without consent is usually a problem. Unless there's a legal duty to report (like if there's ongoing abuse), the brother might have crossed a line. The sister's past is her to disclose, not her sibling to share.\n\nThe parents' uncertainty about the boyfriend knowing the history adds another layer. Maybe the sister wasn't honest with him, but that's their relationship to handle. The brother stepping in without her consent might not be the right approach.\n\nIn summary, while the brother's intentions might be to protect his sister, the method he used was problematic. He should have first discussed the matter with his sister to understand her perspective and encourage her to communicate with her boyfriend directly if needed. By going to the boyfriend, he violated her privacy and trust, leading to the fallout described. Therefore, the answer is likely that he's at fault.\n"
