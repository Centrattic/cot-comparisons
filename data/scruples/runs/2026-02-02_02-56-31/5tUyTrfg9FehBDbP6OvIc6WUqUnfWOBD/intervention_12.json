I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did the right thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. They mentioned their sister was in an abusive relationship before, and now they're with a new guy. The user thought it was wrong for the sister to hide her history, so they told the boyfriend. The boyfriend got angry and threw them out, and now the sister is cutting them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's situation. She was in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp, which is really serious. The user is concerned about her agency in that situation. They might feel that her new boyfriend doesn't know the full story and that it's important for him to know, even though it's not their place to share.\n\nBut wait, there's a line between being concerned and overstepping. The user decided to disclose this personal information without the sister's consent. Even if their intentions were good, sharing someone's private history without their permission can be seen as a violation of trust. The sister might feel that her privacy was breached, especially since she was the one in the new relationship and should have the autonomy to decide when and how to share her past.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme\u2014he yelled and threw the user out. That could be because he was shocked or because he reacted poorly. But the user's action might have caused strain in the sister's relationship. Even if the information is true, the method of disclosure is questionable. The user should have probably talked to their sister first, encouraged her to be honest with her boyfriend, rather than sharing it themselves.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned they're unsure about the sister's account of her agency in the past situation. That's a red flag. If they don't fully believe her story, they might be projecting their own judgments onto her. It's important not to question someone's experience without concrete evidence, especially in cases of abuse.\n\nThe sister cutting the user off is a consequence of this action. The user might have damaged their relationship by overstepping. Even if the intention was to help, the approach was invasive. The parents were also unsure if the boyfriend knew, which adds to the complexity. Maybe the sister chose not to share her past for personal reasons, and the user's disclosure could have done more harm than good.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's action was not their place to make. They should have respected their sister's privacy and autonomy, even if they were concerned. The right approach would have been to support their sister and encourage open communication between her and her boyfriend, not to take matters into their own hands. So, the answer would be that they are in the wrong.\n"
