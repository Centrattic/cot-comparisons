I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. The sister had a history of being abused and controlled by an ex, and the user thought it was wrong for her to keep this from her current boyfriend. The user's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the user took it upon themselves to inform him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut the user off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's intentions. They believed the boyfriend should know about the sister's past because it's a significant issue that could affect their relationship. The user might think they were acting in their sister's best interest, even if the sister didn't share the information. But maybe the sister didn't want that information shared, and the user overstepped by not discussing it with her first.\n\nConfidentiality and consent are important here. The sister's past is her story to tell, and the user's decision to disclose it without her permission might have violated her trust. Even if the user thought it was for the right reasons, sharing personal and sensitive information without consent can be problematic. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, could be due to being blindsided or not knowing how to handle the information. However, the user's approach might have been confrontational or inappropriate, leading to that response. \n\nThe sister cutting off the user could be a result of feeling betrayed. The user might have wanted to protect her or the boyfriend, but the method didn't consider her feelings or autonomy. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The user had good intentions but didn't communicate with their sister first. The sister's agency in her current relationship and her right to decide what to share about her past are crucial factors. The user's actions might have been well-meaning, but the method was flawed. So, the answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's autonomy and privacy.\n"
