I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The scenario is about them telling their sister's boyfriend the truth about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister has a history of being abused by a previous partner who was also a pimp. The sister is currently in a serious relationship with a new boyfriend, and the person (the narrator) thinks that the boyfriend might not know about this past. The parents also aren't sure if the boyfriend knows. The narrator feels that it's wrong for the sister to be in a relationship without disclosing such a major part of her history, which could affect the boyfriend's decision to stay with her.\n\nSo the narrator decides to tell the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacts badly, yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister cuts off the narrator. The question is whether the narrator is in the wrong for intervening.\n\nFrom one angle, the sister's past is a significant part of her history. If the boyfriend didn't know, maybe the sister was hiding it for a reason. The narrator might think they're protecting the boyfriend from being misled, but maybe the sister had her reasons for not sharing\u2014like trauma, fear of judgment, or wanting to move on. \n\nOn the other hand, the narrator's intention was to be honest, which is a good motive. But disclosing someone's private information without their consent can be a breach of trust. The sister might feel that the narrator overstepped by sharing her history without her permission. Even if the narrator believes in transparency, the sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her past is important. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be due to shock, anger at being kept in the dark, or even a reaction to the way the information was delivered. But the narrator didn't get the sister's consent to share this. Even if the information is important, sharing it without the sister's approval can damage trust between siblings.\n\nAdditionally, the sister's response of cutting off the narrator shows how hurt she was. The narrator might have good intentions, but the method was invasive. The sister might need to make her own choices about her relationships, even if they seem unwise from the narrator's perspective. \n\nSo, considering all that, the narrator might be in the wrong because they shared private information without the sister's permission, which is a violation of her privacy and trust. The sister's autonomy in her relationships should be respected, even if the narrator disagrees with her decisions.\n"
