I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about a traumatic part of their sister's past. The sister had a past relationship where she was abused and pimped, and the user felt she wasn't being honest with her current boyfriend. The user's parents also thought the boyfriend might not know that history, so they told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and now the sister is cutting the user off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The sister's past is a sensitive topic. The user might have believed that the boyfriend had a right to know about his partner's history, especially since they were planning to get married. However, the sister might have kept this information private for a reason, maybe to protect herself or because she's still healing. The user's action could be seen as an overstepping of boundaries, even if it was done with good intentions. \n\nBut then again, the boyfriend might not have had the full picture, which could affect their relationship. The user's parents also thought he might not know, so maybe there was a reason to share. However, the user didn't consult the sister first, which could have been a mistake. The sister's autonomy and her right to share her own story on her terms might be important here.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the user's action led to conflict. The sister's response was extreme, cutting off the user after the boyfriend's outburst. The question is whether the user had the right to intervene like that. There's a balance between protecting a loved one's partner's right to know and respecting the sister's privacy and her decision about what to share.\n\nIn some cases, family members might feel the need to protect each other, but it's not always appropriate to disclose personal information without consent. The user might have acted out of concern, but the method was problematic. The key factors here are consent, the sister's right to privacy, and the potential for causing harm. The user might be in the wrong because they didn't get the sister's permission before sharing her history. However, the boyfriend's reaction and the sister's subsequent cutoff could also be seen as overreactions. \n\nI think the answer is tricky, but leaning towards the user being in the wrong because they disclosed sensitive information without the sister's consent, even if the intention was good. So the answer is A.\n"
