I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about their sister's past trauma. The situation involves a sister who had a bad experience with an ex-boyfriend who was abusive and possibly a pimp. The author told the boyfriend about this without the sister's consent, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main issue is whether the author had the right to disclose such personal information. The sister's past is very sensitive, especially involving abuse. The author's parents mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, which adds another layer. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend by letting him know about the sister's history, thinking that most people would be put off by that. But the boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nLegally, there's a question of privacy. The sister's history is her personal information, and sharing it without consent could be a breach of privacy. However, if there's a concern about ongoing harm or manipulation, there might be an argument for intervention. But in this case, the author's sister is currently in a relationship, and the author is stepping in as a concerned sibling.\n\nEthically, the author's decision to disclose without the sister's permission is questionable. Even if the author had good intentions, the sister's autonomy and right to privacy are important. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to surprise or feeling blindsided, which might be a valid response if he was indeed kept in the dark about such a significant aspect of his partner's life. However, the author's approach was direct and without discussing it with the sister first, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe sister's response\u2014cutting off the author\u2014might be extreme, but it's her way of protecting her current relationship. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend might not be fair, especially if the boyfriend's reaction was due to distress rather than malice. The author might have expected a different reaction and perhaps didn't consider the emotional impact of the disclosure.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might have been to protect the boyfriend, the method of disclosure without the sister's consent is problematic. The sister has the right to control her personal information, even if the author has concerns about the relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for violating the sister's privacy, even if the intention was to be helpful.\n"
