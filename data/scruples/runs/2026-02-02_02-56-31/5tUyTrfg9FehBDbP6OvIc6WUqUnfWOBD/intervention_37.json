I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user, the sister's brother, told the sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner, who was essentially her pimp. The user made a comment to their parents about the current boyfriend being good despite the sister's history. The parents then said they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. The user decided to tell the boyfriend directly, which led to a confrontation where the boyfriend yelled and threw them out. The sister cut off the user.\n\nSo, the user is asking if they're in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The sister's abuse history is a sensitive issue. The user's intention was to be truthful, thinking that the boyfriend should know a major aspect of the sister's past that might affect their relationship. However, without the sister's consent, sharing such personal information could be seen as violating her privacy. The sister might have chosen not to disclose that part of her past to her current partner for various reasons\u2014maybe she's not ready, or she wants to move on. By the user telling the boyfriend, it disrupted the sister's autonomy in deciding what to share.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was negative, which the user anticipated, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action. The sister's response of cutting off the user is a result of feeling betrayed. The user's action, while coming from a place of concern, might have overstepped by not respecting the sister's boundaries regarding her personal history.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue that the boyfriend should know about a significant potential red flag in the relationship. However, the ethical issue here is the unauthorized disclosure of personal information. Even with good intentions, sharing such details without consent can be harmful. The sister's right to privacy and control over her narrative is important. The user's parents might have contributed to the pressure, but the final decision to act was the user's. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user's action directly led to the conflict. The boyfriend was informed without the sister's approval, which could have caused more harm than good. The sister might now feel that her past is being used against her or that her current partner is being manipulated. The user might be in the wrong for not considering the sister's autonomy and for meddling in her relationship without her consent. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, might be a result of feeling blindsided, but that doesn't make the user right. \n\nConsidering all this, the user likely acted in the wrong by disclosing sensitive information without consent, even if the intention was to protect the sister or the boyfriend. The answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
