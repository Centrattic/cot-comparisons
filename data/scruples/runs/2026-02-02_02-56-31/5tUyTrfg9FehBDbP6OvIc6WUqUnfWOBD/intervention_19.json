I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive ex, which their parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware of. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp, and now she's serious with a new guy.\n\nThe user thought it was wrong to keep this from him, considering it's a major issue that might affect the relationship. They told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily. Then when the user asked for an apology from the boyfriend, the sister cut off their relationship. The user is now wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's privacy is a big factor here. The user's intent was to protect their sister from a potential bad relationship by being honest with her partner. However, sharing such personal information without consent could be seen as a violation of trust. Even if the user thought it was for her own good, the sister might feel betrayed by her sibling.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was harsh. Yelling and throwing the user out isn't a healthy response, but maybe he was shocked and didn't handle it well. The user's action might be seen as well-intentioned but misguided. They crossed a boundary by disclosing private information without the sister's permission, which typically isn't the role of a third party, even a relative, to do.\n\nThe sister's reaction to cutting off the user could be because she felt her privacy was invaded. The user might have assumed they were helping, but the sister might see it as meddling. The parents not being sure if the boyfriend knew adds complexity. But the user's responsibility isn't necessarily to inform the partner unless the sister explicitly asked for help.\n\nIn relationships, partners are generally expected to communicate such personal histories themselves. The user's intervention bypassed the sister's choice, which can be a problem. Even if the sister didn't share the truth, the user's action might have undermined her autonomy and led to conflict.\n\nSo, the user's intentions might be good, but the action of revealing private information without consent is where the issue lies. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the user is in the wrong) because they overstepped by disclosing personal details without the sister's permission, leading to the fallout.\n"
