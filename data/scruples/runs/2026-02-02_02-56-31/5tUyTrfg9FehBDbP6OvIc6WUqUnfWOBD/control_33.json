I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about telling a sister's boyfriend the truth about her past. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was like a pimp. She's now with a new guy, and the author thinks it's wrong she hasn't told him about this history. The author then confronts the boyfriend, who reacts angrily, leading to a fallout with the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to tell the truth because they believed the boyfriend had a right to know something major that could affect their relationship. But did the author have the right to disclose this information without the sister's consent? Privacy is a big factor. The sister might have her reasons for not sharing her past, maybe she's trying to move on or protect herself. The author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, which raises the question of whether the author assumed that secrecy was a bad thing. \n\nThen there's the method of disclosure. The author went directly to the boyfriend and told him, leading to a hostile reaction. Was that the right approach? Maybe the author should have first talked to the sister, not the boyfriend. If the sister chose not to share her past, even after the author's concerns, the author might have overstepped by going around her. \n\nAlso, the sister's response was cutting off the author. That's a strong reaction, but maybe she felt her privacy was violated. The boyfriend's anger could be due to being told about his girlfriend's past by someone else, which can feel like a betrayal. \n\nThe author's justification is that the boyfriend should know the truth to make an informed decision. However, the author didn't confirm whether the boyfriend was unaware or not. The parents' uncertainty suggests they didn't know for sure. So, the author acted on an assumption that the boyfriend wasn't informed, which might not have been accurate. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, everyone has a right to their privacy. The author's sister might have wanted to disclose her history on her own terms. By revealing it without her consent, the author breached that trust. Even with good intentions, sharing someone else's personal information without their permission is a breach of confidentiality. \n\nMoreover, the author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend complicates things. It's possible the boyfriend was upset because he felt blindsided, not because he didn't know. The author's approach might have been confrontational without giving the boyfriend a chance to process the information. \n\nIn summary, while the author's concern might be valid, the method and lack of consent in sharing sensitive information likely led to the conflict. The author didn't respect the sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her past. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
