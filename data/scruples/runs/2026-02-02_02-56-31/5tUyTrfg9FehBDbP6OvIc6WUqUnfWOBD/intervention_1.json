I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive ex. The situation involves some complex family dynamics and personal boundaries.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, described as being treated like a pimped woman, which is serious. The user made a comment to their parents about the boyfriend being good despite that history. The parents then mentioned they weren't sure if he knew about the past. The user felt it was wrong for the sister to keep this from her current boyfriend and decided to tell him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the user.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the user have the right to disclose the sister's private information? The user's reasoning was that the boyfriend should know about the sister's past to make an informed decision. However, the sister may have kept that information private for a reason. The user's actions could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the sister had not shared that history with her partner. The boyfriend's negative reaction might be due to surprise, anger, or a desire to protect his partner, but the user's intention was to be honest.\n\nOn the ethical side, there's a conflict between honesty and respecting privacy. The user might believe they were protecting the boyfriend from being misled, while the sister and her partner might view the disclosure as an invasion of privacy. The user's approach was direct and might not have considered the sister's wishes or the potential fallout. The sister's response cutting off the user suggests that the user overstepped in her personal life.\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but morally, it's a gray area. The user's actions were unauthorized by the sister, which could be seen as violating her autonomy. Even if the user's intentions were good, the method was confrontational and may have disregarded the sister's right to decide who gets to know her history. The boyfriend's right to know is valid, but the sister's right to control her narrative is also important. The user might not have considered alternative ways to address this, like talking to the sister first to understand her perspective or encouraging her to be honest with the boyfriend herself.\n\nIn summary, the user acted out of concern but without the sister's consent, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The sister's decision to cut off the user indicates that she felt her privacy was violated. Therefore, the user is likely in the wrong for not respecting her sister's autonomy and for intervening directly without seeking her input.\n"
