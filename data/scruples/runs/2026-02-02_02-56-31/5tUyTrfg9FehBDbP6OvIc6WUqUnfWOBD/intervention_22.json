I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history with a previous partner who was abusive and possibly a pimp. The user believes their sister might not have been truthful about her role in that situation. The parents mentioned they weren't sure if the current boyfriend knew about this history. The user then decided to tell the boyfriend, leading to a conflict where he yelled and threw them out. The sister then cut off the user.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The sister might have withheld important information from her partner, which could affect his decision to stay in the relationship. The user felt it was wrong for the sister to keep this secret. However, the user's approach was direct\u2014telling the boyfriend without consulting the sister first. This could be seen as violating confidentiality, even if the user's intent was to protect their sister's partner.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's past is a sensitive issue. The user's action might have been meant to prevent future harm if the boyfriend wasn't aware. However, the way it was handled was confrontational and led to a hostile reaction. The user didn't consider the sister's consent to share this information, which is a key factor in maintaining trust and boundaries within family.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but the user might not be entirely at fault for the outcome. However, the method of disclosure was problematic. The user should have perhaps approached the sister first to discuss sharing the information, rather than going straight to the boyfriend. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user's intent was to do the right thing, but the execution lacked consideration for privacy and family dynamics. So, there's a mix of right and wrong here. But since the user acted without the sister's consent, it's more likely they overstepped, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
