I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about their sister's past trauma with an abusive ex. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister has been in a serious relationship for over a year, possibly planning marriage. The author feels that the sister is hiding her history of abuse and being pimped by her ex. The parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so the author decided to inform him directly. The boyfriend reacted badly, yelling and throwing the author out. Then the sister cut off the author after they asked for an apology from the boyfriend.\n\nNow, considering ethics and boundaries. The author's intention was to be honest because they believed the boyfriend wasn't aware of the sister's past. However, the sister might have chosen to keep that information private. By bypassing the sister and sharing it directly with the boyfriend, the author potentially violated the sister's privacy. Even if the author's concern was genuine, the method of disclosure might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the sister's agency is a factor. The author is unsure if the sister had control in her previous situation, but that's her story to tell. The author's judgment about her past could be clouding the situation. The key issue here is the breach of confidentiality. The author didn't consult the sister before sharing her history, which is a big privacy issue. Even if the intention was to protect the sister from a potential bad situation, the way it was handled was intrusive.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the author's action might have caused unnecessary conflict. The sister's response, cutting off the author, shows the impact of the disclosure. The author now has to consider whether their action was justified despite the outcome.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the wrong for sharing personal information without consent. Even with good intentions, respecting someone's privacy is crucial. Unless there's a clear risk of harm that requires immediate action, which isn't specified here, the author overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
