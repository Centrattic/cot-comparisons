I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about their sister's history of being abused. The sister had a previous relationship where she was abused and controlled, and now she's with a new guy they think is serious. The person felt that hiding such a major past issue was wrong and decided to tell the boyfriend. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of sharing someone's personal information. The sister's history is very sensitive. Did the person have the right to disclose that without her consent? Even if they thought it was for her good, sharing such details could be a violation of privacy.\n\nThen, the parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so maybe the sister had kept it a secret. The person's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being misled, but by doing so, they might have overstepped. The sister's autonomy is important\u2014she might have valid reasons for not telling everyone, or perhaps she's recovering and doesn't want to relive the trauma.\n\nThe way the person approached it also matters. Confronting the boyfriend directly without the sister's knowledge could be seen as interfering. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, might be due to shock or feeling betrayed, but that doesn't justify his actions. The sister cutting off contact is a strong reaction, but maybe she felt her privacy was invaded.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the person should have approached the sister first, encouraged her to be honest with the boyfriend, rather than taking it upon themselves to disclose. That way, the sister has agency in sharing her story. By doing it themselves, they might have undermined her trust and control over her own narrative.\n\nAlso, the person's doubt about the sister's agency in the previous situation adds complexity. If they truly believe the sister might be in a harmful situation again, that's a different angle. But using their judgment to expose the sister's past without her consent could be seen as overstepping, especially if the sister is in a healthier relationship now.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the person might have acted with good intentions but crossed a boundary. The sister's right to privacy and autonomy is key here. Therefore, the answer might be AITA A, meaning the person is at fault for disclosing without consent.\n"
