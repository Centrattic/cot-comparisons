I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused by her ex, who was also her pimp. The author believed the sister might be hiding her lack of agency in that situation. The parents mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew about the abuse. The author felt it was wrong that the boyfriend was in a serious relationship without this info, so they told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to protect the sister and the boyfriend by informing him about her past. However, the sister's privacy is a factor here. She might have chosen not to disclose that part of her history, so the author shared something personal without her consent. Even if the author had good intentions, sharing such sensitive information without permission can be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has a right to know about his partner's significant past trauma, especially since they're planning marriage. The author might have thought it was necessary for the boyfriend's informed consent. But the method of disclosure was direct and possibly confrontational, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points are consent and the right to privacy versus the right to know. The author didn't consult the sister first, which could be why she felt betrayed. While the information is important, sharing it without her approval might have crossed a line. The boyfriend's reaction, though harsh, might indicate he felt the information was shared inappropriately.\n\nSo, the author's action was well-intentioned but possibly overstepped by not respecting the sister's autonomy to share her past when she's ready. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
