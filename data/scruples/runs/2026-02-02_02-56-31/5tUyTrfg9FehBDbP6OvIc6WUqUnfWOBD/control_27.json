I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the abuse is in the wrong. So, the sister had a past abusive relationship, which her current boyfriend might not know about. The author thought it was wrong that the boyfriend didn't know this major detail and decided to tell him. The boyfriend reacted badly, yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's right to privacy. Did the author have the right to disclose such personal information without the sister's consent? Maybe the sister had chosen not to share that part of her history, perhaps for her own reasons. The author might have thought they were protecting their sister or the boyfriend, but by doing so, they overstepped. \n\nAlso, the author's judgment about their sister's agency in the past situation might be a red flag. Maybe the sister is still healing and didn't want to revisit that trauma. The author's decision to intervene could have caused more harm than good. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, could be a result of being blindsided by unexpected information. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the sister's current boyfriend was genuinely unaware of her past, maybe the author had a point in thinking that the boyfriend should know to make an informed decision. However, the method of disclosure was direct and without the sister's consent, which complicates things. \n\nThe key points here are consent, privacy, and intention. The author's intention might have been to help, but without the sister's permission, they violated her privacy. Even if the information was sensitive, sharing it without her consent could be seen as wrong. The sister cutting off the author is a consequence of feeling betrayed. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely acted without respecting their sister's autonomy, leading to the fallout. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
