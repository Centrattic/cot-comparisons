I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner, which the user believes her current boyfriend might not know about. The user's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the user took it upon themselves to tell him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the user.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The user's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship without knowing the sister's history. However, the sister might have chosen not to disclose that information for a reason. The user's action of revealing this without the sister's consent could be seen as an invasion of her privacy. Even if the user thought it was for the boyfriend's good, sharing someone's personal and sensitive information without their permission is generally considered a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue that the boyfriend had a right to know about her past abuse, especially since they're serious about marriage. But the user's approach was direct and without the sister's approval. The sister's reaction, cutting off the user, shows how hurt she felt by the betrayal. The boyfriend's anger could be a result of feeling that his boundaries were violated or that the information was shared without consent.\n\nIn relationships, it's usually expected that significant issues are discussed between the partners themselves. The user stepping in to reveal such sensitive information might have been well-intentioned but crossed a line. The key issue here is the lack of consent from the sister. Even if the user's parents were concerned, it's not their role to decide to share someone else's private history without their input.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the user likely overstepped by sharing their sister's personal information without her permission. That makes them at fault here. The answer should be A, meaning they are in the wrong.\n"
