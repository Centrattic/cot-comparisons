I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by telling her sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, the sister was in a serious relationship, and the author felt the boyfriend should know about her history with an abusive ex who was essentially her pimp. The author's parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware. The author confronted the boyfriend, leading to a bad reaction.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's sister had a traumatic past that could affect the relationship. The author stepped in because she believed the boyfriend wasn't being informed of something major. But the sister and her boyfriend reacted negatively, cutting the author off.\n\nNow, considering ethics, the author might have had good intentions. She thought the boyfriend should know about the sister's past to make an informed decision. However, the sister might have wanted to keep that part private. The author didn't consult the sister first, which could be a breach of privacy. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was intense, possibly because he felt blindsided or didn't handle the information well. The author's request for an apology from the boyfriend could be seen as adding pressure. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, there's a balance between protecting someone and respecting their autonomy. The author might not be entirely at fault for wanting transparency, but she did go against her sister's wishes by not discussing it with her first. So, the answer might depend on cultural or personal values regarding privacy versus being informed.\n"
