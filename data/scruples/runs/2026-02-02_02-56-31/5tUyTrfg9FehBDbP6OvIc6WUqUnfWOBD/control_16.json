I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. The sister had a history where her ex-boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp. The author overheard the parents not sure if the boyfriend knew this, and thought it was wrong for the sister to be with him without disclosing that. Then the author went to the boyfriend's apartment, told him the truth, which caused a big reaction, and now the sister is cutting the author off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of sharing someone else's private information. The sister's past is a personal matter. The author might have thought they were protecting their sister by being honest with the boyfriend, but did they have the right to do that without the sister's consent? \n\nIn many cases, people have a right to privacy, especially regarding traumatic experiences. Even if the author suspects the sister isn't being entirely truthful about her agency in the past situation, that's still the sister's story to tell. The author stepping in and revealing that information to the boyfriend could be seen as a violation of trust. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but the method of disclosure was direct and without the sister's permission. The sister then feels betrayed and cuts off the author, which is a common reaction when someone shares private details without consent.\n\nAnother angle: the author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so maybe the author thought it was their responsibility to inform him. However, that's assuming the author knows what's best for the relationship. Relationships are complicated, and what one person considers necessary information might be seen as an invasion by others. The sister might have chosen to move on and not want that part of her life brought up. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's judgment about the sister's agency. The author isn't sure if the sister is being honest about her past, but that's not their place to question. The sister's experience is hers to share, and the author's assumption might be projecting their own views onto her situation. \n\nIn terms of the outcome, the author's actions led to a fallout with both the boyfriend and the sister. Even if the intention was good\u2014trying to protect their sister\u2014it's possible that the author overstepped. The sister's decision to cut ties suggests that she felt her privacy was violated.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author did something that, while maybe well-intentioned, crossed a line by sharing confidential information without the sister's consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
