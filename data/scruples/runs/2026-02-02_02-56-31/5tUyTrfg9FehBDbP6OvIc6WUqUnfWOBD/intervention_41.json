  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her\nMy sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past. The sister was in an abusive relationship, and the user thinks the boyfriend didn't know. They told him, which led to a confrontation, and now the sister is cutting them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from different angles. The sister's privacy is a big factor. Even if the sister's past is significant, was it her right to disclose that information to the boyfriend? Consent is key here. The sister might not have wanted that information shared, so the user might have violated her trust.\n\nNext, the user's intention. They might have thought they were protecting their sister or the boyfriend by being honest. But the way they went about it could be problematic. Instead of talking to the sister first to get her perspective or consent, they went straight to the boyfriend. That could be seen as overstepping boundaries.\n\nAlso, the sister's agency in her past situation is questioned by the user. The user isn't sure if the sister had as little control as she claims. This is a private matter, and the user's judgment might not be their place. It's possible the sister is still healing and didn't want that part of her history exposed.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive, but the user's action led to that. Even if the boyfriend overreacted, the initial breach of privacy was on the user. Relationships are about trust, and the sister might feel that trust was broken by the user sharing her past without her permission.\n\nIn terms of family dynamics, the user might have felt they were acting in the sister's best interest, but the method was inappropriate. The sister now cutting them off is a strong reaction, but it's a consequence of the user's actions. The user might need to reflect on whether they had the right to disclose such personal information and whether they should have discussed it with the sister first.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the user likely did something wrong by disclosing their sister's private history without her consent. The answer would be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
