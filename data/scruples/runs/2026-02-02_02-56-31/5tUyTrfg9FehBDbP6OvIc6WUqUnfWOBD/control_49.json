I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she claims her ex was a pimp and she had little agency. The author feels that the current boyfriend should know about this because it's a major issue that might affect their relationship. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend knew, so the author took it upon themselves to tell him.\n\nThe sister's boyfriend reacted negatively, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut the author off. Now the author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: intention behind the action, breach of trust, and the consequences. The author's intention was to protect their sister by ensuring her partner was aware of her past, which could impact their relationship. However, the sister might have chosen to keep that information private, either because she's not ready to share it or doesn't want to burden her partner. The author's action could be seen as overstepping by sharing personal information without consent. But on the other hand, the author might believe it's important for the boyfriend to know for his own safety and to make an informed decision.\n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing someone's private information without their permission is generally a breach of trust. Even if the intention is good, the method might be problematic. The boyfriend's negative reaction suggests that the information was unexpected, which the author might have considered by first discussing with the sister. The sister's response indicates she feels betrayed because the boyfriend was told without her consent. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that the severity of the situation (past abuse) justifies the action. But legally and ethically, without the sister's consent, the author crossed a boundary. The boyfriend now has the information, but the way it was delivered caused conflict. The sister's reaction shows that the author's approach hurt their relationship.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because sharing sensitive information without consent can damage trust, even with good intentions.\n"
