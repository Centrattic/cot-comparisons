I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about a past abusive relationship. The sister had a history of being abused by an ex who was basically her pimp. The author mentioned this to their parents, who weren't sure if the current boyfriend knew. Then the author went to the boyfriend and told him the truth, leading to a confrontation where the boyfriend yelled and threw them out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's sister had a traumatic past, and the author is concerned about keeping it hidden from the current boyfriend. The key question is whether the author had the right to disclose this information without the sister's consent. \n\nOn one hand, the author might believe that the boyfriend has a right to know about a significant past relationship that involved abuse, especially since they're considering marriage. The sister might not have shared this information, possibly due to embarrassment or fear of rejection. The author could feel that this omission is a serious issue affecting the relationship's future.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might see her past as private and not want it disclosed without her permission. The author's action could be seen as a violation of her privacy. Even if the author had good intentions, sharing such personal information without consent can damage trust within family relationships. The boyfriend's reaction, though harsh, might be a result of feeling betrayed by the sister or the author overstepping.\n\nAlso, the author's approach might have been confrontational. Instead of discussing it with the sister first to understand her perspective, they went directly to the boyfriend. This could have been done in a more sensitive way. The sister's response cutting off the author suggests that the disclosure was not only unwelcome but possibly hurtful.\n\nSo, while the author's motive was to protect the boyfriend from being unaware of a significant history, the method of disclosure was problematic. The sister's autonomy over her personal information is a key factor here. Unless there was immediate danger, the author might have been wrong to intervene without the sister's consent. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they disclosed private information without permission, which can harm both the sister and the relationship.\n"
