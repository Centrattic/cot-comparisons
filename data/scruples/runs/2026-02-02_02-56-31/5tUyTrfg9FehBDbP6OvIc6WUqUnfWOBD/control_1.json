I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to be in a serious relationship without the boyfriend knowing this. The author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the author decided to tell him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister then cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications of the author's actions. The key issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose the sister's private information without her consent. The sister's past is sensitive and personal. By sharing it, the author might have violated her privacy. Even if the author's intentions were good\u2014thinking the boyfriend should know the truth\u2014it's important to respect the sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her own life.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the boyfriend being unaware of such a significant part of the sister's history might affect their relationship. However, the author didn't consult the sister first, which is a big factor. Without her consent, disclosing such information can be seen as overstepping boundaries. The author's parents might have had their doubts, but it's still the sister's choice to make.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which could indicate that he wasn't prepared for this information. The author's action might have caused unnecessary harm to the relationship. Even if the author believed the boyfriend should know, the method of disclosure\u2014without the sister's approval\u2014was problematic. The sister's response of cutting off the author shows that the action deeply hurt her, which suggests that the author's actions were not appropriate.\n\nSo, the main points are: respect for privacy, lack of consent from the sister, and the potential harm caused. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they disclosed sensitive information without the sister's permission, leading to negative consequences.\n"
