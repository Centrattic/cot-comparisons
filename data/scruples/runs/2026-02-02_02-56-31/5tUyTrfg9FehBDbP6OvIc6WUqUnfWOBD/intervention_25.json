I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her abusive past. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of being abused by an ex who was also a pimp. The user mentioned this to their parents, who then expressed uncertainty if the current boyfriend knew. The user felt that the sister was hiding this major issue from her new partner, which is a valid concern. But the user took it upon themselves to inform the boyfriend directly without consulting the sister first. \n\nNow, the boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the user. The user is now seeking validation on whether they did the right thing. \n\nFrom a confidentiality standpoint, the user didn't have the sister's consent to share her personal history. That's a red flag. Even if the user had good intentions, disclosing someone's private information without their permission can be a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, the sister was in a serious relationship planning for marriage. Withholding information about past abuse might have ethical implications, as it's important for a partner to know such things. But the right way to handle it would be for the sister to share her own story, not for a family member to do it without her consent. \n\nThe user's actions crossed a boundary, even if their intent was to protect the boyfriend. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt violated by the information, which the user shouldn't have shared. The sister's response cutting off the user might be an overreaction, but the user's initial action of not respecting her privacy is problematic. \n\nSo, balancing the intent to protect vs. the method, the user is at fault for breaching confidentiality. They should have discussed this with the sister first, not the boyfriend. Therefore, the answer would be AITA: A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
