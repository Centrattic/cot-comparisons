I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The situation is a bit tricky.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but maybe not officially invited. The host tried a couple of times to help him integrate\u2014talking to him, introducing him to someone, suggesting games. The guest kept being alone, even after being given opportunities. The host got annoyed because the guest seemed passive and didn't make an effort. Then the host told him to leave.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the host's responsibility. They did try to help, but maybe they shouldn't have given up? Or maybe the guest had a right to be there even if he didn't socialize. But if the guest was a plus one, maybe he wasn't expected to be the center of attention. The host is responsible for the party's atmosphere, so if someone is causing discomfort or not participating, removing them could be justified.\n\nWait, but was it the host's decision to kick him out? If the guest was a friend of a coworker, the coworker might be upset. The host explained their reasoning to the coworker, and the coworker thought it was harsh. So the host might have overstepped by removing the guest without consulting the coworker first. On the other hand, the host is in charge of their own party.\n\nI think it's a judgment call. The host did make an effort but maybe the guest had valid reasons for being awkward. However, the host has the right to set boundaries. If the guest was disrupting the event, it's reasonable to ask to leave. But maybe the host could have handled it more gracefully. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because they tried to help and then set a boundary. But some might argue A because it's not the host's job to make everyone talk. Hmm. I think B is more likely the correct answer here.\n"
