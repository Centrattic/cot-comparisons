I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the host had a party, a guest came with a coworker but maybe wasn't officially invited. The guest stood around awkwardly, was approached by the host twice to help him socialize, tried to talk to someone, then went back to being alone. The host suggested joining a game and mingling, but the guest refused. Then the host told him to leave.\n\nSo, the key points here. The host made an effort to help the guest integrate. They initiated conversations, introduced him to others, made suggestions. The guest, on the other hand, didn't take the initiative. Even after being helped, he went back to standing alone. The host's main point is that the guest wasn't making an effort and was just expecting others to do the work. The host then asked him to leave because they couldn't spend all night dragging him around.\n\nNow, considering the host's responsibility. It's their party, so they have the right to set boundaries. If a guest is not making an effort to socialize and is becoming a burden, the host isn't obligated to keep them around. The guest might have been introverted or uncomfortable, but that doesn't mean the host has to force interactions. The host tried twice to help, and after the guest's lack of response, it's reasonable to ask them to leave, especially if the host is managing other guests and activities.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest was genuinely struggling to connect, but they never made another attempt. The host's approach, while firm, was after multiple attempts to assist. The coworker friend (his plus one) criticized the host, but the host explained their reasoning. In such cases, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong if they've made efforts to include and the guest still isn't engaging. The host's party, their right to manage the environment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They tried to help, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the host has the authority to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing to the social environment and are causing discomfort.\n"
