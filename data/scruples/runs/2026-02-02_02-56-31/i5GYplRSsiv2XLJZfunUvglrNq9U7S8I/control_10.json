I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party and a guest (a friend of a coworker) came along. The guest seemed to be left out and approached the host twice about not being talked to. The host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but the guest didn't engage. Then the host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker (the guest's friend) was upset about it.\n\nSo, the host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort, just wanted attention, and the host didn't have time to help further. The question is whether this was right or wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The host's responsibility is to make guests feel welcome, but also to manage the party's environment. The guest was clearly struggling socially, but maybe the host's approach was a bit harsh. The guest might have social anxiety or just be shy. Insisting that he leave might come off as insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the host isn't responsible for forcing interactions. The guest had opportunities to engage and refused. The host tried to help, so maybe they have a point. But telling someone to leave because they're not socializing could be rude. Parties aren't supposed to make people uncomfortable. The host might have handled it better by offering another suggestion or checking in later instead of kicking him out.\n\nThe coworker friend felt it was \"shitty,\" which suggests that the host's approach might not be well-received by others. Maybe the host could have been more patient or given the guest more time. Also, the guest was a plus one, so maybe the host didn't have an obligation to ensure he was included beyond initial help.\n\nBut the host did make an effort, and after repeated refusals to engage, maybe they had the right to ask him to leave, especially if it was affecting the party's atmosphere. It's a balance between being hospitable and not overextending themselves.\n\nI think the host's actions might have been a bit abrupt. A better approach could have been to suggest another activity or let the guest stay quietly if they preferred. However, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong because the guest wasn't making any effort. The answer might depend on cultural norms or expectations about social gatherings. In some contexts, the host has the right to set the tone and manage the environment.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to help, but when the guest refused to engage, they had the right to ask him to leave. The key is whether the host acted unreasonably. Since the guest was being passive and the host had already offered assistance, it's more the guest's issue. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
