I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because he wasn't socializing. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one of a coworker but came separately, started feeling left out. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting he join a game. But the guest kept standing alone and refused to engage further. The host then told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it. The host is now asking if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the host have a reasonable expectation for the guest to socialize? Was the host's action of asking the guest to leave justified given the circumstances? Also, considering the guest's behavior, was it appropriate for the host to intervene?\n\nI need to consider both sides. The host's perspective: They were hosting a party where socializing is expected. They made attempts to include the guest, but when he continued to isolate himself despite efforts, the host felt it was too much to keep managing. The host might be frustrated that the guest wasn't making an effort, which could affect the overall atmosphere of the party.\n\nThe guest's perspective: He might have felt awkward or shy, but he did mention he wasn't being talked to. However, he didn't reciprocate the efforts made to include him. The host's action might seem harsh, especially if the guest didn't have the same social expectations or felt uncomfortable.\n\nSocial norms: Hosting a party often comes with an unspoken expectation that guests will participate. However, forcing someone to stay if they're not engaging is different from politely asking them to leave if they're not contributing. The host did make attempts to integrate the guest, so it's a matter of whether those efforts were sufficient and if the guest's refusal to engage was a valid reason for removal.\n\nPossible angles to consider: The host is responsible for the event's environment. If a guest is causing discomfort or not participating, it's their call to manage that. However, did the host give enough time or opportunities for the guest to adjust? The host acted after a couple of attempts, which might be reasonable. On the other hand, maybe the host could have handled it more gently, like a private talk instead of a public dismissal.\n\nAlso, the guest's plus one status might play a role. If he wasn't officially invited, the host might have less obligation. But the coworker friend was upset, indicating the guest might be important to her, so the host's action affected her as well.\n\nIn conclusion, the host made good-faith efforts to include the guest, but when those didn't work, they took action. It's a judgment call, but the host isn't necessarily in the wrong because they can set boundaries for their own party. The guest's refusal to engage might have justified the host's decision. So, the answer is B, the host is not in the wrong.\n"
