I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is a party where a guest is being kicked out for not socializing. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a friend of a coworker and came separately. The host noticed him standing alone and even tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. But after that, the guest was alone again, refused to join activities like a game of UNO, and seemed to want others to make an effort for him. The host then told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about that.\n\nHmm, the host did make initial efforts to include the guest. The guest, however, didn't reciprocate by trying to socialize on his own. The host's main responsibility is to manage the party and ensure everyone has a good time, not to force interactions. If someone is uncomfortable, they can choose to leave, but the host isn't obligated to baby-sit someone who isn't making an effort. \n\nI think the key here is whether the host acted unreasonably. The guest didn't try to engage after being introduced, so the host was justified in asking him to leave if he wasn't contributing to the social environment. The host isn't in the wrong because they provided help and then had to enforce some boundaries to keep the party functional. The answer is B.\n"
