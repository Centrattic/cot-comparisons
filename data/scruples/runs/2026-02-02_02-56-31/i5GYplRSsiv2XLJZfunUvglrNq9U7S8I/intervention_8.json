I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the guest wasn't their own invitee; he was a friend of a coworker who came separately. The host noticed the guest was standing around awkwardly and offered help. They introduced him to someone with similar interests, but he ended up alone again. The host tried again, suggested joining a game, but the guest refused. Then the host told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nSo, the host's perspective is that the guest didn't make an effort to socialize, kept complaining about being ignored when he had been talked to, and refused to engage. The host felt they couldn't spend all night dragging him around. The coworker thought it was mean, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nNow, to assess if the host was in the wrong. Social gatherings can vary in social dynamics, but hosting a party means managing the environment. If someone is making themselves uncomfortable by not engaging despite being offered help, it's understandable the host might feel frustrated. However, kicking someone out might be seen as harsh. But the host did try multiple times to help the guest fit in. The guest's behavior might have been passive-aggressive or overly dependent. \n\nBut the host's responsibility is to ensure the event runs smoothly for everyone. If one person is causing stress or not contributing to the social aspect, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The host's actions were after several failed attempts to integrate the guest. So, maybe the host isn't at fault. But some might argue that the host should have handled it more gracefully, like asking the coworker to intervene instead of directly sending the guest away. However, given the context, the host's actions might be justified.\n"
