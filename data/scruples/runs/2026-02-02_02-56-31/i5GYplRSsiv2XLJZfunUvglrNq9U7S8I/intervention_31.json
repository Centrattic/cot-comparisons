I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: they had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came in as a plus one but wasn't really a plus one, just a friend of a coworker. The user noticed the guest was awkwardly standing around. They tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest kept being alone. When the user suggested socializing activities, the guest refused. Then the user told him to leave if he wasn't going to engage.\n\nSo the key points here are: Did the user have the right to ask him to leave? Was the guest being unreasonable? The user tried to integrate him but he didn't make an effort. The guest claimed no one was talking to him even after being introduced. The user's friend (the coworker) was upset about the ejection.\n\nPossible angles: Hosting a party comes with responsibility, but guests also have a social role. If someone isn't engaging and is being passive, the host might feel it's disruptive. But is it the host's responsibility to ensure every guest is included? Or is it the guest's responsibility to make an effort?\n\nThe guest might have social anxiety, but that's not stated. The user tried to help, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The user's frustration is understandable if they're managing the event. However, telling someone to leave could be seen as harsh, especially if the guest had valid reasons for not socializing.\n\nBut the user also mentions that the guest was being passive, not making an effort. The host's time is limited, and they can't be responsible for every guest's social interactions. The user's action might be justified if the guest was creating an awkward environment. On the other hand, maybe the user should have given him more time or a different approach.\n\nIn similar situations, people often debate whether the host is being inconsiderate or enforcing social boundaries. The key is whether the guest was actively causing harm or just not participating. Since the guest wasn't disruptive but just not engaging, the host's action could be seen as too strict. But if the host is tired of trying to include someone who isn't interested, it's a call between being considerate versus setting boundaries.\n\nThe coworker friend's reaction might indicate that the user was too harsh, but the user has their reasons. The answer might hinge on whether the host is expected to facilitate every guest's social interactions versus allowing guests to choose their level of participation. The user might not be in the wrong because the guest wasn't making an effort, and the host has the right to manage their event. So probably answer B (Not in the wrong).\n"
