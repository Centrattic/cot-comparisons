I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, the setup: The host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. He was awkward and claimed no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone, but he ended up alone again. The guest refused suggestions to join games or mingle. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset, but the host defended their decision.\n\nNow, to evaluate if the host is at fault. The key points here are the guest's behavior and the host's actions. The guest seemed to be passive, not making an effort to engage despite being given opportunities. The host made multiple attempts to include him but eventually decided to ask him to leave when he wasn't contributing and perhaps was disrupting the event.\n\nLegally, hosting a private event, the host can set boundaries. Socially, it's a bit more nuanced. The guest might have felt awkward, but taking responsibility for socializing is part of attending a party. The host isn't obligated to force interactions. However, the host did make efforts to include the guest before deciding to remove him.\n\nPossible angles: The host might be seen as being rude for not giving more chances, but on the other hand, they were managing their own event. The guest's entitlement to stay without contributing could be a factor. Since the host explained their reasoning and the coworker was the one who invited him, maybe the host isn't entirely in the wrong. The line between being a good host and not enabling someone's social passivity is thin here. \n\nConsidering all that, the host's action seems justified. They tried inclusion and then set a boundary. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
