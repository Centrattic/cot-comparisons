  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For kicking a guest out of my party for not socializing?\nThis past Friday, I had a party at my house. I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user had a party and a guest was being awkward. They tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else, but he kept isolating himself. The user got annoyed and told him to leave. The question is whether they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user did make an effort to include the guest by asking if he was okay, talking to him, and introducing him to a friend. That shows they weren't just ignoring him. The guest, however, refused to engage in activities or mingle after being given opportunities. The user felt that since the guest wasn't making an effort, it was reasonable to ask him to leave. \n\nNow, considering social norms, it's generally expected that guests at a party contribute to the social atmosphere, not just expect others to come to them. If someone is unwilling to put in any effort to socialize, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave, especially if it's affecting the party's vibe. However, some might argue that the user could have handled it more kindly or given more time for the guest to adjust. But since the guest repeatedly refused to engage despite being offered help, the user's actions might be seen as justified. The coworker friend's reaction might stem from a different perspective on social situations, but the user's explanation about time and effort is valid. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
