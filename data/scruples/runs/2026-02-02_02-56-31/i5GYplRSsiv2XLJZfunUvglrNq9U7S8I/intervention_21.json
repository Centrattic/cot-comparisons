I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the user had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but not as a plus one. The guest seemed to be standing around awkwardly. The user tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest was briefly social but then went back to being alone. The user tried again to get him into a game or to mingle, but he refused. The user then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker later said it was bad to tell him to leave, but the user explained their reasoning.\n\nHmm. So the user's actions were to help the guest initially, then when the guest didn't engage further, they decided to ask him to leave. The key points here are intent and whether the user overstepped.\n\nThe guest was a plus one in a way but not officially. The user might have felt responsible for the party's atmosphere. But is it reasonable to expect a guest to socialize? Some people are naturally more introverted or shy. The user tried to help, but maybe the guest just wasn't comfortable. Telling someone to leave because they're not socializing could come off as harsh, especially if the guest felt they were just being awkward.\n\nBut on the other hand, the user is the host and has the right to manage their own party. If someone is not engaging and is affecting the environment, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave. However, the approach might be the issue here. The user's tone and the way they handled it could have been more considerate. Maybe providing a polite exit instead of a direct order. Also, the coworker's reaction suggests that the action might be seen as harsh, but the user had their reasoning.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user might not be in the wrong because they're the host and have the right to ask someone to leave if they're disrupting or not respecting the social setting. However, the method of doing so could be questioned, but the outcome was the guest left on their own. So maybe the answer is B, No, they're not in the wrong.\n"
