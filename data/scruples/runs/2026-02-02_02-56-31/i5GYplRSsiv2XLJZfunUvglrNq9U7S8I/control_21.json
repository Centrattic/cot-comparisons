I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. So the setup is that the guest was a plus one, came separately. The host tried talking to him, introduced him to someone, but then he was alone again. The host tried suggesting activities, but the guy refused. Then the host told him to leave. The coworker friend of the host thought it was shitty, but the host felt the guy wasn't making an effort.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the host's responsibility and the guest's behavior. The host did make an effort to include the guest initially, which is good. But when the guest kept being isolated, maybe the host felt overwhelmed. However, the host is the one hosting the party, and sometimes guests might find it hard to socialize, especially if they're shy or not used to big groups. \n\nBut the guest was a plus one, so maybe the host didn't really intend for him to be there if he wasn't going to participate. On the other hand, telling someone to leave because they're not socializing could be harsh. The host is the one in control of the environment, so they have some responsibility to ensure guests feel included. However, if someone is actively making it hard by not engaging, there's a point where the host can't be held responsible for the guest's discomfort. \n\nWait, the host tried twice to help the guest connect. The guest refused the suggestions. The host might have felt that their time was being taken up trying to include someone who wasn't trying. The coworker friend thought it was shitty, but the host explained their reasoning. It's a balance between being a good host and not being overly accommodating. \n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong because they made efforts, but then had to set a boundary when the guest wasn't making an effort. It's not the host's responsibility to force someone to socialize. So the answer would be B.\n"
