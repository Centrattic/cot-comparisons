I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about kicking a guest out of a party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but was a plus one. The host noticed the guest was lonely. They tried to help by introducing him to someone, but he was alone again. The guest kept saying no one talked to him, even after being introduced. The host got annoyed, told him to leave if he wasn't socializing, and the guest left. The coworker friend thought it was bad to kick him out, but the host felt he wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is wrong. The key points here are responsibility of a host, the guest's behavior, and social expectations. As a host, it's reasonable to expect guests to make some effort to socialize, especially if they're in a group. However, if someone is genuinely shy or struggling to connect, the host might need to be more patient. The guest in question didn't engage when given chances\u2014refused to join a game, didn't approach others. The host tried to help twice. The host also didn't immediately kick him out but gave multiple opportunities. \n\nOn the other hand, the act of kicking someone out could be seen as harsh. Parties are generally for socializing, but guests have the right to attend even if they don't socialize. The host's reasoning was that they couldn't take responsibility for the guest's social needs. But is it right to enforce social engagement? Some people might find parties stressful, and expecting everyone to actively socialize could be unrealistic. \n\nThe host might argue they were protecting their own energy and the vibe of the party. The coworker friend thought it was shitty, which is a subjective opinion. However, the host had the right to manage their own event. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the host made an effort to assist the guest, provided introductions, and gave choices. When the guest didn't engage, the host asked him to leave. While it's a judgment call, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong, especially since they tried to help. The answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
