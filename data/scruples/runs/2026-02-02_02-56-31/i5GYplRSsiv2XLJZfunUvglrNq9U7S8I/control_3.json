I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about hosting a party and kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus one but came separately. The author tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. But the guest kept standing around and said no one was talking to him even after being introduced. The author got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations at a party. As a guest, especially when you're invited, it's usually expected to make an effort to socialize. If someone is just standing around and not engaging, maybe they're just shy or not comfortable, but if they keep saying they're not being approached despite opportunities, that might be different. The author tried to help, but the guest didn't take initiative. \n\nBut then, as the host, the author is responsible for the environment. Maybe they have the right to ask someone to leave if they're disruptive or not following the social norms of the party. However, the guest wasn't disruptive, just not socializing. Was the author being too harsh? Maybe they should have given more time or found another way. But the guest didn't make any effort after the suggestions. \n\nAlso, the coworker friend (the one who invited the plus one) is upset. That might mean the author should have considered the feelings of the person they were close with. But the author's main issue is that they felt the guest wasn't trying. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, guests are expected to participate. On the other, the host might be too quick to judge. The author did make an effort to help, but if the guest was genuinely trying to connect but failed, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the guest's own actions (refusing to join the game, not approaching others) suggest they weren't making an effort. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they tried to help and the guest didn't reciprocate. The answer would be B, No.\n"
