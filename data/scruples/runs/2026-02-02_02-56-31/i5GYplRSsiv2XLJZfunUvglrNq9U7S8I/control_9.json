I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, the setup: a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but wasn't really. The host noticed him standing alone and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to people. The guest kept being aloof, refusing to join activities. The host got annoyed and asked him to leave, leading to the coworker friend being upset about it.\n\nSo, the host's actions: They tried to help the guest integrate, but when the guest didn't engage, the host told him to leave. The coworker thought it was harsh, but the host defended it by saying the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, considering the host's perspective: Hosting a party often involves managing the environment. If someone's presence is affecting the atmosphere negatively or if they're not contributing to the social interaction despite efforts, it's reasonable to ask them to leave. The host did make an effort to include the guest, and when that failed, it's understandable to prioritize the comfort of other guests.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have felt uncomfortable, but social responsibility isn't entirely on the host. Everyone has a role in social interactions. The guest's refusal to engage could be seen as a personal choice. However, the host has the right to maintain their event's dynamics.\n\nThe coworker's reaction might stem from feeling defensive about their friend. But the host isn't obligated to cater to every guest's needs beyond a certain point. It's a balance between being hospitable and setting boundaries.\n\nSo, the host's actions seem justified. The guest wasn't making an effort, and the host did their part. The decision to ask someone to leave when they're not contributing is a host's prerogative. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
