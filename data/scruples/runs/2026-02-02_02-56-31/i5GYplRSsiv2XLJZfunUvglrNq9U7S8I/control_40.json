I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. The host noticed the guest was awkward, tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest became isolated again, refused to join activities, and the host told him to leave.\n\nThe key points here are the host's actions. They tried to help the guest by talking and introducing him. When the guest didn't make an effort, the host decided to ask him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the host explained the situation. \n\nNow, considering social norms, it's common for some guests to be shy or not socialize much. But the host has the right to manage their party. If someone is not contributing to the social environment and is making excuses, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave, especially if it's affecting the party's vibe. \n\nBut wait, was the host too quick to judge? The guest might have had valid reasons for not socializing\u2014maybe anxiety or discomfort. The host tried to help, but after a couple of attempts, maybe giving more time would have been better. However, the guest refused all suggestions. The host's responsibility is to the other guests and their own comfort. If the guest was disruptive, even passively, the host's decision could be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the host should be more forgiving, as not everyone is naturally social. But the host isn't obligated to force interactions. The line is between being hospitable and being a pushover. The host isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially after making reasonable efforts to include the guest.\n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong). The host tried to help, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the host had the right to ask them to leave if it was affecting the party. The coworker's disapproval is subjective, but the host's actions were within their rights.\n"
