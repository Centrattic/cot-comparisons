  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For kicking a guest out of my party for not socializing?\nThis past Friday, I had a party at my house. I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user had a party and kicked out a guest who wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus one but came separately. The user tried to help him by introducing him to someone and suggesting games, but the guest kept being alone. The user got annoyed and told him to leave. Now they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user tried to be helpful initially. They checked in on the guest, introduced him, and suggested activities. But when the guest didn't engage, the user got frustrated. The key points are: did the user have a right to ask him to leave, and was it reasonable?\n\nParties are social events, so guests are expected to participate to some extent. However, forcing someone to socialize isn't fair. The user might have felt responsible for the atmosphere. But the guest might have been shy or uncomfortable. However, the guest didn't make an effort after being given opportunities. The user's actions could be seen as within their rights since they're the host, but maybe there's a better way to handle it. However, the user didn't act out of malice but frustration. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
