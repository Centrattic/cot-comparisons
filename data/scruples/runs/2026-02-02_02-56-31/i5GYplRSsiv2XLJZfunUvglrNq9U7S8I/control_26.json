I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one (though not officially), came separately. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. But after a few minutes, the guest was alone again. The host tried to engage him further but the guest refused to participate in games or mingle. The host became annoyed and told the guest to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Intent of the Host:** The party was meant for socializing, games, and food. The host made an effort to include the guest initially. The guest's behavior was passive; he didn't take initiative to interact beyond the initial help. \n\n2. **Guest's Actions:** The guest claimed no one was talking to him, but the host had already introduced him to someone. The guest didn't approach others again or make an effort. The host tried suggesting activities, which the guest refused. This could imply the guest was being difficult or expecting others to make all the effort.\n\n3. **Host's Response:** The host's decision to ask the guest to leave came after multiple attempts to integrate him. The host felt it was necessary because they couldn't spend all their time facilitating the guest's social engagement, especially since the guest wasn't making an effort. The host also informed the coworker, explaining the situation.\n\n4. **Social Norms and Expectations:** At a party, guests are usually expected to participate to some extent. However, not everyone is outgoing, and some may feel anxious. But if someone is intentionally not engaging despite efforts to help, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave, especially if it's affecting the host's experience.\n\n5. **Coworker's Reaction:** The coworker thought it was \"shitty\" to tell the guest to leave. This shows that the host's action might be seen as harsh by others, but the host explained the reasoning, which the coworker might not have fully understood initially.\n\nPotential angles to consider: Was the guest's behavior within reasonable expectations? Did the host overstep by asking someone to leave for not socializing enough? On the other hand, the host has the right to manage their own party and set boundaries. If the guest was making the host uncomfortable or disrupting the event, removal could be justified.\n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, hosts often have the right to ask guests to leave if they're causing issues. However, the line is thin. If the guest was genuinely struggling and made some effort, the host might be seen as harsh. But here, the guest refused to participate in suggested activities and showed no initiative. The host's actions might be considered reasonable in maintaining the party's atmosphere.\n\nSo, the host tried to help, the guest didn't respond positively. The host's decision might be seen as a last resort when efforts failed. Therefore, the host might not be in the wrong (Answer B). However, if the guest had a valid reason (like social anxiety) and the host could have been more understanding, then maybe A. But the question is whether the host is in the wrong based on the info given. Since the guest didn't make efforts and the host made attempts, B (not in the wrong) seems more likely.\n"
