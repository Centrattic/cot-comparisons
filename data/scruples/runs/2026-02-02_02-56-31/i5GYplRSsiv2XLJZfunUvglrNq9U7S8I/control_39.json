I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. One guest came as a plus one but not officially. The guest was standing around awkwardly. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities like a game. But the guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after the host's attempts. The host got annoyed, felt the guest was expecting others to make an effort for him, and eventually told him to leave if he wasn't going to participate.\n\nNow, considering the host's perspective: They were trying to be helpful, offering introductions and activities. The guest's behavior might be seen as not making an effort to integrate into the party. The host has the right to manage their own event and set boundaries. However, kicking someone out can be a strong action. Was there a better way to handle it? Maybe, but the host's responsibility isn't to force social interaction on others.\n\nFrom the guest's side, maybe he was uncomfortable, but he could have tried to approach others. However, people can have different comfort levels in social settings. Still, the host's party is their space, so they have the authority to decide who stays or leaves, especially if someone is not contributing to the positive environment and is being passive-aggressive or uncooperative.\n\nThe coworker who brought the guest is upset, but the host explained their reasoning. The key points here are the host's attempts to assist and the guest's refusal to engage despite that. The host isn't obligated to baby-sit someone who isn't participating. So, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
