I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who kicked someone out of their party is in the wrong. The scenario is that a guest was invited, but when he felt left out, the host tried to help him but got annoyed when he didn't take initiative. The host then told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. They had a party, invited people, and tried to help the guest. But when the guest kept isolating himself and not participating, the host felt it was their right to ask him to leave. \n\nThe guest's perspective is that he was being ignored. But the host noticed he was given opportunities to engage and refused. The key point here is whether the host overstepped by asking him to leave. \n\nParties can be social pressure, and some people are naturally shy. However, the guest had multiple chances to interact and chose not to. The host's actions might be justified if they were maintaining the atmosphere of the party. On the other hand, maybe the guest just needed more encouragement, and the host was too quick to act. \n\nAlso, the coworker (the friend) might have a different take, but the host explained their reasoning. The host's right to control their party is a factor here. They can set boundaries about behavior. If the guest was disruptive or not following basic social norms, the host could be within their rights. However, if the guest was just quiet, that's different. \n\nIn this case, the guest didn't engage even when given opportunities. The host's patience ran out, leading to the kickout. It's a judgment call. Some might say the host was justified in protecting the party's vibe, while others might think it harsh. \n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong because they tried to help and set a boundary when the guest wasn't making an effort. So the answer is B.\n"
