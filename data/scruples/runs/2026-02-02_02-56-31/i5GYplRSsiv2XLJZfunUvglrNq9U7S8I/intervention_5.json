I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but not officially invited, came along. The user noticed he was standing around awkwardly and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. However, after a short conversation, the guest was alone again. The user suggested joining a game or mingling, but the guest refused. The user then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort to socialize. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the user explained they couldn't spend time dragging him into conversations.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one, so maybe they didn't expect to be in the spotlight. The user made an effort to include him, but when that didn't work, they decided to ask him to leave. The key points here are the user's attempts to help and the guest's lack of effort to engage. The user felt that since the guest wasn't trying, it was better for him to leave. The coworker's reaction is a point against the user, but the user stands by their decision.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, parties are social events where guests are expected to mingle. If someone is there but not engaging, it's understandable that the host might feel they can't facilitate every interaction. The user tried helping, but when the guest refused to participate, telling them to leave could be seen as reasonable. However, some might argue that being a guest allows for different levels of social comfort, and the host shouldn't kick someone out for being quiet. But in this case, the guest was given multiple chances and opportunities to engage and refused. The user's main responsibility is to their other guests and the overall atmosphere. If someone is not contributing and is making themselves uncomfortable, perhaps the host isn't at fault. So, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
