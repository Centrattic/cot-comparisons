I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author was in the wrong for kicking someone out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me think about the details.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but not officially confirmed. The author tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but he ended up alone again. The guest claimed no one was talking to him even after being introduced. The author tried suggestions like joining a game or mingling, but he refused. The author then told him to leave. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the guest had a right to be there and the author's responsibility as the host. The guest wasn't making an effort to socialize. The author did make attempts to include him, but he was passive. The host has the right to manage their event and set boundaries. If someone is disruptive or not respecting the social environment, the host can ask them to leave. But was the guest actually being disruptive? He was just standing there and not engaging, but not causing trouble. However, the host might have a right to expect guests to contribute to the social atmosphere, especially if they're not making an effort. \n\nThe guest's friend (the coworker) was upset, but the host explained their reasoning. The line between being a good host and managing boundaries is a bit blurry here. The host isn't obligated to constantly intervene, and if the guest is unwilling to participate despite offers, it's reasonable to ask them to leave. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
