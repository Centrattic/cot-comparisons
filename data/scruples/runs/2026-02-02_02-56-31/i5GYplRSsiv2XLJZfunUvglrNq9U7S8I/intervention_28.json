I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user had a party and kicked out a guest who wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus one, not directly invited, but came with a coworker. The user tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone else, and suggesting activities, but the guest kept being isolated and refused to engage. The user then told him to leave, leading to the coworker defending the guest.\n\nFirst, the user's actions: they made efforts to include the guest. They asked if he was okay, talked with him, introduced him to someone with similar interests, and even suggested joining a game. The guest's response was to remain unresponsive and not take initiative. So the user felt responsible for his discomfort, but maybe they also had the right to set boundaries for their own event.\n\nThe guest's behavior seems passive-aggressive. Even after being introduced and given options, he didn't try to integrate. Maybe he's shy, but the user can't be held responsible for every guest's social skills. However, the user's decision to kick him out might come off as abrupt. But considering the guest wasn't making an effort, the user might feel justified. The coworker's reaction is a point against the user, but the user's reasoning about not having time to drag him around is valid. So, is the user at fault? It's a mix of both. The user tried, but maybe the response was harsh. But given the context, maybe not. The answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
