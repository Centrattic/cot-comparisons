I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they had a party and had a guest who was a plus one but not really. The guest kept standing around looking awkward, even after being introduced to people. The host tried helping by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest didn't engage further. Eventually, the host told the guest to leave because he wasn't making an effort to socialize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. Hosting a party requires effort, and ensuring everyone has a good time is part of that. The host tried to help the guest by engaging him and introducing him to others. However, after multiple attempts, the guest didn't participate, which might be frustrating. The host might feel responsible for the party's atmosphere and not wanting to baby someone who isn't trying to integrate.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might be introverted or anxious, making it hard for them to approach others. Even if the guest was given a chance to join a game, they refused. The host's action of kicking them out could be seen as harsh if the guest was genuinely struggling. But the host might argue that they can't be responsible for the guest's lack of initiative.\n\nThe key points here are whether the host was reasonable in their actions. Did they give the guest enough opportunities to socialize? Yes, they talked to him, introduced him, and suggested activities. The guest's refusal to engage further is on them. The host's frustration is understandable, as they can't manage every guest's social needs. However, telling someone to leave might come off as abrupt. But since the host is in their own home, they have the right to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing to the party's vibe.\n\nThe coworker friend's reaction is also a factor. She thought it was \"shitty,\" but the host explained their reasoning. Maybe the host's approach was a bit direct, but given the circumstances, it's not necessarily wrong. The host isn't obligated to force interaction. So, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the host made efforts to help and the guest didn't reciprocate.\n"
