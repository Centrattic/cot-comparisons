I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person hosting the party, the author, had a guest who was a plus one but not officially invited. The guest kept standing alone and claimed no one was talking to him. The author tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest ended up alone again. The author then suggested joining a game or mingling, which the guest refused. The author got annoyed, thinking the guest just wanted pity, and told him to leave. Now, the author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. Hosting a party requires effort, and the host is responsible for the environment. If a guest is not making an effort to socialize and is disruptive in some way, the host has the right to ask them to leave. However, in this case, the guest wasn't disruptive; he was just not engaging. The author tried twice to help integrate the guest, so maybe the issue is that the guest didn't take initiative. \n\nOn the other hand, the guest was a plus one, so maybe not everyone knew him. The author tried to help, but after two attempts, maybe the expectation was that the guest should at least try to interact. However, forcing someone to socialize isn't fair. The guest might be introverted or anxious. The key here is whether the guest was being uncooperative or if the author was being too strict. \n\nThe author's annoyance led to telling the guest to leave. Was that too harsh? The host isn't obligated to personally socialize every guest, especially if the guest isn't making an effort. But the author did try to help. However, the guest's refusal to engage could be seen as a social issue on his part, not the author's. \n\nI think the author's actions were reasonable. They made an effort to include the guest, but when the guest refused to participate, it was acceptable to ask him to leave. The host isn't responsible for making every guest feel comfortable if the guest isn't willing to put in any effort. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
