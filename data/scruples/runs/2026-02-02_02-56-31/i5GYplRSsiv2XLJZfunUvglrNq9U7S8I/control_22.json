I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about them kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The guest was a plus one but came separately. The author tried to introduce him to someone, but he kept standing alone. The author got annoyed because the guest didn't make an effort to mingle and told him to leave. The coworker friend thought it was harsh, but the author explained their reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. Hosting a party usually involves creating a welcoming environment. The guest was there with a friend, so maybe he didn't feel comfortable. The author did try to help by introducing him, but he didn't follow up. The guest's behavior might be due to being shy or having social anxiety. The author got frustrated and told him to leave, which the coworker found harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the host has the right to manage their party. If someone is not engaging and is causing discomfort, maybe it's reasonable to ask them to leave. But is that the host's responsibility? The guest wasn't being disruptive, just passive. The author might have overreacted. Should the guest be expected to make an effort to socialize, or is it the host's job to ensure everyone is included?\n\nAlso, the guest was a plus one, not officially invited. The coworker might not have known he'd be there. The author might have felt the guest was an uninvited plus one. Was that a factor? The author might have felt obligated to accommodate him, but if the guest didn't try to integrate, maybe the host's patience was tested.\n\nIn some cases, people might feel awkward at parties, and it's the host's role to help them. However, the host can't be responsible for every guest's social skills. There's a balance. The author tried twice to help the guest, and when it didn't work, decided to ask him to leave. Is that fair? Or is it unkind to exclude someone who's just not social?\n\nI think it depends on the context. The author did make an effort. If the guest continued to be unengaged, maybe it's okay. But the host's approach might have been too abrupt. Alternative actions could include giving the guest more time or suggesting a quieter activity. However, the host has the right to enforce party etiquette. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
