I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for kicking out the guest. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user hosted a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one of a coworker but came separately, was acting awkward. The user tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then became isolated again, refused to join activities, and the user got annoyed. The user told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize, and the coworker later criticized the user for being harsh.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about social responsibility and the host's expectations. The guest claimed he wasn't being talked to, but the host tried to help. The guest didn't make an effort to integrate himself into the party beyond the initial help. The user might feel responsible for ensuring the guest feels included, but they also have their own limits on how much they can assist someone who isn't cooperative.\n\nThe user's argument is that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize, just wanted others to accommodate him. The coworker, who is the guest's friend, might feel the user was too quick to act. But the user had already tried to help twice. The guest's refusal to engage in games or mingle could be seen as not taking responsibility for their own social interaction.\n\nIn social situations, it's often expected that guests make some effort to interact. The host isn't obligated to constantly intervene if the guest doesn't reciprocate. However, telling someone to leave might come off as harsh, even if justified. The user might have handled it differently, like giving the guest space or not inviting them in the first place if they knew the person was a plus one but separate. But since the coworker invited him, maybe the user had to manage that.\n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because they made a genuine effort to help, and the guest didn't take initiative. The user's right to set boundaries at their own party is valid. The coworker's criticism might stem from defending their friend. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
