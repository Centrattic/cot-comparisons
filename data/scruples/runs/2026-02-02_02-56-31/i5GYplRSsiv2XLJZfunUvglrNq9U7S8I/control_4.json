I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a party where the host kicks out a guest for not socializing. The guest came with a coworker, and the host noticed he was being awkward. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after the host suggested joining a game and mingling, which he refused. Then the host told him to leave, and the coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the host was justified in doing that. The host had a responsibility to manage the party, and if someone is not participating and seems to be causing discomfort without trying to engage, maybe it's reasonable. But on the other hand, the guest was there with a plus one, and the host might have a duty to ensure all guests feel included. However, the guest didn't make any effort beyond what the host suggested. The host tried helping, and when the guest refused, maybe it's not their fault. The key points are that the host made an effort to include the guest, the guest refused to engage, and the host then asked him to leave to maintain the party's environment. It seems like the host isn't in the wrong here because they tried to accommodate and the guest wasn't cooperative. So the answer should be B.\n"
