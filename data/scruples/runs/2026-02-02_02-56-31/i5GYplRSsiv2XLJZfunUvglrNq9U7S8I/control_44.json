I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I The Asshole) story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The situation involves the guest being a plus one but not really, coming alone, and then not socializing despite being approached and offered help.\n\nFirst, the host tried to help the guest by talking to him and introducing him to others. The guest then kept being isolated, even after suggestions to join activities. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the host stood by their decision because they felt the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations at a party, guests are generally expected to engage to some degree. If someone is clearly not making an effort and is just waiting for others to initiate, that can be frustrating for the host. The host did make attempts to include the guest, but maybe there's a line where the host isn't responsible for forcing socialization. However, the host's own party means they have the right to set boundaries.\n\nPossible angles: Was the guest's behavior reasonable? Did the host give enough chances? Is it the host's responsibility to ensure every guest is included? The coworker's friend might have thought it was harsh, but the host's perspective is that the guest wasn't taking initiative. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is usually about accountability. The host did try to help, but the guest's refusal to engage might have crossed a line. However, telling someone to leave could be seen as abrupt. But given the host's own time and effort, perhaps they're justified. So the answer might lean towards B (host not in the wrong).\n"
