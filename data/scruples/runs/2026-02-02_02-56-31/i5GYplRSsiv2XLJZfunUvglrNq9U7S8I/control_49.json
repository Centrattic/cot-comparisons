I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The host had a party, and a guest was being left out. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to a friend. But when the guest was left alone again, he complained about not being talked to. The host then suggested joining a game and mingling, but the guest refused. The host got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guest didn't make an effort to socialize, the host tried to help, but the guest kept isolating himself. The host's frustration led to asking him to leave.\n\nNow, considering the host's perspective, they were trying to be accommodating. They even took time to talk to the guest and make introductions. However, when the guest didn't take initiative after being given opportunities, the host felt it was necessary to remove him to maintain the party's atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest's plus one coworker thought it was \"shitty\" for the host to kick him out. The guest might feel he was treated unfairly, but he did have the chance to engage but chose not to. \n\nThe host's responsibility is to ensure the party is enjoyable for everyone. If a guest is not contributing to the social environment and is being a burden, the host has the right to ask them to leave. The guest's inaction here might have justified the host's decision.\n\nTherefore, the host isn't in the wrong because the guest didn't put in the effort. The answer should be B.\n"
