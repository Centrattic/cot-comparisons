I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing at their party. The guest was a plus-one but came separately. The host tried talking to him, introduced him to someone, but the guest kept being alone. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The user is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social etiquette here. Hosting a party comes with responsibilities, but guests also have some responsibility to engage. The guest in question didn't make an effort beyond what the host initiated. The host tried multiple times to help him integrate, but he didn't reciprocate. \n\nThe user argues that the guest wanted others to make an effort for him, which isn't fair. However, some might say the host should have been more patient. But since the guest wasn't contributing to socializing, maybe the host was justified. The coworker friend was upset, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nIn such cases, it's a balance between being a good host and having boundaries. If the guest was actively disruptive, it's one thing, but here it's more about not participating. However, since the guest was left alone and the host had other guests, maybe it's understandable. So, I think the host isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
