I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but not formally invited, was standing around awkwardly. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after the host made efforts. Eventually, the host told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort to socialize.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the host give the guest enough opportunities to engage? The host did ask if he was okay, talked to him, introduced him to someone else, and suggested joining a game. The guest refused both times. The host then decided he was being uncooperative and asked him to leave.\n\nIs it reasonable for the host to expect guests to make some effort? If a guest is at a social event and completely refuses to engage despite being offered help, maybe the host isn't obligated to keep facilitating. The host might feel it's unfair to others or that the guest is not respecting the event's purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest had social anxiety or was just shy. The host's approach could be seen as harsh, especially since the guest was a plus one. But the host also has the right to manage their event and ensure it's a positive environment for everyone else. \n\nThe coworker who was the guest's friend thought it was shitty, but the host explained that the guest wasn't making an effort. The host isn't responsible for dragging the guest around to make him talk. So, in this case, the host tried to help and gave chances. If the guest still isn't engaging, maybe the host isn't in the wrong for asking him to leave. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the host made reasonable efforts and the guest didn't reciprocate. The host has the right to enforce some social expectations at their own party.\n"
