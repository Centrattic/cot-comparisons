I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest who was a plus one of a coworker came alone. He seemed awkward and stood around not socializing. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with common interests. The guest then kept being alone again, refused to join activities or mingle. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. Now they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, first, the host tried multiple times to help the guest. They talked to him, introduced him, suggested games and mingling, but he didn't engage. The guest claimed no one was talking to him despite earlier interactions. The host's main point was that the guest wasn't making an effort, and the host had limited time and couldn't be responsible for dragging him into conversations.\n\nI need to consider social norms. It's common for guests to be responsible for their own socializing. Hosts can't be expected to force interactions. However, the guest was a plus one, maybe not the main invitee. The host's party is their space, and if someone is not contributing to the social environment, it's reasonable to ask them to leave. The host did give several opportunities for the guest to integrate but when the guest refused, the host had the right to set boundaries. The coworker friend thought it was harsh, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest had valid reasons for being shy or not fitting in, but the host isn't obligated to manage every guest's social comfort. The key is whether the host acted unreasonably. Since the guest didn't make an effort and the host tried to help, it seems justified. So, the answer would be B, the host isn't in the wrong.\n"
