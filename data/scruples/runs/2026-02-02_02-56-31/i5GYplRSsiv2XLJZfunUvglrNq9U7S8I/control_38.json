I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post did something wrong by kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one, but not officially. He was a friend of a coworker who came separately. The author noticed he was awkward, tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then became isolated again, refused to join a game or mingle, and the author told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset, but the author felt the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guest was there as a plus one but not invited himself. The author made two attempts to help him socialize. The guest didn't respond well, and the author decided he wasn't making an effort. Then, the author asked him to leave. \n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette. Hosting a party comes with responsibilities, like ensuring guests are comfortable. However, the author tried to assist the guest. The guest might have felt shy or out of place, but refusing to engage further could be seen as not making effort. The author felt overwhelmed and couldn't spend more time helping. Is it wrong to ask someone to leave if they're not participating and the host is managing the event?\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. For example, giving the guest more time or finding another way to help him integrate. However, the author did make efforts. Also, the guest's behavior might have been passive-aggressive, expecting others to approach him instead of reaching out. \n\nThe coworker friend thought it was \"shitty,\" but the author explained the situation. The decision to ask someone to leave can be hard, but if the guest isn't contributing and the host can't manage it, maybe it's justified. However, the guest might have had valid reasons for being awkward. But the author tried twice. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the host isn't obligated to force socialization, but creating an inclusive environment is expected. The guest might have overstepped by expecting the host to do all the work. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to maintain the party's atmosphere. \n\nOn the flip side, public shaming or abrupt ejection could be harsh. But the author approached the guest privately and gave him options. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they made good faith efforts and the guest wasn't cooperating. Alternatively, maybe the author should have been more patient. \n\nI think the balance here is that the author isn't wrong because they tried to help, and the guest wasn't making an effort. The host has the right to manage their event. So the answer is B (No).\n"
