I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. They described the situation where the guest was a plus one, came separately, and kept standing alone despite being approached once. The user tried to help by introducing him to someone, but he didn't engage further. Then the user got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the guest's perspective. If he was uncomfortable or not good at socializing, maybe he felt anxious. But the user did try to help. However, the guest didn't make an effort to interact beyond the initial conversation. The user might have felt their time was being consumed trying to accommodate someone who wasn't contributing to the social environment.\n\nOn the other hand, hosting a party is about creating a welcoming space. If someone isn't engaging, it could be a personal issue, but the host isn't obligated to force interaction. The user asked if they were in the wrong. The key here is whether the guest was being respectful of the host's time and the event's purpose. If the guest was actively making the user uncomfortable by not participating, the user's decision might be justifiable. However, kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh, especially if the guest was genuinely trying but struggling.\n\nBut the user did make efforts to include him, and the guest refused further attempts. The user was managing the party and had other guests to attend to. In that case, the user might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries. The coworker friend's reaction might indicate that not everyone agrees, but the host has the right to control their own event. So, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
