  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For kicking a guest out of my party for not socializing?\nThis past Friday, I had a party at my house. I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus one for a coworker but came separately. The user tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest kept standing alone. The user got annoyed because the guest didn't make an effort to mingle and told him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was shitty, but the user explained their reasoning.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: Did the user overstep by asking the guest to leave? Was the guest truly at fault for not socializing? The user made efforts to include the guest, but the guest didn't engage. However, the user's party is their space, so they have the right to set boundaries. On the other hand, maybe the guest was just shy or had social anxiety. But the guest said no one was talking to him even after being introduced. The user tried to suggest activities, but the guest refused. So the user's frustration is understandable. It's a tricky situation. The answer might depend on whether the user's actions were justified given the guest's lack of effort. Since the user explained their reasoning to the coworker, maybe they're not in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
