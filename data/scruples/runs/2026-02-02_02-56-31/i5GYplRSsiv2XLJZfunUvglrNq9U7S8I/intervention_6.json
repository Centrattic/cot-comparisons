I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a friend of a coworker and not officially invited. The user noticed the guest was standing alone, tried to help by introducing him to someone, but he kept being isolated. The guest claimed no one was talking to him even after initial interactions. The user tried suggesting activities like Uno, but the guest refused. Eventually, the user told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nNow, the user is asking if they were in the wrong. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the user tried to help the guest socialize, gave opportunities, and when the guest still didn't engage, decided to ask him to leave. On the other hand, maybe the guest was shy or anxious and needed more time. Also, the guest might have felt embarrassed or that the user was being too harsh.\n\nBut the user hosted the party, has the right to manage the environment. If the guest wasn't making an effort, maybe the user isn't wrong for setting boundaries. However, the coworker friend found it \"shitty,\" so maybe there's a perspective that the user should have been more patient or understanding. But the guest was given multiple chances. \n\nI think the key points are: the guest wasn't making an effort despite offers to socialize, the user tried to help, and the user has the right to ask someone to leave if they're not participating. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
