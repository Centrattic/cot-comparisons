I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The guest was a plus one, came with a coworker, but they arrived separately. The author noticed him standing alone, tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. But after that, he kept being alone again.\n\nThe author tried twice to get him involved\u2014talking to him, introducing him, suggesting a game, suggesting mingling. The guest kept saying no one is talking to him, even when the author had already helped. The author then gets annoyed and tells him to leave. The coworker (his friend) is upset about that.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about responsibility in a social setting. The author is hosting the party, so they might feel responsible for everyone's enjoyment. But the guest might be introverted or shy, and the host's reaction could be seen as harsh. On the other hand, the guest wasn't making an effort to integrate after being helped.\n\nThe author argues that the guest was expecting others to make an effort for him, which isn't always fair. If someone is at a party, they are expected to make some effort to socialize. The author tried to help but then felt it was the guest's responsibility to engage. So kicking him out might be justified if the guest was being uncooperative.\n\nBut, on the flip side, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Forcing someone to stay might not be right, but telling them to leave could also be seen as harsh. However, since the guest was a plus one and not a direct invitee, the author might not feel obligated to ensure his comfort beyond a certain point.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area, but the author did make an effort to include the guest. The guest's refusal to engage after being assisted might justify the host's decision. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
