I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they kicked a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but not officially. The coworker brought them along. The author noticed the guest was standing around awkwardly. They tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities like Uno. The guest kept being alone again and refused to engage further. The author got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was mean to send him home.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they hosted a party, tried to help the guest integrate, but when the guest didn't take initiative, the author felt it was necessary to ask him to leave. The guest might have been socially awkward or perhaps just not interested in the party vibe. But the author had a responsibility to manage the event and ensure it was comfortable for all attendees.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest was there as a guest, maybe not expecting to have to socialize. Maybe he was just shy or not in the mood. The author's actions could be seen as abrupt, especially since they gave the guest multiple chances. However, the author also had the right to set boundaries for their own party. If the guest was making the author uncomfortable by not engaging, it's reasonable to ask them to leave if they're not contributing to the social environment.\n\nThe key factors here are whether the author handled it appropriately. They tried to help, but when the guest didn't respond, they took action. The coworker (his friend) is upset, but the author explained their reasoning. It's a judgment call, but since the author made an effort to include the guest first, and the guest refused to participate, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
