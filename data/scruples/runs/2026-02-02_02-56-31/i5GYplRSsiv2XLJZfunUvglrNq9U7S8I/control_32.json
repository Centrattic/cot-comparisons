I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

Hmm.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but not officially invited. The host noticed him being awkward, tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests and suggesting activities. But the guest kept standing alone and refused to engage. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker (the friend) thought it was shitty, but the host explained they couldn't be responsible for the guest's efforts.\n\nSo, the host tried to integrate him but he wasn't making an effort. The guest was being passive. The host's party is their space, right? If someone isn't trying to socialize despite being offered help, maybe the host isn't in the wrong. Also, the coworker was the one who brought him, but they came separately. The host isn't responsible for the guest's behavior. The key points are the host's attempts to include and the guest's refusal to engage. The host can set boundaries. So probably answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
