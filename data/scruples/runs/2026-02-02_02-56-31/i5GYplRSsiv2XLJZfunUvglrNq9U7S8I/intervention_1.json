I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest who was a \"plus one\" but came separately started feeling left out. The user tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest ended up being alone again. The user then got annoyed and told the guest to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker (the guest's friend) was upset about it.\n\nFirst, the user did make an effort to help the guest by talking to him and introducing him. But when the guest didn't engage further, the user felt it was their responsibility to manage the party. The key points here are the user's intent and the actions taken. The user isn't obligated to force socialization or take responsibility for the guest's discomfort. However, the way they handled it might come off as harsh. Kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as rude, even if the guest was withdrawn. The user could have handled it with more tact, maybe by offering to help again or setting a kinder boundary. The coworker's reaction suggests that the user's approach might have been too direct. So, while the user isn't entirely in the wrong, the method used could be questioned. But considering the context, maybe the answer leans towards not in the wrong (B).\n"
