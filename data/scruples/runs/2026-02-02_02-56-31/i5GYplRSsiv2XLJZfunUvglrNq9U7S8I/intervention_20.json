I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who kicked the guest out is in the wrong. The situation is a party where a guest, a plus one of a coworker, was being awkward. The host tried talking to him, introduced him to someone else, but the guest kept isolating himself, refused to join activities. The host then told him to leave.\n\nFirst, the host did make some efforts to include the guest. They talked to him, introduced him to another friend. But after the guest was left alone again and refused to engage further, the host decided he could leave. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was bad, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nI need to consider social norms. Hosting a party means you have a responsibility to make guests feel comfortable, but also, guests should make an effort to socialize. If someone is completely unengaged and refuses all attempts to help, the host might not be at fault for setting boundaries. However, the host is the one who decided to kick the guest out, which could be seen as harsh, especially since it was a plus one and the guest might have been there for a reason. \n\nOn the other hand, the host has the right to manage their party and set expectations. If the guest didn't want to socialize and was making the host uncomfortable, then maybe it's understandable. But kicking someone out for not socializing isn't common. Usually, you'd ask them to try to engage more or just let them be if they're okay. \n\nThe key points: The guest claimed no one was talking to him, but the host tried twice to help. The guest refused to participate. Host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker thought it was shitty, but host had their reasons. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The host did try to help, but the act of kicking someone out might be seen as harsh. However, the host is also responsible for the atmosphere of the party. If the guest was disruptive or uncooperative, they have the right to ask them to leave. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the host made efforts and had the right to set boundaries. But some might argue that the guest had a right to be there and the host was too quick to act. It depends on cultural norms and how the situation was handled. The host did ask the coworker later, so they tried to be fair. I think the host is not in the wrong.\n"
