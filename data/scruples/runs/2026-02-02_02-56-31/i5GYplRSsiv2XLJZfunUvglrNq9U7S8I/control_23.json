I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the host was in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus one, came separately, and kept standing around alone. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. But the guest kept saying no one was talking to him and refused to engage. The host got annoyed and asked him to leave.\n\nFirst, the host had a responsibility to manage the party and ensure comfort for all. The guest wasn't making an effort to socialize despite being offered help. The host tried multiple times to integrate him but he remained passive. The host didn't act out of malice but out of frustration with the guest's lack of initiative. The coworker friend was upset, but the host explained the situation. \n\nThe key here is whether the host overstepped. The guest wasn't disruptive, just awkward and unresponsive. However, the host is in their right to set boundaries. If the guest's presence was causing discomfort or disrupting the event, removing him isn't unreasonable. The host's actions were based on the guest's refusal to participate and the host's need to manage the party. It's a judgment call, but the host's perspective is valid. So the answer is B, the host isn't in the wrong.\n"
