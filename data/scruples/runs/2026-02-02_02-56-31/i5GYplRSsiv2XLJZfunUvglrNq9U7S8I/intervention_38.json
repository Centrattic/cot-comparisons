I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus one, came with a coworker, but they arrived separately. The user tried to help the guest by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. The guest kept standing alone and refused to join in, leading the user to tell him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Hosting a party is about creating a comfortable environment for guests. The user did make an effort to include the guest by introducing him and suggesting activities. However, the guest didn't reciprocate by trying to socialize. The user's frustration is understandable if they felt their time and effort were being wasted.\n\nBut then, as the host, do they have the right to tell someone to leave? It depends. If the guest was causing disruption, maybe. But in this case, the issue is the guest's lack of social engagement. The user might have overreacted, but the guest also didn't make an effort. The coworker friend was upset, which adds a layer of social pressure.\n\nAnother angle: the guest might have been anxious or shy. The user's approach of suggesting interaction might not have been enough. However, the user isn't obligated to force someone to socialize. The key here is whether the user acted unreasonably. They didn't ask the guest to leave immediately after one attempt but after multiple failed efforts. The user might not be in the wrong because they tried to help and the guest didn't cooperate. Still, some might argue that the host should be more patient and not kick someone out for being quiet.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer could be B, not in the wrong. The user tried to assist, and the guest wasn't making an effort. The host has the right to manage their event as they see fit, especially if someone is not engaging and it's affecting the host's experience.\n"
