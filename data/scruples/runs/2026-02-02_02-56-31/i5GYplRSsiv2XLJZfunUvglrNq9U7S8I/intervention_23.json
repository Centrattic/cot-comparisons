I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party because they weren't socializing. The guest was a plus one, not officially invited, and came with a coworker. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. But after a couple of attempts, the guest kept standing alone and refused to join activities. The host then told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the host is responsible for the party and might not have the time or patience to manage someone who isn't engaging. The guest was a plus one, so maybe the host didn't expect them to be a regular attendee. The host tried to help, but the guest didn't make an effort, which could be frustrating. \n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to leave can be harsh, especially if they're already feeling excluded. The guest might be introverted or just shy, and the host's solution of telling them to leave might not be the best approach. Even if the guest was a plus one, it's still a social event, and the host should consider others' feelings. However, the host is also within their rights to manage their event as they see fit. The guest's behavior of not making an effort could be seen as self-isolating, which the host isn't obligated to accommodate beyond a certain point.\n\nI should also think about social norms. It's common to expect guests to at least make an effort to socialize at a party. If someone is completely unengaged and refuses offers to join in, the host might have the right to ask them to leave, especially if it's affecting the atmosphere for others. But the host's approach could be seen as abrupt. Maybe a more gentle approach would have been better, but the outcome here was direct.\n\nThe key points are: the guest was a plus one, tried to avoid socializing despite offers, and the host intervened after attempts failed. The host's responsibility is to their own party and their guests. The coworker who invited the guest might be in a position to handle it, but the host is the one hosting. So, depending on the context, the host might not be entirely in the wrong, but it's a close call. However, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong because the guest wasn't making an effort, and the host tried to help. So answer B.\n"
