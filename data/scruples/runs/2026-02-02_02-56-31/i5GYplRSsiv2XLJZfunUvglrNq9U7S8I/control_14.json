I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a party where the host kicked out a guest because he wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus one but came separately. The host tried to help him by introducing him to someone and suggesting activities, but he kept being alone. Then the host told him to leave.\n\nHmm, so the host's perspective is that the guest wasn't making an effort and was being passive. The host probably felt responsible for the party's atmosphere and that the guest wasn't contributing. But is it right to kick someone out for not socializing? If someone is shy or introverted, maybe they need more time to adjust. The host tried to help once, but maybe they didn't give enough time or support. Also, the guest might be feeling uncomfortable or anxious, which isn't their fault. \n\nBut on the other hand, a party is a social event, and guests are expected to participate to some extent. If someone is just standing around and not engaging, maybe the host is justified in setting boundaries. However, telling them to leave seems harsh. Perhaps there's a middle ground, like suggesting they leave if they aren't having fun. \n\nThe coworker friend of the guest thought it was shitty, but the host explained their reasoning. The host's responsibility as the host is to manage the event, but they should also be considerate of guests' feelings. Maybe the host overstepped by making them leave instead of finding another solution. \n\nI think the key points are: Did the guest have a valid reason for being awkward? Did the host give enough support? Was the host's reaction proportionate? Since the host tried a couple of times to help, but the guest didn't engage, maybe the host felt it was necessary to maintain the party's vibe. However, kicking someone out for not socializing might be too strict. There could be underlying issues the guest was facing. \n\nI'm leaning towards the host not being in the wrong because they made an effort to assist and set a boundary when the guest wasn't contributing. But some might argue that the host should be more accommodating. The answer probably depends on cultural norms and expectations of parties. In some contexts, the host isn't responsible for every guest's social success, so they aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
