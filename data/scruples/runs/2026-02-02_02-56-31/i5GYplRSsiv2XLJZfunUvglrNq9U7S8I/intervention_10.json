I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about hosting a party and kicking someone out because they weren't socializing. So first, the user had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker, but not as a plus one. The user noticed the guest was isolated and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. When that didn't work, the guest kept being alone and refused to join activities. The user then told him to leave.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the guest's behavior and the host's response. The guest seems to be uncomfortable and not engaging, even when given opportunities. The host tried to help by initial interaction and introduction. But when the guest still didn't participate, the host got annoyed and asked him to leave. The question is whether that was fair.\n\nOn one hand, the host is responsible for managing the party and ensuring everyone has a good time. If someone is not making an effort to socialize despite help, maybe they're disrupting the atmosphere. On the other hand, the guest might have shyness or social anxiety, and the host's reaction might have been too harsh.\n\nBut the host did make an effort to help first. The guest also refused to engage in activities when suggested. The host might feel it's unreasonable to force socialization. However, telling someone to leave can be seen as harsh, especially in a social setting. The host's coworker friend thought it was \"shitty,\" which adds another perspective. But the host explained they had limited time and couldn't help further.\n\nI think the host isn't entirely wrong here. The guest was given chances to interact and chose not to. The host has the right to manage their event. But maybe there's a middle ground, like offering more support instead of immediate ejection. However, the host did attempt to integrate the guest and then made a judgment call. So maybe answer B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
