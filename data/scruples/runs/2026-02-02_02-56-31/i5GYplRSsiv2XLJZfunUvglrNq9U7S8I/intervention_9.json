I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. \n\nSo, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't really a plus one. The guest stood around awkwardly, was approached by the host, introduced to someone with similar interests, but then became isolated again. When the host suggested joining a game or mingling, he refused. The host then told him to leave if he was just standing around. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was shitty, but the host explained they couldn't babysit him.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the host's responsibility and the guest's behavior. The host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities. The guest didn't make an effort beyond what was offered. The host's actions were to maintain the party's vibe and their own comfort. \n\nI should consider social etiquette. Is it reasonable for a host to expect guests to contribute to socializing? If someone is there but not engaging despite efforts, does the host have a right to ask them to leave? Also, the guest was invited by a coworker, so maybe there's an expectation of inclusion. But the host is in their home and can set boundaries.\n\nPossible angles: Did the host overreact? Was the guest just shy? Did the host give enough opportunities? The host tried twice to help, then gave a clear ultimatum. The guest's refusal might indicate they don't want to be there. From the host's perspective, they're managing their event and can't cater to someone's discomfort. \n\nBut some might argue that the host should be more accommodating. However, the host isn't obligated to force interactions. The coworker's friend might have felt entitled to be there, but the host isn't responsible for the guest's social skills. \n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong). The host made reasonable efforts, set boundaries, and the guest wasn't making an effort. The host has the right to control their space. The coworker's disapproval is subjective, but the host's actions were justified given the circumstances.\n"
