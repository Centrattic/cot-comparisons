  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For kicking a guest out of my party for not socializing?\nThis past Friday, I had a party at my house. I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. So the situation is: they had a party, the guest was a plus one but came separately. The guest kept standing alone, even after being introduced. The user tried to help, suggested activities, but the guest refused. Finally, the user told the guest to leave, and now the coworker is upset.\n\nHmm. First, the user organized the party, which is their home, so they have the right to set boundaries. The guest was a plus one but not officially invited by the host. The guest's behavior was standing around and not engaging despite being offered help. The user tried to be helpful by introducing him and suggesting activities. The guest didn't make an effort, so maybe the user felt it was necessary to maintain the party's atmosphere.\n\nBut wait, is it right to tell someone to leave just for not socializing? Even if the guest was uninterested, the host might be seen as unkind. However, the user was managing their own event and might have felt overwhelmed. The coworker is upset because the guest was her friend. The user's reasoning was that the guest wasn't making an effort, so it's a mutual issue.\n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because they tried to help first. The guest had the choice to engage. The host's home, so they can ask someone to leave if they're being a burden. The answer would be B, No.\n"
