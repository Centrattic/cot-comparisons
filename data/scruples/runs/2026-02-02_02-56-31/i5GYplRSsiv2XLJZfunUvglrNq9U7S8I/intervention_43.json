I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they had a party and kicked out a guest who wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed him standing alone, tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. Then when he was alone again, the host suggested joining a game and mingling, but he refused. The host got annoyed because the guest didn't make an effort and told him to leave.\n\nFirst, the host's perspective: They tried to help the guest by engaging him and introducing him to others. When that didn't work, they gave suggestions again. The guest kept being unresponsive, so the host decided to ask him to leave. The host might feel that the guest was not taking initiative to socialize, even when given opportunities, so it's not the host's fault if the guest chose to stand around.\n\nThe guest's perspective: He might feel that he was ignored by others, so even if he tried to talk, people didn't respond. Maybe he felt uncomfortable or anxious, making it hard to approach others. He might not have realized that the host expected him to make an effort beyond just being introduced once.\n\nThe coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh to kick him out. But the host explained that they couldn't spend time dragging him around. The question is whether the host overstepped by asking him to leave. \n\nSocially, parties require some level of self-initiation. If someone isn't making an effort to engage despite being offered help, it's reasonable for the host to set boundaries. However, the host could have handled it more gracefully instead of just telling him to leave. Maybe offering another chance or understanding that the guest might be shy. But since the guest refused all suggestions and didn't engage, the host might feel justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the host could argue that they were managing their own event and had the right to ask someone to leave if they were disruptive or not following the social norms of the party. But the guest wasn't disruptive; he was just not socializing. So maybe the host was too harsh. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The host tried to help, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host's actions might be seen as being within their rights as the host, but some might say they could have been more patient. However, considering the effort made and the guest's refusal to engage, the host might not be in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
