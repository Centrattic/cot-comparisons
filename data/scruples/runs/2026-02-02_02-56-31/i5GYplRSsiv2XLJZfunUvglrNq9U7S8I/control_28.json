I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. One guest was a friend of a coworker, but they came separately. The host noticed this person was standing alone, tried to help by talking to them, introducing them to someone with similar interests, suggested joining a game. The guest kept saying no one was talking to them and then refused to engage further. The host got annoyed and told them to leave, then informed the coworker.\n\nSo the key points here: the host tried to help the guest integrate, but the guest didn't take initiative. The host felt it was their right to ask them to leave because they weren't making an effort. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was harsh, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Parties are social events, and guests are expected to participate to some degree. If someone is attending, they should make an effort to engage. However, the host also has the right to set boundaries if someone is not contributing to the atmosphere and is being a burden.\n\nThe host tried to assist multiple times. The guest's behavior might be due to shyness, but the host can't be responsible for every guest's social interactions. It's reasonable for the host to expect guests to take some initiative. If the guest refuses all suggestions and remains unengaged, the host isn't obligated to keep them around. The host's action could be seen as protecting the party's vibe and their own energy.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the host could have handled it more gently or given more time. But since the guest was given opportunities and still refused, the host's decision isn't unreasonable. The host is responsible for their own event and can ask people to leave if they're not respecting the event's purpose.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They tried to help, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the host has the right to maintain their event's environment.\n"
