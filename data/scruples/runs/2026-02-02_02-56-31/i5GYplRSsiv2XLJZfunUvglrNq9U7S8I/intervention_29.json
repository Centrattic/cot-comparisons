I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user had a party and invited some friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a friend of a coworker, came along. The user noticed he was awkward and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guy then kept standing alone again, refused to join games or mingle, and even when asked, he claimed no one was talking to him.\n\nThe user got annoyed because it seemed like the guest was expecting others to make an effort without him trying. They told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the user defended their decision.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user was in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The user made initial efforts to include the guest. The guest didn't reciprocate and refused to engage. Parties are social events; expecting guests to make some effort to participate is reasonable. However, telling someone to leave might come off as abrupt. But the user was the host, so they have the right to manage their event. The guest wasn't disruptive, just disengaged. The user's action might be seen as enforcing some level of participation, which is a host's prerogative. On the other hand, maybe there's a more empathetic approach, like giving more time to adjust. But the user had tried multiple times. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the key here is that the host isn't obligated to force interactions. If the guest can't or won't engage, the host is within their rights to ask them to leave to maintain the party's vibe. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
