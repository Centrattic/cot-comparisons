I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The guest was a plus one for a coworker, came separately. The user noticed him standing around awkwardly, tried to help by introducing him to a friend with similar interests. The guest then went back to being alone, didn't engage in games or mingle. The user got annoyed because the guest kept saying no one was talking to him even after being introduced. The user told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize, and the coworker thought it was harsh.\n\nHmm. So first, the user is the host, right? They had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest was a plus one, but maybe not officially. The user tried to help, but the guest wasn't putting in effort. The user got annoyed and asked him to leave. The coworker is upset about it.\n\nI need to consider the host's responsibility. Hosts often try to make guests feel welcome, but they also have the right to ask someone to leave if they're disruptive or not engaging. The guest in question wasn't participating, kept isolating himself, and maybe was being passive-aggressive by not making an effort. The user tried to help twice. The coworker might be defending the guest, but the user's party should have their own comfort in mind. However, maybe the user was too quick to judge. Did the guest have a valid reason? Maybe he was shy or had other issues. But the user's main point is that the guest wasn't trying to socialize.\n\nIn similar situations, people often say the host isn't in the wrong if the guest isn't making an effort. Parties are social events, and guests are expected to participate to some extent. If someone is just waiting for others to approach them, that's not their fault entirely, but if they're not trying at all, the host might have a right to ask them to leave. So maybe answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
