  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For kicking a guest out of my party for not socializing?\nThis past Friday, I had a party at my house. I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by kicking a guest out of their party because that person wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one, but maybe not officially invited. The user noticed the guest was standing alone and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others. But the guest kept being isolated even after those efforts. The user got annoyed because the guest seemed to want others to make an effort for him instead of trying to socialize himself. Then the user told him to leave, which the coworker friend thought was bad, but the user explained their reasoning.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the user have the right to ask the guest to leave? Was the guest's behavior a valid reason? The user tried to help but felt the guest wasn't making an effort. In social settings, guests are expected to participate to some extent. If someone is just standing around not making an effort, the host might feel it's disruptive. But is it fair to kick someone out for that? Maybe the user was within their right as the host, but the guest might have felt embarrassed or offended. However, the user did try to help first. The coworker friend was upset, but the user explained the situation. So, maybe the user isn't in the wrong because they made sincere attempts to include the guest and then had to set a boundary. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
