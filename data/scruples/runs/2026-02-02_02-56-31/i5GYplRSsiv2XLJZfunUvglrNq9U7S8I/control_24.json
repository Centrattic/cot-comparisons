I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, the context: The host had a party and a guest (a plus one) was standing around alone multiple times. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to others, and suggesting activities. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after being introduced. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the host's actions. They did attempt to assist the guest, making introductions and offering activities. The guest wasn't making an effort to socialize beyond what the host did. The host might feel responsible for the party's atmosphere and their own stress. But guests are expected to make some effort to socialize on their own. However, telling someone to leave because they're not socializing could be seen as harsh. The guest might have social anxiety or be shy, which the host might not be accounting for. The host's responsibility is to their own event, but maybe they were a bit abrupt. On the other hand, if the guest was making others uncomfortable or not contributing, the host could be justified. But in this case, the guest was just quiet. So, is it the host's fault for not giving more time, or the guest's for not trying? The host did try multiple times. Maybe the host is within their rights to ask someone to leave if they're not participating and it's affecting the host's experience. But some might argue that the host should be more accommodating. The answer might be B, the host isn't in the wrong because they made efforts and have the right to manage their party. But others might say A because the guest might have had valid issues. Need to weigh social norms: it's the host's space, and they can set boundaries. So probably B.\n"
