I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but not officially invited, came along with a coworker. The host noticed the guest was being awkward and not socializing. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others, but the guest kept standing alone and refused suggestions to join in. The host then told the guest to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nFirst, the host made efforts to include the guest. They asked if everything was okay, introduced him to someone with similar interests, and suggested joining a game. But the guest didn't take initiative to socialize beyond the initial help. The host's frustration comes from feeling that the guest was expecting others to make the effort for him, which is a valid concern. The host is responsible for managing the party atmosphere, and it's reasonable to expect guests to make an effort to socialize, especially when they're at a social event.\n\nThe key question is whether the host was within their rights to ask the guest to leave. The host didn't act out of malice but because the guest wasn't contributing to the social environment despite being given chances. However, the guest was a plus one, which might mean he wasn't expecting to be the center of attention. The coworker's reaction adds another layer, suggesting that the host might have overstepped by being too direct. But considering the host's efforts and the context of a party where social interaction is expected, it's understandable that the host felt the need to maintain the event's vibe.\n\nIn conclusion, the host's action was a response to the guest's lack of effort to engage. While it's possible the guest had valid social anxieties, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when the guest was given multiple opportunities to participate. The decision to ask someone to leave is a host's prerogative to ensure the event remains enjoyable for everyone.\n"
