I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The situation is that the guest was a plus one, came separately, and after a few attempts to help, the host told them to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. Hosting a party typically involves creating a welcoming environment. The host tried to integrate the guest by talking to them, introducing them to others, and suggesting activities like UNO. The guest, however, didn't engage and kept being alone. The host got annoyed because the guest wasn't making an effort beyond just complaining. \n\nNow, the key points: Was the guest given enough chance to socialize? The host did a few things to help. But is it the host's responsibility to ensure every guest is social? Maybe not. The guest might have been introverted or just not comfortable. However, the host is in charge of their home and the event's atmosphere. If someone is not contributing to the social environment and is being a burden, it's reasonable to ask them to leave. The host's actions were after multiple attempts to help, so it's not just an immediate kickout. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the host could have handled it more gracefully, like offering a private chat instead of a blunt \"leave.\" But the guest was given opportunities and refused to engage. The coworker friend's reaction is important too; maybe there's a social dynamic there. But the host's main duty is to their own event. \n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong). The host managed the situation by helping first and then setting boundaries when the guest didn't reciprocate. It's reasonable to expect guests to make some effort to socialize, especially when they've been given a chance. The host isn't obligated to force interaction beyond reasonable assistance.\n"
