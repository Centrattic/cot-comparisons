I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but maybe not officially. The guest seemed awkward, was approached by the host, introduced to someone, but then was alone again. The host tried to engage him again, but he refused to join games or mingle. The host got annoyed, told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about that.\n\nSo, the host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, but the host felt he could have just initiated conversations. The host decided to ask him to leave because it's their party and they didn't want to baby-sit.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. Well, parties are social events where guests are expected to interact, but it's not mandatory. The guest might be introverted or just not feeling social. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone, but that didn't last. The host's actions were in their own home, so they have some authority. However, telling someone to leave for not socializing might be harsh. It's possible the guest was genuinely uncomfortable, and the host didn't give enough time or options. On the other hand, the host isn't responsible for making sure every guest has fun; they can set boundaries. The coworker friend thought it was shitty, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the host was unreasonable. Since the guest didn't make an effort after being helped, the host might not be in the wrong. But maybe there's a better way to handle it without kicking someone out. However, the host has the right to enforce their party rules. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
