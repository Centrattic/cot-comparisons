I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, they had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but was more of a plus one. The person noticed this guest was standing around awkwardly. They approached him, introduced him to someone he had in common, and even suggested joining a game. But the guest refused and kept saying no one was talking to him.\n\nNow, the host got annoyed because the guest didn't make an effort to socialize. They told him to leave if he wasn't going to participate. The coworker (his friend's friend) thought it was harsh, but the host explained that they couldn't help him all night.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the host is at fault. Let's break it down. The host tried to help the guest by introducing him and suggesting activities. But the guest didn't engage. The host felt responsible but maybe had limits. However, kicking someone out for not socializing might be heavy-handed. Parties are social events, so guests are expected to participate. But is it the host's responsibility to force interaction?\n\nOn one hand, the guest might be shy or uncomfortable. The host made an effort, but maybe the guest's behavior was passive. On the other hand, no one should be forced to socialize. But the host might have the right to manage their event. Maybe the issue is the approach. Instead of kicking him out, maybe giving him space or a heads-up first. But the host did try twice. The guest's response was not making an effort. So, the host might feel justified. However, the coworker's reaction suggests it might have been too harsh. \n\nI think the host isn't entirely wrong. They tried to help, but the guest didn't engage. However, the method of removing someone might have been too abrupt. Maybe a middle ground exists. But since the host has the right to their own space, if they feel the guest isn't respecting the event's purpose, they can ask to leave. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
