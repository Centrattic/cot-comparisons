I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The host had a party and noticed a guest from the start. The guest was brought by a coworker but wasn't a plus one. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. The guest said he was being ignored again after that. The host tried again to get him involved in a game, but he refused. Then the host told him to leave, and the coworker thought it was harsh.\n\nNow, the key points here. The guest was at the party, which was meant for socializing. The host made efforts to include him twice. The guest didn't take the initiative to talk to others or participate. The host got annoyed and made him leave. The coworker criticized the host's decision.\n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. Parties are for social interaction, so guests are expected to engage. If someone isn't making an effort, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave, especially if they're affecting the atmosphere. However, it's also important to consider that some people are more introverted or shy, so the host might have handled it differently, like offering to help more or checking in again before escalating.\n\nThe host did try to help, but after the guest refused to participate, they decided to remove him. The line between being considerate and being overbearing is thin here. The host might argue that they provided enough support and the guest wasn't taking advantage of it. On the other hand, the host could have been more patient or offered another solution.\n\nThe coworker's friend might have valid feelings, but the host has the right to manage their party. If the guest was a disruption, even if not intentionally, the host's responsibility to other guests might justify the action. However, if the guest was simply shy, the host's reaction could be too harsh.\n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at intent and effort. The host tried twice to help, so maybe they're not in the wrong. But maybe the host should have given more time or alternative options. However, since the guest didn't make any effort beyond being passive, the host's decision might be justified. The answer is likely B (No), the host isn't in the wrong.\n"
