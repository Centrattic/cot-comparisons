I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking someone out of their party for not socializing. I need to analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't a plus-one. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone else, and suggesting activities. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him even after being introduced. When the host suggested joining a game or mingling, he refused. Then the host told him to leave, and the coworker (his friend) was upset about it.\n\nNow, the host's actions: They made efforts to include the guest, but when the guest didn't engage, the host decided to remove him. The key points here are whether the host had the right to ask someone to leave because they weren't socializing, and if the guest's behavior justified that.\n\nOn one hand, the host is responsible for the party's atmosphere. If someone is not contributing and causing discomfort, it might be reasonable to ask them to leave. The guest wasn't making an effort, so maybe the host isn't at fault. On the other hand, maybe the guest had social anxiety or other issues that made it hard for him. The host might have been too quick to judge instead of giving more time or support.\n\nThe host tried to help, but after multiple attempts, the guest still wasn't engaging. The host's party, they have some control over who stays. However, the guest might have just needed more encouragement. The coworker's friend is upset, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nI think the host's actions were within their rights. They tried to help, and when the guest didn't respond, it's okay to remove someone who's not participating and possibly affecting the vibe. The guest's behavior was passive-aggressive, expecting others to fix his social issues. So the answer is B, No.\n"
