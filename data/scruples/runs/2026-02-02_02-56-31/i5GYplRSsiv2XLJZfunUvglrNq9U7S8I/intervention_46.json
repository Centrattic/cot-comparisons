  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For kicking a guest out of my party for not socializing?\nThis past Friday, I had a party at my house. I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hosted a party and had a guest who didn't engage much. The guest came as a plus one but not officially. The host tried to help by introducing him to others, but he kept withdrawing. Eventually, the host told him to leave. The coworker who brought him thought the host was being harsh.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the guest's behavior versus the host's response. The host made efforts to include the guest, but when those didn't work, they decided to ask him to leave. The question is whether that was justified. \n\nOn one hand, the host is responsible for their event and has the right to manage the environment. If someone is not contributing to the social aspect and is making the host uncomfortable, it's reasonable to set boundaries. On the other hand, maybe the guest was genuinely struggling socially, and the host could have been more patient. But the guest didn't make an effort after being introduced. The host also had a coworker friend who might expect their guest to be treated kindly, but the host's time and energy are valid. \n\nSo, considering the host tried to help and the guest didn't reciprocate, the host isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
