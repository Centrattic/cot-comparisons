I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest was a plus one but came separately. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. But the guest kept standing alone and refused to engage further. The host got annoyed because the guest seemed to want others to make an effort without trying himself. Then the host told him to leave.\n\nSo, is the host at fault? Well, the host did make attempts to include the guest. The guest, on the other hand, wasn't making an effort to socialize despite the host's suggestions. The host's main point is that they can't be responsible for dragging others around. \n\nBut wait, maybe the host could have handled it more gracefully. Telling someone to leave can be harsh, but if the guest was disruptive or making others uncomfortable, it's understandable. The guest was just standing around not interacting, which might not be disruptive, but the host might feel their time is better spent elsewhere.\n\nThe coworker friend (the host's coworker) thought it was shitty, implying maybe the guest felt wronged. But the host's responsibility isn't to force others to socialize. Everyone has different comfort levels. If the guest was truly uncomfortable, he could have left on his own. The host's actions were a last resort after multiple attempts to include him failed.\n\nSo, considering the host tried to help and the guest didn't reciprocate, the host might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
