I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let's see the details.\n\nThe host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. The guest kept standing alone, said no one was talking to him, refused to join the game, and the host got annoyed. The host then told the guest to leave, and the coworker friend thought it was shitty.\n\nSo, the key points: The host made multiple efforts to include the guest, but the guest wasn't engaging. The host then asked him to leave, possibly because they felt responsible for the party's atmosphere and couldn't spend time dragging him around. The question is whether the host is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider social norms here. It's common for guests to feel awkward at parties, especially if they're not the main invitees. However, the host has the right to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing to the social environment and are disrupting the event. On the other hand, the guest might have needed more encouragement or might have had personal issues making it hard to socialize. The host tried to help, but after repeated failures, maybe it's reasonable to set boundaries. \n\nBut wait, the guest might not have been at fault either. Some people find it hard to approach others even when given opportunities. The host could have given more time or paired them with different people. However, the host also has the right to manage their own event. So, is the host in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn similar \"Am I the asshole\" scenarios, hosts are sometimes criticized for being too strict, especially if the guest wasn't causing harm beyond being quiet. But if the guest was making the host uncomfortable or affecting the party's vibe, it's a valid decision. The host's action was direct but perhaps a bit harsh. However, given that the guest wasn't making an effort, the host might not be wrong. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they tried to include the guest multiple times before deciding to ask them to leave, and it's the host's responsibility to manage their event. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's a middle ground where the host could have handled it differently without kicking them out. However, the question is whether the host is in the wrong, not whether they could have handled it better. Since the guest wasn't engaging despite efforts, the host's decision might be justified.\n"
