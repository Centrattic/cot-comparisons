I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Alright, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user hosted a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but not officially invited, came along. The guest seemed to be struggling to socialize, standing around alone. The user tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and even suggesting he join a game. However, the guest didn't engage and eventually was told to leave because he wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, the key points here are the guest's behavior and the user's response. The guest claimed he wasn't being talked to, but the user observed that he had interactions earlier. The user made efforts to integrate him but felt frustrated when he didn't reciprocate. The user then told him to leave, leading to the coworker friend being upset.\n\nTo determine if the user was in the wrong, I need to consider social norms and expectations at parties. While it's common to expect guests to make some effort to socialize, the user did try to assist. However, the line between enforcing social norms and being overbearing is thin. The guest might have felt uncomfortable or anxious, and the user's response might have been abrupt.\n\nBut on the other hand, the user had the right to manage their event. If a guest is not engaging and is a drain on the host's energy, they can ask them to leave. The user's justification was that they couldn't spend the entire time dragging the guest around. It's a balance between being considerate and maintaining the event's atmosphere.\n\nI think the user isn't entirely in the wrong because they made genuine attempts to include the guest. However, the approach could have been more empathetic. Maybe a gentler way to ask him to leave, considering the guest's possible social anxiety. But in the end, the user's actions were within their rights to manage their party. So, the answer is B.\n"
