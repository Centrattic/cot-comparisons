I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hosted the party is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The host had invited friends and coworkers, and this guy came with a coworker but they arrived separately. The host tried to help him by talking to him, introducing him to others, and even suggesting activities. But the guest kept standing alone and refused to engage. The host then told him to leave, and the guest did.\n\nHmm, so the host tried multiple times to include the guest. The guest's behavior was causing discomfort, maybe even being passive-aggressive by not making an effort. The host might feel that the guest was taking up their time and resources without contributing. On the other hand, maybe the host was too abrupt in asking him to leave. But the host did make an effort first. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was shitty, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nIs it the host's responsibility to ensure everyone is socializing? Well, they can't force someone to interact. The guest might have personal issues or social anxiety. However, the host is also responsible for the environment they set. If the guest was disruptive or uncooperative, maybe the host was justified. But kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh. However, the host did give multiple chances. The key points are the host's attempts to help and the guest's refusal to engage. So the host might not be in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
