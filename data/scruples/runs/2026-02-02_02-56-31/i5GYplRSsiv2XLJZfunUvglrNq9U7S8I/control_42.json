I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party, a guest came with a coworker but wasn't really a plus one. He was standing around, didn't socialize, asked for help, got introduced to someone, but then went back to being alone. The host tried to get him to join activities, but he refused. Then the host told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset but the host explained that the guest wasn't trying.\n\nSo, the host's perspective: they tried to help, but the guest wasn't making an effort. The guest kept saying no one is talking to him but didn't approach others. The host felt it was their responsibility to have a functional party and couldn't help someone who wasn't trying.\n\nThe guest's perspective: maybe he felt uncomfortable, couldn't socialize that night, or maybe he's shy. But he did ask for help, so maybe he needed more support.\n\nNow, the question is whether the host was wrong. The host is the one hosting their own party, so they have the right to set boundaries. However, they did try to help by introducing him and suggesting activities. The guest didn't make an effort beyond the initial help. The host's action was firm, but maybe they overstepped? Or was it reasonable?\n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong because they made attempts to integrate the guest, and when those failed, taking action to maintain the party's atmosphere is understandable. The guest was expected to make some effort, and since he didn't, the host's decision to ask him to leave is justified. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
