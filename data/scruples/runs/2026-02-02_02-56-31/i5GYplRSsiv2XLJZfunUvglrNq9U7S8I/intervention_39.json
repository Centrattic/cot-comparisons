I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they hosted a party, a guest came along as a plus one but not officially. The guest seemed to be standing around not socializing. The host approached him a couple of times, tried to help, but the guest didn't engage. Then the host told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The question is whether that's acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. They put effort into the party, had friends and coworkers there. They tried to help the guest by introducing him to others and suggesting activities. The guest, on the other hand, didn't take the initiative. The host got annoyed and decided he should leave. But was that justifiable?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest was shy or uncomfortable. Even if he didn't take the initiative, the host's response of telling him to leave might be too harsh. The guest might not be the problem; maybe others at the party weren't engaging him. The host is the one hosting the event, so they have some responsibility to ensure all guests feel welcomed. However, there's a limit to how much the host can do for each individual guest. \n\nAlso, the guest came as a plus one but not officially invited. If the host didn't know he'd be there, maybe they didn't plan for him. The host might not feel responsible for his comfort. But still, once he's there, it's polite to make him feel included. However, the host isn't obligated to force interactions. \n\nThe key points are: the host tried to help, the guest didn't take the initiative. The host's party, so they have some authority. But kicking someone out for not socializing might come off as rude. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like giving a warning or not confronting. But the host did try multiple times. \n\nSo, is the host in the wrong? If the guest was not making an effort, maybe the host isn't. But if the host's party environment is supposed to be social, and someone isn't contributing and is a burden, then maybe it's okay. Alternatively, the host could have handled it more gracefully. The answer might be a nuanced 'no' because the host tried and the guest wasn't cooperating. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
