I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Hmm. First, I need to understand the situation. They had a party with friends and coworkers, and a guest came with a coworker. The guest was standing around alone, and the user tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone. Then the guest was alone again, and when given options to join a game or mingle, he refused. The user got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker later thought it was harsh.\n\nNow, the user wants to know if they're at fault. Let me break it down. Hosting a party comes with certain expectations, right? You can't force someone to socialize, but if someone is there and not contributing or making an effort, maybe it's reasonable to set boundaries. The guest was given chances to engage but didn't take them. The user tried to help, but after repeated refusals, they decided the guest wasn't respecting the social environment.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest was just shy or nervous. But the user did try to assist. The key points are whether the guest made an effort. If he refused to participate even after being offered help, maybe the user is justified. Also, the party is the user's space, so they have the right to manage the atmosphere. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I need to make sure. Maybe some might think it's unkind, but the user tried to help. The coworker's reaction is a point, but the user's explanation seems valid. I think B makes sense here.\n"
