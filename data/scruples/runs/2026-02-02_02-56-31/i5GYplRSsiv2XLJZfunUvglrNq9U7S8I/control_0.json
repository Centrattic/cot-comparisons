I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a party and a guest who was a plus one but not really. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after the author tried to help by introducing him to a friend and suggesting activities. The guest didn't engage and eventually the author kicked him out. The coworker friend was upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was reasonable. The guest was a plus one but maybe not invited directly. The author tried to include him twice\u2014first by talking to him, then introducing him to someone, and suggesting joining a game. But the guest refused both times. The author felt that the guest wasn't making an effort, just wanted attention. So they told him to leave.\n\nIs it the guest's fault for not socializing? Well, some people are naturally more introverted or nervous in social settings. Maybe the guest wasn't trying to be difficult but just felt out of place. The author's actions could be seen as harsh if they didn't give enough time or if the guest had a valid reason for not engaging. However, the author was also hosting a party and might have a right to set boundaries, especially if someone's presence is affecting others.\n\nAlso, the coworker friend was upset that the author told the guest to leave. That might indicate that the author's approach was too abrupt. Maybe there were other ways to handle it, like talking to the guest more gently or asking the coworker to assist. But the author felt it was necessary to remove the guest because they weren't contributing to the social environment and were being passive.\n\nAnother angle: the author's responsibility as a host. Hosts often encourage guests to mingle but aren't obligated to force interactions. However, if a guest is clearly disruptive or not following basic social cues, the host might have the right to ask them to leave. The key here is whether the guest was making any effort. The author tried to help, but the guest didn't engage. If someone is just waiting for others to approach, maybe it's on them.\n\nBut wait, sometimes social anxiety can make it hard for people to approach others. The guest might have been in that situation. Did the author give enough time for the guest to adjust? Maybe not. But the author also has to manage their own time and the atmosphere of the party.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author tried to assist, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the host decided to remove them. It's a bit of a grey area. If the guest was truly trying their best and the host acted out of frustration, then maybe the host is at fault. But if the guest was just being passive, then the host might be justified. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they made efforts to include the guest and the guest didn't respond. The host has the right to set the tone of their party. However, maybe a more diplomatic approach could have been better. But given the circumstances, the author's actions might be understandable. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
