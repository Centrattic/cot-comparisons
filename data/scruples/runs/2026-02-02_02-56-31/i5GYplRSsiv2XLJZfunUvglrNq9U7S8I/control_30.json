I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a party where the host kicked out a guest for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The guest was a plus one of a coworker, but they came separately. The host noticed the guest was standing around awkwardly and tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone else, and suggesting activities. However, after a couple of attempts, the guest was still isolated and the host got annoyed, telling him to leave. The coworker friend later criticized the host, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nNow, considering social etiquette and responsibility. The host tried to assist the guest initially, which is good. But the guest didn't take initiative after being introduced. The host had a party to manage, so it's reasonable they couldn't spend all their time on one person. However, kicking someone out for not socializing might seem harsh. But the guest wasn't causing trouble beyond being isolated. Social events can be stressful, and some people might struggle to engage. The host's frustration is understandable, but is it their responsibility to ensure everyone is socializing?\n\nOn one hand, the host isn't obligated to force interactions. On the other, the guest might have felt anxious and needed more time. The host's actions could be seen as dismissive. However, the guest was given opportunities and didn't take them. The host's main responsibility is to their own event and other guests. Maybe the alternative would be to let the guest stay but not actively push them out. But since the guest was unresponsive, the host's decision to ask them to leave might be justified as they can't cater to every individual's needs.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the host made efforts to help, the guest didn't engage, and the host has the right to manage their event. But some might argue it's harsh to kick someone out for not socializing. However, the host isn't obligated to make others comfortable beyond a certain point.\n"
