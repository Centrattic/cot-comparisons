  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For kicking a guest out of my party for not socializing?\nThis past Friday, I had a party at my house. I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The situation is a bit tricky.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but not really, so maybe he wasn't expected to be there. He came with a coworker's friend. The host tried to help him by talking to him, introducing him to others, suggesting activities, but he kept standing alone. The host got annoyed because the guest wasn't making an effort and told him to leave. The coworker (the friend of the guest) thought it was harsh, but the host defended their decision.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the guest make an effort? The host tried multiple times to help him integrate. The guest refused to participate in the game and didn't try to mingle. The host isn't obligated to force social interactions, especially if the guest is being passive. However, the guest might have been uncomfortable or just a quiet person. But the host is responsible for the party's atmosphere and other guests' enjoyment. If someone is causing discomfort by not engaging, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The host did try to assist, and when that didn't work, removing the person isn't necessarily wrong. On the other hand, maybe the guest had reasons for not participating, but the host isn't responsible for every guest's comfort. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
