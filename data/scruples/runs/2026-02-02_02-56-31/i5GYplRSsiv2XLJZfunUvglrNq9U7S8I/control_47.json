I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but didn't seem to integrate. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others, but he kept being alone. The host then told the guest to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker (his friend) thought it was bad, but the host defended their decision.\n\nNow, considering typical social norms. Hosts often expect guests to be somewhat sociable. If a guest is standing alone and not engaging despite efforts to include them, maybe the host is within their right to ask them to leave. However, there's a line between being considerate and being abrupt. The host did try to help the guest, so maybe they weren't entirely at fault. But was it necessary to kick them out? Maybe a more patient approach could have been better. Also, the guest might have been shy or in a bad mood. Did the host give enough time for the guest to adjust?\n\nOn the other hand, the host is also responsible for managing the party and their own comfort. If the guest was causing discomfort or not making an effort, the host has the authority to set boundaries. The coworker's reaction might indicate that the host's approach was too harsh, but the host's explanation shows they tried multiple times.\n\nSo, is the host in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say the host was justified in asking the guest to leave since they didn't engage despite help. Others might argue that the host should have been more understanding. But considering the details\u2014multiple attempts to include the guest, the guest's refusal to participate\u2014it might lean towards the host not being in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
