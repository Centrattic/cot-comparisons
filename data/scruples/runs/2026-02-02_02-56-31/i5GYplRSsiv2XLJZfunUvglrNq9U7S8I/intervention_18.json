  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For kicking a guest out of my party for not socializing?\nThis past Friday, I had a party at my house. I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The host had a party and a guest who kept being isolated. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else, but the guest kept standing alone. When the host asked him to leave, the coworker friend was upset.\n\nFirst, the host made an effort to integrate the guest by talking to him and connecting him with someone else. The guest's response was to withdraw again. The host's frustration is understandable, especially if the guest wasn't trying to socialize despite the efforts. The host isn't obligated to force interactions, and if the guest is content being alone, maybe the problem is on his side. However, kicking someone out for not socializing might come off as harsh, even if the guest wasn't making an effort. The host might have alternatives like offering to play a game with him instead of just sending him away. But considering the guest's repeated lack of engagement and the host's responsibility to manage the party, it's a tough call. The key is whether the host gave enough opportunities for the guest to engage. The host did try twice, so maybe not in the wrong.\n"
