I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a party, a guest was invited as a plus-one but maybe not officially. The guest was standing around alone a couple of times, the host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others. The guest claimed no one was talking to him, even after being introduced. When the host suggested joining a game or mingling, the guest refused. The host got annoyed and told the guest to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The guest left, and the host's coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was harsh, but the host explained that they didn't have time to force interactions.\n\nSo, the host is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA). Need to decide between A or B. \n\nConsidering the facts: The host made an effort to integrate the guest by talking to him and introducing him. The guest didn't take initiative beyond the initial help. The host felt the guest was expecting others to make an effort, which wasn't fair. The host's responsibility is to their own party, so if someone isn't contributing or engaging despite some assistance, it's reasonable to set a boundary. However, maybe the host could have handled it more gracefully, but the action of kicking them out might be justified given the circumstances. \n\nPossible angles: Is it the host's responsibility to ensure all guests socialize? Or is it the guest's responsibility to make an effort? The host isn't a social planner, but if someone is clearly unengaged and disruptive, removing them could be reasonable. Also, the guest was a plus-one, so maybe the host didn't have a strong obligation to include them beyond initial attempts. \n\nThe key points are that the host tried to help, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the host felt it was unfair to spend more time managing this. The coworker friend's reaction might be a red herring; the host has the right to manage their own event. So, likely the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to ensure there's no cultural or social norm I'm missing here. In many social contexts, expecting guests to at least try to socialize is reasonable, especially in a party setting. If someone refuses all efforts, the host isn't wrong to ask them to leave. So yeah, B makes sense.\n"
