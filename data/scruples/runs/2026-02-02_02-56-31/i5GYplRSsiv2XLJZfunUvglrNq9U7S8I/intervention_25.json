I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person had a party and invited friends and coworkers. One guest was a plus one but arrived separately. The host noticed the guest was standing around and tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities. The guest didn't engage and kept complaining about not being talked to. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. Now the host is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So first, the host tried several times to help the guest socialize. They asked if everything was okay, talked to him, introduced him to someone with similar interests, suggested joining a game. The guest didn't take the initiative and kept being passive. The host's reasoning for asking him to leave is that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize, and the host didn't have time to force interactions.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, parties can be stressful for some people. Maybe the guest was shy or had social anxiety. But the host did make an effort to help. However, if the guest refused to engage despite the host's help, maybe it's reasonable to expect some reciprocity. The host isn't obligated to baby-sit someone who isn't contributing to the social environment. On the other hand, maybe the guest was just in a bad mood or not feeling well, but that doesn't mean the host is wrong for setting a boundary.\n\nThe coworker friend's reaction was that it was \"shitty\" to ask him to leave. But the host explained that they tried, and the guest wasn't making an effort. The host is the one hosting the party, so they have the right to set the tone and manage the environment. If someone is making the host uncomfortable or not adhering to the social norms of the party, the host can enforce rules. In this case, the guest wasn't following through on the social aspects, which are part of the expectation at a party. So the host's response might be justified. But maybe there's a middle ground, like offering the guest a chance to leave on their own terms instead of directly telling them to go. However, the host did give multiple chances. \n\nI think the key points are: host tried to integrate the guest, guest refused to engage, host set a boundary. So the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
