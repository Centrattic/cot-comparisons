I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party because that guest wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker, not as a plus one. The guest seemed awkward, and the author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. But the guest kept standing alone, refused to join the game, and said no one was talking to him. The author got annoyed, told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nNow, considering if the author is wrong. The key points here are the guest's behavior versus the host's responsibility. The author made efforts to include the guest, like talking to him and introducing him. But the guest didn't reciprocate by making an effort to socialize. The author might feel that the guest is being passive and expecting others to approach him without trying himself.\n\nHowever, as a host, maybe the expectation is that guests should be able to socialize on their own. But the guest was clearly uncomfortable. The author's actions of asking if he was okay and trying to help were good. But when the guest kept being isolated, the host might have felt it's beyond their control. Is it fair to kick someone out for not socializing? That could be seen as harsh, especially if the guest had social anxiety or wasn't used to such environments. However, the author did give multiple chances and tried to help.\n\nOn the other hand, the host isn't obligated to force interactions. The guest might have felt that the party wasn't welcoming, but the host did take steps to integrate him. The line between being a good host and not being responsible for every guest's social needs is blurry here. If the guest's behavior was affecting others or the host's ability to enjoy the party, it might justify the action. But in this case, it seems the host's patience was tested, leading to the decision to ask the guest to leave.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a bit harsh, but maybe understandable. However, in terms of being in the wrong, it's a judgment call. The host might not be entirely at fault because they tried to help, but kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as not being considerate enough. Alternatively, it's their party, and they can set boundaries. I'm leaning towards not in the wrong because the host made efforts and the guest didn't reciprocate. But the answer might depend on cultural or personal norms about hosting.\n"
