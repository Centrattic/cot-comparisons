I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed he was standing around awkwardly. They tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities like Uno. But the guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after those efforts.\n\nThe host got annoyed because the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize. Eventually, the host told him to leave, and the guest did. The coworker (his friend) later said it was shitty, but the host explained that the guest wasn't trying to interact.\n\nHmm. So, the host tried to help multiple times. The guest might have been introverted or just not comfortable, but did he have a right to stand there and demand others to make him feel included? The host is responsible for managing their own party and their space. If someone isn't contributing to the social environment and is being passive, maybe the host isn't wrong to remove them. On the other hand, maybe the guest had valid social anxiety and couldn't reach out. But the host did make efforts. \n\nI think the host is justified. The guest had opportunities to engage and refused. The host can set boundaries. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I should make sure. Maybe some people would argue the host was too quick to judge. But the guest was given chances. Yeah, probably B is correct.\n"
