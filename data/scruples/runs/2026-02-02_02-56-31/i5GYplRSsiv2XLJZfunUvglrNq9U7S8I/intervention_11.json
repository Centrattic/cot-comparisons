I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, the setup: the guest was a plus-one but came separately. The host noticed the guest was awkward, tried to help by introducing them to someone with similar interests, but after a few minutes, the guest was alone again. The host suggested joining a game or mingling, but the guest refused. Then the host told him to leave.\n\nFrom the host's perspective, they made an effort to include the guest. The guest's behavior, according to the host, was passive and uncooperative. The host felt it was the guest's responsibility to engage, not the host's to force interaction. The coworker friend was disappointed, but the host defended their decision.\n\nNow, considering social norms and responsibilities. As a host, it's expected to make guests feel welcome, but it's also reasonable to expect guests to make some effort. If someone is completely unengaged and refuses all attempts to integrate, the host isn't obligated to keep them around. The host didn't act out of malice; they tried to help and set boundaries when the guest wasn't meeting them halfway.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the guest could have been socially anxious or needed more time. However, the guest had two opportunities to engage and declined both. The host's actions were direct but not hostile. The key point is that the host isn't responsible for the guest's discomfort beyond a reasonable effort to assist. So, the host isn't in the wrong here.\n"
