I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The guest was a plus one but not really, meaning maybe not officially invited. The user noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by introducing him to a friend and suggesting activities. But the guest kept isolating himself despite the efforts. The user got annoyed because the guest seemed to want others to fix his social issues without trying himself. Then, the user told him to leave if he's just going to stand around. The coworker (his friend) was upset, but the user defended their decision.\n\nNow, to evaluate if the user is in the wrong. The key points are whether the user was within their rights to ask someone to leave and if the guest's behavior justified that action. The user did make efforts to include the guest, but the guest didn't reciprocate. Social events require mutual effort. However, asking someone to leave can come off as harsh, especially if the guest is genuinely uncomfortable. But the user might feel responsible for the event's atmosphere and their own time.\n\nPossible angles: Hosts can set boundaries. If someone is disruptive or not contributing, it's okay to ask them to leave. But if the guest is just being introverted, forcing them out might be unfair. However, in this case, the guest was given multiple chances to engage and refused. The user's actions could be seen as reasonable to maintain the party's vibe.\n\nAnother angle: Some might argue that the user should have been more patient or found another way to help the guest integrate. But others might agree that it's the guest's responsibility to participate.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the user tried to help and the guest didn't make an effort. The host has the authority to manage their event.\n"
