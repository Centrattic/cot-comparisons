  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For kicking a guest out of my party for not socializing?\nThis past Friday, I had a party at my house. I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their party because that guest wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus-one, came separately, and kept being standoffish.\n\nFirst, the host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. But after that, the guest kept standing alone and refused suggestions to join activities. The host got frustrated because the guest wasn't making an effort, so they told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nSo, is the host in the wrong? Well, they did make an effort to include the guest. The guest wasn't engaging, maybe was self-isolating. The host probably felt they couldn't spend all their time helping him. But on the other hand, maybe the guest had social anxiety or just wasn't in the mood. Telling someone to leave might seem harsh, especially if they felt excluded. But the host is also responsible for their own event and their comfort.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. However, the host did try to integrate the guest. If the guest continued to be unresponsive and refused to participate, maybe the host had the right to ask him to leave. They're not obligated to force interactions. So probably the answer is B, the host isn't in the wrong.\n"
