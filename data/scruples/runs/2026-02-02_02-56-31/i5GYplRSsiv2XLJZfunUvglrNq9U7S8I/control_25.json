I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The scenario involves a party where the guest was a plus one but came separately. The host tried to help him by introducing him to others and suggesting activities, but the guest kept standing alone. The host then told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's actions. They did attempt to integrate the guest by talking to him, introducing him to a friend with similar interests, and suggesting a game. The guest didn't engage beyond that. The host was presumably managing a party, which requires balancing the comfort of all guests. If one guest is not contributing and is becoming a burden, the host might feel justified in removing them to maintain the event's atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might be shy or have social anxiety. The host's approach of telling him to leave could be seen as harsh, especially if the guest truly couldn't engage socially. However, the host also has the right to enforce some level of social participation, especially if the guest is not making any effort. The coworker friend's reaction might indicate a difference in social expectations, but the host's responsibility includes ensuring the party runs smoothly for everyone. The key points are the host's attempts to help and the guest's lack of effort. The decision to ask him to leave seems reasonable given the circumstances, so the answer would be B.\n"
