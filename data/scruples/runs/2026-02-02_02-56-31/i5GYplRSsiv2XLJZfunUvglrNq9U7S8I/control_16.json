I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about hosting a party and kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. One guest was a plus one but came separately. The guest seemed uncomfortable, was approached by the host, introduced to someone, but then ended up alone again. The host tried to engage him with a game and suggested mingling, but he refused. Eventually, the host told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nSo, the host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't trying to socialize, just wanted attention without effort. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, but the host saw opportunities for interaction. The host felt it was their right to ask him to leave if he wasn't contributing to the party. The coworker thought it was mean, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Hosting a party usually requires creating a welcoming environment. However, guests are expected to make some effort to socialize. If someone is clearly not trying, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave, especially if it's affecting the event's atmosphere. On the flip side, some might argue that the host should have been more patient or found another way to help the guest integrate.\n\nThe key points are: the guest was provided with opportunities to engage, refused assistance, and the host took action to maintain the party's flow. The host isn't obligated to force social interactions, and if the guest's behavior is affecting others, removal could be reasonable. However, it's also important to consider if the host handled it politely or if there was a better approach.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The host's intent was to help initially, then to enforce social participation. The guest's refusal might be due to shyness or other factors, but the host's responsibility is to their event. So, the host isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
