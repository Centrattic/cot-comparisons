I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. They described the situation where a guest, who was a plus one but not really a plus one, was standing around alone. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him even after being introduced and given options. The host then got annoyed and told him to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. Hosting a party involves ensuring guests have a good time, but it's also their home. They can set boundaries. The guest was given multiple chances to engage but didn't make an effort. The host tried to help, so maybe they're not being unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have felt uncomfortable, and maybe the host's reaction was too harsh. However, the guest was an outsider who wasn't part of the core group. The host isn't obligated to force interaction. If the guest was being disruptive or causing discomfort, removing them makes sense. \n\nThe host's coworker friend (the guest's plus one) thought it was shitty, but the host explained their reasoning. The key here is whether the host acted unreasonably. Since the guest wasn't trying to socialize and the host tried to help, maybe it's justified. The host isn't responsible for the guest's social skills. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
