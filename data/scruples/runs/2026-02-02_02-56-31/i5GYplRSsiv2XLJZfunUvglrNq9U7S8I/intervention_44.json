I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. I need to figure out whether answer A or B is correct.\n\nFirst, the situation: The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. One guest was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed the guest was standing around alone, tried to help by introducing them to someone else, but the guest kept being isolated. The host got annoyed and told them to leave. The guest left, and the coworker friend was upset.\n\nSo, the host tried to help the guest by talking to them and introducing them to someone with similar interests. The guest then went back to being alone, refused to join activities or mingle. The host felt the guest was being passive and not making an effort. The host's reasoning was that if the guest wasn't making an effort, they could leave.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette: It's common for guests at a party to be expected to engage, but there's also a balance. Some people are shy or introverted. However, in this case, the guest had opportunities to socialize and chose not to. The host did make an effort to help, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host's party is their space, and they have the right to set boundaries, especially if someone is not contributing to the social environment and is affecting the host's experience.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the host didn't give the guest enough time or options. Maybe the guest was just shy and needed more encouragement. But the guest did have multiple chances and refused help. The host also mentions not having time to drag the guest around. So, the host's perspective is that it's the guest's responsibility to engage.\n\nThe host's actions: After several attempts to integrate the guest, the host decided to ask them to leave. It's a judgment call. If the guest was genuinely uncomfortable and tried to engage but failed, the host might be at fault. But if the guest is making no effort and is uncooperative, the host isn't in the wrong for protecting their event.\n\nAlso, the coworker (the guest's friend) was upset, but the host explained their reasoning. The key here is whether the host overstepped. Since the host is the one hosting the party, they have the authority to set the tone and manage the environment. If someone is not adhering to the social norms of the event, the host can ask them to leave.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the host is not in the wrong). The host tried to help, the guest didn't make an effort, and the host enforced their boundaries.\n"
