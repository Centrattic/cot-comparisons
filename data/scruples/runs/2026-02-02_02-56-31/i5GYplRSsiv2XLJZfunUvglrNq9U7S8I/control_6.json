I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guest was a plus one but not officially invited. The author tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but the guest kept being passive. The author told him to leave when he wasn't engaging.\n\nThe guest's behavior: He came alone, didn't take the initiative to talk to others after being introduced once, and refused suggested activities. He kept saying no one was talking to him, even after being helped. The author felt he wasn't making an effort and that it wasn't the host's responsibility to constantly facilitate his interactions.\n\nPossible angles: Hosts aren't responsible for ensuring every guest is entertained. If someone isn't contributing or making an effort, it's reasonable to ask them to leave, especially if it's affecting the party's atmosphere. The guest was a plus one, which might mean he wasn't expected to be the center of attention. However, the host's response was direct and maybe abrupt. But considering the host's perspective, they had a right to manage their own party environment.\n\nCounterpoints: Some might say the host should be more accommodating. But the host tried multiple times. The guest's refusal to engage after being assisted could justify the host's decision. The key is whether the host acted unreasonably. The host didn't act aggressively; they gave multiple chances. So the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
