I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The scenario is that the guest was a plus one but not really, came with a coworker, and at the party, the guest kept standing around alone even after being introduced and offered to join activities. The user got annoyed and told the guest to leave if he wasn't going to engage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. As the host, it's reasonable to expect guests to participate, but there's a line. The guest might be introverted or uncomfortable, so maybe the host should have given more time or encouragement. However, the guest was given multiple opportunities to join in and refused. The host tried introducing them to others and suggested activities, but the guest didn't take initiative.\n\nThe user's main argument is that the guest wasn't making an effort and wanted others to accommodate him. They felt they had to set a boundary because they couldn't keep facilitating interactions. The coworker friend thought it was harsh, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nNow, considering cultural norms, sometimes people might feel awkward at parties even if they're friendly. The guest's behavior could be seen as not respecting the host's efforts. However, kicking someone out might come off as abrupt. Did the host handle it respectfully? The user did talk to the guest, tried to help, and then gave a direct order. It's possible that a more gentle approach could have been taken, but the host's right to manage their own party is important.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have had valid reasons for being shy or anxious. The host might have overstepped, but the guest also didn't put in any effort. It's a balance. The user might not be in the wrong because they tried to help and then set a boundary when it wasn't working. However, others might argue that forcing someone to leave is harsh. \n\nI think the key points are that the host made efforts to include the guest and the guest didn't reciprocate. The host had the right to ask someone to leave if they weren't contributing to the party atmosphere. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground. However, since the user followed up with the coworker and explained, perhaps the host acted within their rights. So the answer is B.\n"
