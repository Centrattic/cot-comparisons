I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their party. Let me see what the situation is.\n\nSo, the host had a party, and there was a guest who was kind of a plus one but not officially. The guest kept standing around alone and said no one was talking to him. The host tried to introduce him to someone, but after a few minutes, he was alone again. The host then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort to socialize.\n\nHmm. The host is wondering if that was the right call. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to think about social norms and expectations at a party. The host is responsible for making guests feel comfortable, but also has the right to manage their own event. The guest in question might have been shy or uncomfortable, but the host tried to help. However, when the guest didn't take initiative after being introduced, maybe the host felt it was time to ask him to leave.\n\nBut did the guest really do something wrong? Maybe he was just introverted or had social anxiety. On the other hand, the host isn't obligated to force conversation or keep someone around if they're not engaging. The guest was given chances to interact but didn't take them. The host might have felt it's unfair to spend time dragging someone into conversations when they have their own guests to attend to.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the host should be more understanding. But the host also has the right to set boundaries. If the guest was being a burden, then maybe it's justified. The key points are the guest's lack of effort and the host's attempts to help before deciding to ask him to leave.\n\nIn similar situations, people often suggest that hosts should be patient, but there's a balance. The host isn't a social planner; they can't be responsible for every guest's interactions. So the host's action might be seen as reasonable, not in the wrong. So the answer would lean towards B.\n"
