I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The party was at their house, they invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but wasn't really one. The user noticed he was alone and tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests. But then the guy kept standing alone again, refused to join activities, and the user got annoyed. They told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker who was his friend thought it was mean, but the user explained their reasoning.\n\nNow, the key points here. The user tried to help the guest integrate. They offered a conversation, an introduction, and suggested joining a game. The guest didn't engage and kept being passive. The user felt the guest was expecting others to make an effort for him. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, hosting a party comes with certain responsibilities, but guests also have a role in engaging. It's unreasonable to expect the host to constantly manage every guest's social interactions. The user did their part, but when the guest refused to participate, maybe the user was within their right to ask him to leave, especially if it was affecting the party's atmosphere.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the user was abrupt. Even if the guest wasn't socializing, maybe they should have given more time or handled it more gently. But considering the user tried multiple times and the guest was unresponsive, the user's frustration is understandable. \n\nAlso, the coworker's friend thought it was mean, but the user explained the situation. So the user's reasoning is that it's not their job to force socialization. The guest had the choice to engage or stay quiet. Since he didn't put in effort, the user decided to end the situation by asking him to leave.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But in most social norms, guests are expected to make some effort to participate. If someone is completely passive and unresponsive, the host isn't wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
