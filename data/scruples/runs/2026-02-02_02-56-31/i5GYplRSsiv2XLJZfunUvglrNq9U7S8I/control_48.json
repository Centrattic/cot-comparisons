I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, the situation: The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but maybe wasn't officially invited. The guest stood around alone, said no one was talking to him, the host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but he refused. Eventually, the host told him to leave. The host's coworker (his friend) thought it was bad, but the host defended their decision.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The guest was a plus one, which might not be explicitly permitted. The host tried multiple times to help him integrate, but he didn't reciprocate. The host's responsibility is to manage the party, not to force social interactions. If someone isn't engaging despite efforts, it's reasonable for the host to ask them to leave to maintain the party's atmosphere. However, some might argue that the guest's discomfort isn't the host's fault, and maybe more time or different approaches could help. But the host did make attempts, and the guest's refusal to participate could be seen as a choice. The host's decision to ask the guest to leave isn't necessarily malicious. The coworker's disapproval might come from a different perspective, but the host has the right to set boundaries. So, the host isn't in the wrong.\n"
