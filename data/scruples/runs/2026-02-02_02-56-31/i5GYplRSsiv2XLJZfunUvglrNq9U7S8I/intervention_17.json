I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The guest was a plus one, not officially invited. The user noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by introducing him to someone else. But the guest kept isolating himself, refused to join activities, and when told to leave, he did. The user's reasoning was that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize and the user didn't have time to force interactions.\n\nSo, first, the guest was a plus one but came separately. That might mean the user didn't expect him to be there. The user tried a couple of times to help him integrate but he didn't respond. The user felt annoyed because the guest was passive and wanted others to make the effort. The user's main argument is that the guest wasn't trying, so they had to ask him to leave. The coworker friend was upset, but the user explained their reasoning.\n\nNow, considering the details. Was the user wrong? Well, the guest was there without being a direct invitee, so maybe the user felt responsible for their inclusion. But the user did make an effort to help. The guest's behavior was passive, not engaging. The user's response was to ask him to leave after multiple failed attempts. The user's main responsibility is to the other guests and the party's atmosphere. If someone isn't contributing and is causing discomfort, maybe it's reasonable to ask them to leave. However, the user might have overstepped, but given the context, it could be seen as a reasonable action. The key is whether the user had a right to enforce social engagement. Since it's their party, they have some authority over the environment. The guest's refusal to participate might justify the action. So the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
