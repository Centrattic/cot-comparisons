I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking someone out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. So, first, I need to consider the situation from all angles.\n\nThe guest was a plus one but not officially invited. The host noticed him standing alone and tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. That person talked to him briefly, but then he was alone again. The host made suggestions like joining a game or mingling, but the guest refused. The host then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort to socialize.\n\nNow, the key points here. The host tried to assist the guest by introducing him and offering activities. The guest, however, didn't engage and maybe was being passive. The host felt that the guest was expecting others to make an effort for him and decided to cut the interaction off. The coworker friend was upset about the guest being told to leave.\n\nIs the host wrong? Well, hosting a party means managing the environment. If a guest is not participating and is causing discomfort, the host has the right to ask them to leave, especially if they're not making an effort. However, the guest might have felt anxious or uncomfortable, which isn't uncommon. The host did make attempts to include the guest, so maybe there's a balance here.\n\nBut the guest's refusal to engage and the host's responsibility to the other guests could justify their actions. It's possible that the host isn't in the wrong because they tried to help and the guest didn't reciprocate. However, some might argue that the host could have been more patient or offered more support. Still, the host has the right to enforce social behavior at their own party. So, I think the answer leans towards the host not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
