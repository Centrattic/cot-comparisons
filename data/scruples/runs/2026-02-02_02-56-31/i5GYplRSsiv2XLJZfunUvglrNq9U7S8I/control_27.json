I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author was in the wrong here. So the situation is: they had a party, a guest came with a coworker but was sort of a plus one. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after the author tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities. Then the author told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the guest's perspective. He might have felt out of place or maybe he's not a social person. But the author tried to help, right? They asked if he was okay, talked to him, introduced him to someone, and suggested joining a game. The guest refused both times. So the author's actions were proactive in trying to help. \n\nNow, the key points here are whether the guest was making an effort. The author noticed that after being introduced and suggested to join a game, he just stood around again. That could imply he wasn't putting in the effort to socialize. If that's the case, maybe the author was justified in asking him to leave because the party was for others too, and they couldn't be expected to cater to his discomfort all night.\n\nBut wait, maybe the guest was just really shy or maybe there was a cultural difference in social norms. The author might have overstepped by kicking him out, even if he wasn't engaging. Social anxiety can be a real issue, and expecting someone to \"just mingle\" might be unfair. However, the author did try a couple of times to help. \n\nThen there's the coworker friend's reaction. She said it was \"shitty\" to tell him to leave. That might indicate that others see it as harsh. But the author explained that they didn't want to be responsible for dragging him into conversations. Hosts do have the right to set boundaries, especially if a guest is being a burden.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author tried to help but the guest didn't reciprocate. The author's party, their house rules. Maybe it's not wrong to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing and causing discomfort. But maybe the author could have handled it more gracefully, like giving him more time or finding another way to include him. However, in the end, the author's actions were a response to the guest's lack of effort, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
