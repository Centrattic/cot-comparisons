I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but not officially invited. The host noticed the guest was standing alone and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. After that, the guest was alone again. The host tried suggesting activities like joining a game, but the guest refused. Then the host told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker (his friend) was upset about it.\n\nI need to consider whether the host was justified. The guest might have felt awkward, but the host tried to help. The guest didn't take initiative to mingle despite being given opportunities. Hosts have the right to manage their event, especially if someone is not contributing to the social environment. But maybe the host could have handled it more gently? But the guest was given multiple chances. The host's main point is that they don't have time to drag people around. It's a judgment call. Social norms often expect guests to make some effort. The host isn't obligated to force interactions. So maybe the host is in the right. Answer B.\n"
