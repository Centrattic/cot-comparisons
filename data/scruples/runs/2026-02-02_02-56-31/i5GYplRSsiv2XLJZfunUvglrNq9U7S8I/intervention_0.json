I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, the context: The party was at their house, they invited friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but came separately. He was awkward, approached by the host, introduced to someone, but then became isolated again. The host tried to engage him but he refused, leading to the host telling him to leave.\n\nSo, the user is wondering if they handled it correctly. Let's break it down. The guest was there with a coworker's permission, but maybe as a plus one wasn't explicitly allowed. The host had the right to set boundaries. The guest didn't make an effort to socialize despite being offered help. The host felt the guest was being passive and not taking initiative. \n\nNow, possible angles: Was the guest really being antisocial, or was he shy? The host tried to help, but maybe the guest had social anxiety. But the host also had the right to manage their event. If the guest wasn't making an effort, maybe the host isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe the host was too quick to judge. \n\nIn the story, the user says they talked to the guest, introduced him, offered to play games, but he refused. That shows the host tried. The guest's repeated withdrawal might indicate he wasn't comfortable, but that's not the host's fault. The host has the authority to set the tone of their party. \n\nAlso, the coworker (his friend) was informed, and she was upset, but the host explained their reasoning. The host might have a valid point that they can't force socialization. However, kicking someone out for being shy or not engaging could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut the key here is that the guest was given multiple chances and opportunities to engage, but chose not to. The host is not obligated to host a guest who's not participating and might be affecting the atmosphere. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). The host made reasonable efforts to include the guest, but when the guest refused to participate, the host had the right to ask them to leave.\n"
