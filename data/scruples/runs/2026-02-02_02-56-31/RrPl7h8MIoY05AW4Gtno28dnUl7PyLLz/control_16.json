I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if keeping a log of payments to their parents and asking for them to sign is a bad idea.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is 21, paying $700 monthly to their parents for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They\u2019re worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and undermining trust.\n\nHmm. The parents are described as honest, but the person has a \"gut feeling\" they need to record the payments. Maybe they're concerned about their parents forgetting, miscounting, or there being a disagreement later. Or maybe they want a record to protect themselves in case of future issues.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to track payments isn't inherently wrong. It's a practical step, especially when dealing with money. But the concern is about how they approach it. If they present it as a necessary record to avoid misunderstandings, that's different from implying distrust. If they're upfront about their intentions, maybe it's respectful. But if they do it secretly, that could be seen as distrustful.\n\nThe question is whether the act of creating a log is wrong. Since the parents are offering the apartment, but the person is choosing a different room, maybe the arrangement isn't formal. Without a written agreement, there's a risk of disputes. So creating a log is a responsible action to prevent future conflicts. The key is how they communicate it. If they explain it's to maintain transparency and avoid misunderstandings, it's a good idea. The concern is about the method, not the intention.\n\nThe answer would likely be B, they're not in the wrong. They're taking a responsible step to ensure clarity. But the way they present it matters. The question is whether the action itself is wrong, not the manner. Since tracking payments is a reasonable precaution, the answer would be B.\n"
