I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and helping their parents financially by paying $700 each month. They want to keep a log of payments and have their parents sign it. They're worried about offending them, especially their mom, and think it might chip away at trust.\n\nFirst, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure out if keeping a log and asking for signatures is the right move.\n\nFrom what I know, in family situations, money can be sensitive. The user is trying to be responsible, which is good. They have a gut feeling to document payments, maybe to avoid future disputes. Their parents are honest, but maybe there's a past issue or just a cultural norm that makes the user cautious. \n\nOn one hand, documenting payments is a standard practice in any financial agreement to ensure clarity. It's not unusual to have receipts or records. On the other hand, in a family setting, it might be seen as creating distance or distrust. The user is concerned about offending their mother, so the approach matters here.\n\nThe user's intention is to be responsible, not to distrust. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, the method of implementation is key. If the user approaches it as a mutual agreement and explains the reasons, maybe the parents would understand. The user isn't trying to accuse but to create a clear record. \n\nBut if the parents take it as a lack of trust, then the user might be in the wrong in their approach. However, the user is trying to balance responsibility with family dynamics. The question is about whether the action itself is wrong, not the potential reaction. Since the user is acting in good faith to document and ensure accountability, which is a reasonable step, maybe B is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the parents feel the need for a formal agreement is unnecessary, then maybe the user's approach is wrong. But the user is trying to be responsible, so it's more about how they present it. The core issue is whether the action is inherently wrong, not the perception. So, if the user is acting in good faith, they aren't in the wrong. Hence, answer B.\n"
