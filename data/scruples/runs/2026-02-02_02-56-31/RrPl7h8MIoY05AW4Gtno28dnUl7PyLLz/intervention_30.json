I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to keep a signed log of payments. The question is whether they're in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are offering the upstairs apartment but the user prefers the lower floor. The user feels the need for a log because of financial instability and a gut feeling. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and possibly damaging trust.\n\nSo, why might they be in the wrong? If the parents have always handled money matters informally and the user's request for a formal log suggests distrust, that could be seen as disrespectful. Families often rely on mutual trust, and introducing a written agreement might be perceived as questioning their honesty. The parents' offer to let them stay in the house is an act of generosity, so structuring payments like a formal rent agreement might not align with that familial relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is being proactive about financial responsibility. Keeping a record could prevent misunderstandings or disputes in the future, especially if financial stress is high. It's a way to ensure both parties are clear on what's been paid. But the key is how to approach it without making the parents feel untrusted.\n\nThe user is concerned about being an asshole, so they want to maintain respect and trust. Maybe there's a middle ground, like a simple log without making it too formal. Explaining the purpose as a way to keep things clear and avoid future problems rather than implying distrust could help. But the original question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nSince the situation is between family members, the expectation is usually more on trust than legal formalities. The need for a signed log might indicate a lack of trust, which could be seen as the user's fault. Unless there's a history of financial issues or the parents have been unreliable, the user's action might be unnecessary and thus inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the user is creating a formal structure in a family matter that could undermine existing trust. They should communicate openly to explain their concerns without making it a contractual obligation.\n"
