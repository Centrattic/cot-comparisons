I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money owed. They want to keep a log with signatures. They're worried about offending their parents and possibly damaging trust.\n\nHmm, first, the user's intention is to be responsible. Keeping track of payments makes sense, especially if there's a financial arrangement. But they're concerned about how their parents might react. The parents are described as honest, so maybe the user is overcompensating by wanting a signed log. \n\nBut wait, in some cases, even with trust, having a written record can prevent misunderstandings. Maybe the user isn't in the wrong because they're trying to protect both sides. However, if the parents feel it's unnecessary, it could cause tension. The key is whether the user's request is reasonable and communicated respectfully. \n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting a log. The answer hinges on whether the action is seen as distrustful or just prudent. If the parents are okay with it, then no. But if it's done without explanation, it might come off as distrust. The user should approach it with transparency, explaining the reason for the log to maintain trust. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but the execution matters. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and the action is about protecting themselves responsibly, the answer is B.\n"
