I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. The scenario is about wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking for signatures.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and about damaging trust.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the approach. The person's reasoning is that it's a responsible move, but they're concerned about how it might be perceived. They want to maintain trust but also ensure there's a record. \n\nLegally, if there's a payment agreement, having a written log can be a good idea, especially if there's any possibility of disputes. But the social aspect is tricky. Parents might feel that the child doesn't trust them, which could hurt feelings. The question is whether the author's approach is wrong.\n\nThe original post is asking if keeping a log and asking for signatures is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the answer is B (no). The person isn't doing anything unethical or illegal. They're trying to be responsible and document the payments, which is a reasonable precaution. The concern about offending them is valid, but the action itself isn't wrong. How it's communicated matters, but the intent is to be responsible, not to distrust. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to do this. However, they should approach it carefully to avoid hurting feelings, maybe by explaining it's for their own records rather than implying distrust.\n"
