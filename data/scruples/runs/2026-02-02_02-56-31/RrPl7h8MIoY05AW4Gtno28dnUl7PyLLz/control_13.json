I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments to their parents. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and owed money. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their mom and think it might affect trust, but they feel it's responsible.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, wanting to document payments isn't inherently wrong. It's a common practice in financial agreements to have records to avoid misunderstandings. The parents are described as honest, but financial stress can cause issues. The author is trying to be responsible, which is a good thing. However, the concern is about how it might be perceived. The author is aware of the potential for offending, so maybe the issue is more about the approach rather than the act itself.\n\nIn many cases, adults handle money with documentation, even within families. It's about protecting both sides. The author isn't necessarily being distrustful but is being cautious. The question is whether this caution is justified. Since the author feels a \"gut feeling\" to document, it's reasonable. The problem would be if they were accusing without cause, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're taking a responsible step to manage finances, which is understandable, especially given the family's financial situation. The key is how they present it. If they approach it respectfully, explaining it's to avoid confusion and ensure everyone's on the same page, it's a valid action. There's no indication they're being disrespectful or distrustful without reason.\n"
