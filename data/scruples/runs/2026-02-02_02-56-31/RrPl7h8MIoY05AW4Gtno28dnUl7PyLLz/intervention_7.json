I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and have them sign it. They're 21, and their family is going through financial issues. They've agreed to pay $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to make sure they have a record, but they're worried it might offend their parents, especially their mom, and affect trust.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if their approach is wrong. The user is concerned about trust and honesty, but also about accountability. They want to be responsible. The parents are described as honest, so maybe the user is trying to protect themselves in case there's a misunderstanding later. \n\nIn many cases, when dealing with money, even within families, having a written record can be wise. It prevents disputes and clarifies expectations. However, the user is worried that this might seem like they're not trusting their parents. But is it really the wrong thing to do? If the parents are okay with the arrangement, having a log could be beneficial for everyone. It's more about protecting both sides. \n\nThe key points here are the user's intention to be responsible and the potential for the parents to feel offended. Maybe the user should communicate their reasons clearly, explaining that it's for everyone's benefit and not a lack of trust. If done respectfully, it's not wrong to want a record. So the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
