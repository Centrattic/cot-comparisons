I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments to their parents and get their parents' signatures. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is 21 and helping out their family financially because times are tough. They've agreed to pay $700 a month for rent and money owed. They want to create a payment log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried this might offend their parents, especially the mom, and feel like it could chip away at trust.\n\nHmm, the user's main concern is about trust and not being an asshole. They think their parents are honest, but they have a gut feeling to document payments. Why would they need that? Maybe they're worried about misunderstandings or keeping track for their own records. It's not about distrust, but about being responsible.\n\nIn family situations, money can be tricky. Even if the parents are trustworthy, the user might want a paper trail for their own peace of mind. They don't want to come off as accusatory. The question is whether documenting the payments is wrong.\n\nAnswer A says they're in the wrong, B says not. If the user is being responsible without suspicion, maybe B is correct. But if it's perceived as distrust, maybe A. However, since the user is proactive and wants to maintain trust, their intention isn't bad. The key is how they present it. If they explain it as a record for everyone, not to accuse, then it's reasonable. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
