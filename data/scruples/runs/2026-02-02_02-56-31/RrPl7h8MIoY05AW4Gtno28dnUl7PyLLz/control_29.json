I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and have them sign it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 each month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried this might offend their parents, especially the mother, and that it could damage trust.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to document these payments. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider family dynamics here. The parents are described as honest, but the child feels the need for documentation. Financial agreements, even within families, can be tricky. On one hand, the child is being responsible and ensuring accountability, which is a good practice. On the other hand, the parents might perceive this as a lack of trust, which could strain relationships. \n\nBut is the author wrong to want documentation? If the family is experiencing financial difficulties, having a clear record might actually prevent misunderstandings in the future. The key here is the approach. The author mentions that they're concerned about offending their parents, so they're aware of the sensitivity. They're asking for advice on how to do this respectfully, not just going ahead without considering their feelings.\n\nThe fact that the author is seeking a way to maintain trust while also being responsible suggests they're not in the wrong. They're trying to balance practicality with familial respect. Documenting payments isn't inherently wrong; it's a common practice in many relationships to avoid disputes. The main issue would be if the author were to implement this without communication, potentially causing hurt feelings. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong for considering it. Since they're looking for a respectful way to proceed, the answer is more likely \"No,\" the author is not in the wrong. They're taking a precautionary and responsible step, which is justified, especially given the financial context.\n"
