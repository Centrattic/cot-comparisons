They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments to their parents and have them sign it. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is 21 and paying $700 a month to their parents. The parents have given the upstairs apartment but the user prefers the lower floor. The user wants to document each payment with a log, including date, amount, and both signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mom, and feel like it could hurt trust, but they also think it's responsible. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the parents are described as honest, so maybe the user's concern is more about legal protection than distrust. The user might be thinking that even if the parents are trustworthy, there could be a misunderstanding or a dispute later. If they have a written record, that could prevent arguments. But the user is worried that creating this log might seem like they're not trusting their parents, which could be hurtful.\n\nOn one hand, it's responsible to have documentation when dealing with money, even within family. It's a way to keep things clear and prevent any future confusion. On the other hand, the user's parents might feel that the log is unnecessary and could take it as a lack of trust. The user's intention is to be responsible, but they need to approach it carefully to avoid offending the parents.\n\nSo, the user's actions are motivated by responsibility, not distrust. They want to ensure that both parties have a clear record. Since the parents are offering a room and the user is paying rent, it's a bit of a formal agreement. Having a log is a reasonable step to formalize it. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. The key is to present it as a way to keep things clear for everyone, not as a sign of distrust. They should communicate this when introducing the log to the parents.\n"
