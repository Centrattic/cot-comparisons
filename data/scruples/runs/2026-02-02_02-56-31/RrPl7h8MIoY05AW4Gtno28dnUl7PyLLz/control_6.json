I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the original question is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking them to sign it. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mom, and possibly damaging trust.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, wanting to document financial transactions isn't inherently wrong. Even within families, having records can prevent misunderstandings. The parents are described as honest, but maybe the author is just being cautious. The key here is whether the action is necessary and respectful.\n\nThe author is concerned about trust. They don't want to seem distrustful. However, creating a log with the parents' consent might actually show responsibility. If they approach it as a way to keep everyone on the same page rather than implying dishonesty, it might be okay. The question is if the author's approach is reasonable or if it's overstepping.\n\nAnother angle: family dynamics. Parents might feel that a formal agreement is unnecessary or that it's treating them like strangers. The author is trying to balance responsibility with family trust. Maybe the answer hinges on how the request is framed. If they explain it's for their own peace of mind and offer to let the parents sign for confirmation, it's more about transparency than distrust.\n\nBut does that make the author wrong? Probably not. The author is taking a proactive step to manage their finances, which is responsible. However, they need to communicate it carefully. The problem isn't the action itself but the potential perception. So the answer would be B (not wrong), as long as the author approaches it with the right intentions and communication.\n"
