I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the original question is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures to have a record.\n\nFirst, the parents are described as honest and great, but the user feels the need to document. The user is concerned that this might offend their mother, especially. They want to maintain trust but also feel responsible to have a record.\n\nHmm. The question is whether they're in the wrong. On one hand, the parents might feel that having a child document payments is distrustful. But on the other hand, the user is setting boundaries and taking responsibility for their finances. It's a gray area. \n\nIf the parents are honest and the user is just being cautious, maybe they're not wrong. But if the parents feel it's unnecessary, it could strain the relationship. However, the user is approaching it with the intention of being responsible, not accusing. The key is how they present it. If they explain it's for their own records and offer for the parents to sign, maybe it's reasonable. \n\nBut the user is worried about offending. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're being proactive and honest in their approach. They're not assuming the parents are dishonest but are creating a log for their own peace of mind. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
