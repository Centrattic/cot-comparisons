I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debt. They want to create a log of payments with signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mom, and possibly damaging trust.\n\nFirst, is there a wrong here? Well, the user is trying to be responsible by documenting the payments. If their parents are honest, they might not see the need. But the user's intuition is that there's a reason to keep a record. Maybe there's a history of financial issues or the user wants legal protection in case of disputes.\n\nIn family matters, especially with money, it's common for people to feel awkward about formalizing things. However, the user isn't doing anything illegal. They're just keeping a record, which is prudent. The key is how they approach it. If they present it as a way to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings, it's reasonable. But if they do it secretly or without explanation, it might seem distrustful.\n\nThe parents might feel the log implies they're not trustworthy. So the user needs to communicate that it's for everyone's benefit, not a lack of trust. If the parents refuse to sign, the user might have to proceed without their acknowledgment but still keep their own records. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Probably not. They're acting in their own interest to protect their financial record. The answer would be B (No). But they need to handle it sensitively to maintain family harmony.\n"
