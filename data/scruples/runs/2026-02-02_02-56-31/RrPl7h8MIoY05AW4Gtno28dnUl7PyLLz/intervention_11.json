I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and wants to log rent payments to their parents. They're worried about offending them but think it's responsible. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: family financial arrangement. The parents are offering an apartment but the user prefers a lower room. They agreed on $700 monthly. The user wants a log with signatures to keep track. The parents are described as honest, but the user feels it's necessary for accountability.\n\nPossible angles: Family dynamics vs. financial responsibility. The user's concern is about trust. They don't want to seem distrustful. But they also want a record, which is reasonable. Are they overstepping? Or are they being prudent?\n\nIn many cases, when family members have financial agreements, having a written record is actually a good practice. It can prevent misunderstandings and protect both parties. However, the way it's approached matters. If the parents might feel offended, the user should handle it carefully.\n\nThe user's intention is to be responsible, not to accuse. But asking for signatures might be seen as implying a lack of trust. The user is aware of this and is seeking advice on how to avoid being an asshole. So, the key is whether the action is justified despite potential feelings.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong: If the user's actions are motivated by a need for accountability and they're transparent about it, they're not wrong. However, if the method of implementation is likely to cause offense without a clear reason, maybe. But given the financial situation and the desire to be responsible, the user is in the right to want a record. So answer B, No.\n"
