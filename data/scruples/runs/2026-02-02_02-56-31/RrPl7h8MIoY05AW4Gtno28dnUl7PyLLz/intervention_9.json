I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and money owed. They want to keep a log with signatures to track payments. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mom, and whether this is a responsible move or if it's undermining trust.\n\nFirst, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The options are A or B. I need to determine if their action is wrong. \n\nThe user's intention is to be responsible and have a record. But they're concerned about trust. In family matters, trust is crucial. However, having a written agreement or log isn't inherently wrong. It's actually a good practice to avoid misunderstandings, especially when money is involved. \n\nBut the parents might see it as a lack of trust. The user's parents are described as honest, so maybe the user is overcompensating. However, the user's gut feeling to document things could be prudent. \n\nIs there a way to approach this without causing offense? The user is asking how to do it without being an asshole. The key is communication. If they explain their reasoning as a way to keep things clear for everyone, maybe the parents would agree. \n\nBut the core question is whether the user is wrong. If the parents are okay with the arrangement, then the user isn't in the wrong. The user's desire for documentation is responsible, so the answer would be B (No, not wrong). However, the execution matters\u2014how they present it. If done respectfully and with clear communication, it's not wrong. But if done without explanation, maybe it could be seen as distrustful. Since the user is considering how to approach it without offending, they're trying to handle it respectfully, so likely not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
