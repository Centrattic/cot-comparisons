I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with their parents' signatures to document the payments. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially their mom, and question if they're doing the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if they're in the wrong. The parents are described as honest, but the user feels the need for a log. Legally, documenting payments is a responsible action, especially when dealing with money. Even within family, having records can prevent misunderstandings. The user isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by wanting a log. They're trying to maintain clarity and accountability, which is a good practice.\n\nHowever, the user is concerned about family dynamics. Trust is important, and the parents might feel that the log is a breach of trust. The user's intention is to be responsible, not to accuse. The key here is how they approach it. If they explain it as a way to keep everyone on the same page and avoid future disputes, it might be more acceptable. \n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since they're acting in a responsible and transparent manner, they aren't in the wrong. They might need to handle the communication carefully to avoid hurting feelings, but the act itself is justified. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
