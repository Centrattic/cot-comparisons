I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking them to sign.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and owed money. They want a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mom, and question if it's undermining trust.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The parents are described as honest and great, but the person feels the need for a log. They mention a \"gut feeling\" about recording payments. The key points here are the reason for the log and the method of implementation.\n\nThe author's intention is to be responsible. They're not demanding a contract but just a simple log with signatures. The problem is whether this action is inappropriate. Since it's a personal matter between family members, and the author is an adult, establishing a record might be seen as prudent. However, family dynamics can be sensitive. The concern is about trusting the parents, but the author is also trying to protect themselves.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything unethical. They're seeking to document an agreement, which is common in financial transactions. The issue might be the perception. If the parents feel it's distrustful, that could cause tension. But the author's approach is to be responsible, not to accuse. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're taking a responsible step, which isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be in how they approach it, but the act itself is justifiable.\n"
