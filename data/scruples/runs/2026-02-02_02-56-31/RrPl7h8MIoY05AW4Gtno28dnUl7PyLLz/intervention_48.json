I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments to their parents and have them sign it. They're 21, and there's some financial strain in the family. They agreed to pay $700 monthly, but they want to document it to avoid issues.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether they're wrong to do this. The options are A) Yes, they're wrong, or B) No, they're not. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is an adult now, and they're setting up a financial arrangement with their parents. It's common for adults to formalize agreements, especially when money is involved. The user's motivation is to be responsible and ensure clarity, which is reasonable. \n\nBut they're worried about offending their parents. Their parents are described as honest, but maybe there's a cultural or family norm that makes this seem unusual. The user is trying to balance trust with practicality. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether documenting the payments is necessary and respectful. Since the user is paying rent, which is a financial transaction, keeping a record is a standard practice. It's not about distrust but about having proof in case of discrepancies. \n\nHowever, the way they approach it matters. If they frame it as being responsible rather than distrustful, it's less likely to be seen as offensive. The key is communication. If they explain their reasoning calmly and show that it's for everyone's benefit, the parents might appreciate the transparency. \n\nSo, am they in the wrong? Probably not. They're taking a proactive step to manage their finances responsibly. The answer should be B. They're not in the wrong. The main thing is how they present it. If they handle it with care, it's a reasonable action.\n"
