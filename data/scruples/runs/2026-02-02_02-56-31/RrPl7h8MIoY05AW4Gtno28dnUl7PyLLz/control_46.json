I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the original question is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking them to sign. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and owed money. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mom, and question if it's a trust issue.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the parents are described as honest, but the child feels the need to track the payments. The key points here are about responsibility versus trust. The person is trying to be responsible by documenting the transactions, which is a practical approach to avoid misunderstandings. However, the parents might see it as a lack of trust, which could strain the family relationship.\n\nIn many cases, when there's a financial agreement within a family, some form of documentation is actually a good idea. It can prevent disputes and clarify expectations. The fact that the person is being careful and wants to avoid offending them suggests they're trying to balance both responsibility and respect. \n\nThe question is whether their intention is wrong. Since the parents are in a financial crisis, the child is helping out, and the log is for their own peace of mind, it's not inherently wrong. The problem might be how they approach it. If they explain it as a way to be responsible rather than implying distrust, it could be better received. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a responsible step to ensure clarity and avoid future conflicts. The main issue is the method of communication, not the act itself.\n"
