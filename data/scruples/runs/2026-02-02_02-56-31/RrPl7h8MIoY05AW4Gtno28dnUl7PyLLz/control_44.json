I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person in the original post (OP) is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and have them sign it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The OP is 21, living with their parents who are currently facing financial difficulties. They've agreed to pay $700 monthly for rent and other debts. The parents offered the upstairs apartment, but the OP prefers the lower floor. The OP wants to create a log of payments with dates, amounts, and signatures from both parties. They're worried this might offend their parents, especially their mother, and question if it's undermining trust.\n\nNow, the core issue is whether the OP is being reasonable or overstepping. The parents are described as honest and great, but the OP has a \"gut feeling\" they should track payments. The question is if the OP is wrong for wanting to do this.\n\nPossible angles to consider: family dynamics, financial agreements, trust. In a family setting, especially with parents, there's often an unspoken understanding that might not require formal documentation. However, when money is involved, even within families, it can lead to misunderstandings or disputes if not properly recorded. The OP is trying to be responsible, which is understandable given the amount involved.\n\nBut would asking for a signed log be seen as distrust? The parents might take it as a lack of faith in their honesty, which could strain the relationship. On the other hand, the OP is trying to protect themselves from potential issues, maybe future disputes about whether payments were made. \n\nFinancial experts often recommend documenting any financial transactions, even between family members, to avoid confusion. However, how it's approached matters. If the OP explains their reasoning as being responsible and not a lack of trust, maybe the parents would understand. The key here is the OP's intent versus the parents' perception.\n\nIs the OP in the wrong? If they are genuinely concerned about record-keeping and want a mutual agreement, perhaps not. But the way they approach it could affect the parents' feelings. The answer might depend on cultural context or family norms. In some families, such documentation is normal; in others, it might be seen as cold or distrustful.\n\nThe question is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), it's because they're taking a responsible step to track their financial obligations. If A (in the wrong), it's because this action might be seen as undermining family trust without necessity. But since the OP is trying to be responsible and the parents are honest, maybe the OP isn't wrong. However, the potential for offense is there, so the approach needs to be handled carefully.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to document payments, as it's a responsible action to ensure clarity. However, the manner in which they present it to their parents is crucial to avoid hurting their feelings. So the answer is B.\n"
