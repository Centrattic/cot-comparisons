I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about keeping a log of payments to their parents and asking for signatures. The person is 21, and there's some financial arrangement where they pay $700 each month. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures, but they're worried it might offend their parents or damage trust.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down. The author is trying to be responsible by documenting payments. Their parents are honest, but the author feels the need for a log. Is there any wrong in wanting to keep track? Well, family dynamics are important here. The parents might see the log as distrust, even if the author's intention is good. But the author isn't doing anything harmful yet; they're just thinking about how to approach it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do this.\n\nOn one hand, documenting payments is a responsible action, especially if there's a financial arrangement. It's not illegal or unethical. On the other hand, the way they approach it could affect family relationships. The key point is the intention. The author isn't accusing their parents of anything; they just want a record. The problem is potential offense, but the author is considering how to do it without being an asshole. So they're being cautious, which suggests they're not in the wrong for wanting the log. It's about protecting everyone's interests. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author isn't doing anything wrong by wanting to document the payments responsibly.\n"
