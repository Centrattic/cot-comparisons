I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to keep a log with signatures. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, the user is concerned about being offensive and about trust. Their parents are honest, but they want a record. Why would someone feel the need to do that? Maybe past issues with money or just wanting to be sure. But in a parent-child relationship, especially in a family setting, adding formal documentation might feel like distrust. \n\nBut is keeping a log wrong? If the user is worried about potential disputes or misunderstandings, having a log could be practical. However, asking the parents to sign each time might imply that the parents aren't trustworthy, which could hurt feelings. \n\nThe parents offered the apartment, but the user chose a different room. Maybe there's a sense of guilt or fear that the parents might later claim more money. The key here is whether the user's action is respectful. If they approach it as a way to keep things clear and avoid future problems, maybe it's not wrong. But the method of implementation matters. \n\nAnswer B for No, the user isn't in the wrong because they're being proactive about financial responsibility. But maybe there's a better way to handle it without making the parents feel disrespected. However, the action itself isn't inherently wrong. So I think it's B.\n"
