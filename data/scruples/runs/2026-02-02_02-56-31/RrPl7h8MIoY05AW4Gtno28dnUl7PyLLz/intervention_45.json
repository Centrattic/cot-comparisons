I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money owed. They want to create a log of payments with signatures to keep track, but they're worried it might offend their parents, especially their mom. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The user is trying to be responsible by documenting the payments. Their parents are going through financial difficulties, so maybe there's some stress there. The user wants to ensure that the payments are recorded in case of any disputes or misunderstandings. That makes sense from their perspective.\n\nBut they're also concerned about trust and honesty. They don't want to come off as distrustful. However, creating a log isn't necessarily about distrust. It's more about having a clear record. The key here is how they approach it. If they explain it as a way to be responsible and avoid confusion, it might help. \n\nThe parents offered the upstairs apartment, but the user prefers the lower floor. That might be a side point, but maybe the arrangement is a bit informal. A log could formalize it, which isn't a bad thing. \n\nThe user's intention is to be responsible, not to accuse anyone. So, is asking for a log a wrong move? Probably not. The answer is likely B (they're not in the wrong). The main thing is how they present it. If they're open and honest about their reasons, it's a reasonable step to take. They might need to be gentle in their approach to avoid making the parents feel distrusted, but the act itself is justified.\n"
