I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents and affecting trust.\n\nHmm. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need for a record. Is that wrong? Well, the author is trying to be responsible. Maybe they're worried about misunderstandings. Like if there's a dispute later, having a log would help. But family dynamics can be tricky. \n\nSome might say that between family, trust should be enough, and keeping a log could seem like a lack of trust. But on the other hand, the author is handling money and wants to ensure clarity. Financial agreements, even within family, can lead to issues if not properly documented. \n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong for wanting this. The parents offered the apartment, but the author chose a different room. The payment arrangement is agreed upon. The log would just formalize it. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They're being proactive to avoid future conflicts. However, how they approach it matters. If they explain it's for clarity and not distrust, it might help. So the answer is B.\n"
