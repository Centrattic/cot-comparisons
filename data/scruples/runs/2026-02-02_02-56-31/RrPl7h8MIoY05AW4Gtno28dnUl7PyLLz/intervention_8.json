I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month. They want to keep a log with signatures. The parents are honest, but there's a concern about trust and offending them.\n\nHmm. The user is trying to be responsible by documenting payments. But maybe they're worried that their parents might forget or there could be a dispute later. The parents offered the upstairs apartment but the user prefers the lower floor. So the arrangement isn't formalized beyond the verbal agreement.\n\nThe key here is whether keeping a log is necessary and respectful. If there's a potential for misunderstanding or financial issues, having a written record is actually a good practice. It's not about distrust but about clarity. However, the user is worried about coming off as suspicious. \n\nBut the parents are described as honest. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong. They're just being proactive. The answer should be B, No, they aren't in the wrong. The way to approach it is to explain it's for everyone's clarity, not a lack of trust.\n"
