I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to keep a log with their parents' signatures. They're worried about offending them, especially since their parents are described as honest. The question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is an adult, so there's a boundary between parent and adult child. They're setting up a formal agreement, which might feel odd in a family context. Parents might see it as distrust, even if the user is being responsible. But the user's reasoning is about responsibility and documentation, which makes sense, especially if there are financial issues.\n\nPossible angles: Is documenting payments necessary? In some cases, yes, to avoid disputes. But in a family, it could be seen as lacking trust. However, the user is trying to be fair and responsible. Maybe the parents would appreciate the transparency once explained. The key is the approach. If the user explains their reasoning without blaming, maybe they can get the parents on board. Alternatively, maybe a less formal approach, like keeping receipts, would suffice. But the user specifically wants a log with signatures, which adds a formal element. That might be necessary if there's a history of confusion or disputes. The user isn't wrong for wanting to protect themselves, especially if there's financial strain. So, the answer is probably B, not in the wrong. They're trying to be responsible and clear. The challenge is how to present it without offending, but they're not wrong for wanting to do it. They just need to handle it sensitively.\n"
