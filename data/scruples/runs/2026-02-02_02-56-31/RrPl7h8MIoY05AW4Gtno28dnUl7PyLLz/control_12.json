I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and helping their parents financially by paying $700 a month. They want to keep a log of payments and get signatures. The question is whether they're wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, the parents are in a tough financial spot. The user is helping them out, which is good. But wanting a record of the payments might be about trust. The parents are described as honest, but the user feels a need to document it. Maybe they're worried about misunderstandings or future disputes. \n\nDoes keeping a log imply they don't trust their parents? It could be seen that way, especially if the parents are already offering the apartment and the money is meant to help them. The user is concerned about offending the mother, which suggests they value the relationship. \n\nHowever, from a practical standpoint, documenting financial transactions is common and smart. It's not about mistrust but about having proof in case of any confusion. The user is trying to be responsible. The key is how they approach it. If they explain it as a way to keep everyone organized and avoid conflicts, maybe the parents would understand. \n\nSo, is the user wrong? If they approach it respectfully, explaining the reason, then no. They're not being inconsiderate if they're trying to maintain clarity. The main issue would be if they framed it as distrust. But since they're trying to be respectful and avoid being an asshole, their intentions are good. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
