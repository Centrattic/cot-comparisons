I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month.

I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. The parents are described as honest, but the person feels they need to track payments to avoid issues, maybe because of financial instability in the family.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking for a signed log. The key points here are about trust and the potential for causing offense. The author is trying to be responsible, but there's a concern about hurting feelings, especially the mother's. \n\nFirst, the author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical per se. They\u2019re just tracking payments, which is a reasonable step in financial agreements. However, the context is within family, not a typical landlord-tenant relationship. In a family setting, formalizing things like this can sometimes be seen as creating distance or mistrust. The parents might feel that the child doesn't trust them, even if that's not the intent. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid reason to document payments, given the financial situation. It's a way to ensure clarity and avoid future disputes. The author is trying to maintain responsibility and accountability. But how it's approached matters a lot. If done in a way that's respectful and explains the reasons without implying distrust, maybe the parents would understand. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is acting in good faith and their intention is to be responsible, then they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the way they approach it causes unnecessary offense or damage to family trust, there could be a problem. But the act of keeping a log itself isn't inherently wrong. The author is trying to protect both sides, really. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), because the author's intentions are good, and they're acting responsibly. The potential issue is about how they communicate it, not the action itself.\n"
