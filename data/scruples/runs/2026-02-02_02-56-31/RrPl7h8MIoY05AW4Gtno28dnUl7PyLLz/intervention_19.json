I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to keep a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. The parents are described as honest, but the user feels the need to document payments. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and if they're being responsible or overstepping.\n\nSo the question is whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the user's reasoning: they want to be responsible by recording payments. They're in a financial arrangement with their parents, and documentation can prevent misunderstandings. Even if parents are honest, having a written record is practical, especially if there's a history of financial issues. The user isn't implying distrust but is setting clear terms. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might see it as a lack of trust. Family dynamics can be sensitive. The user is trying to avoid being an asshole by being upfront. They\u2019re asking how to approach it without causing offense. \n\nSince the user is seeking a way to document without offense, maybe the answer is that they're not in the wrong. They\u2019re being proactive and responsible. Unless the parents have already agreed to a certain method of payment, documenting isn't wrong. It's about protecting both parties. So answer B (No).\n"
