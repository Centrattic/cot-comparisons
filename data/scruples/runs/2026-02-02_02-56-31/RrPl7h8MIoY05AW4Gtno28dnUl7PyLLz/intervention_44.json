I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is 21 and paying $700 a month to their parents for rent and money they owe. They want to create a log with signatures to track the payments. The question is whether they're in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The user is in a semi-formal agreement with their parents. They want to document payments to avoid any future disputes. The parents are described as honest, but the user is concerned about offending them, especially the mother. The user is worried that this log might seem like a lack of trust.\n\nSo, the options are A (you're wrong) or B (you're not). Let me think. The user's action is about ensuring clarity and accountability. Even if the parents are honest, having a record is a responsible step. However, there's a cultural or family dynamic aspect here. In some families, documenting such things might be seen as distrustful. But from a legal/financial perspective, keeping a record is prudent, especially if there's any chance of future disagreements.\n\nThe user isn't making the parents sign under duress; they're just asking for a log. The key here is the intention. The user is trying to be responsible, not to accuse. So, they're not in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves. However, how they approach it might matter. They need to frame it as a way to ensure everyone is on the same page rather than implying distrust.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because documenting transactions is a standard practice for clarity and trust in the long run. The user's concern is valid, but the method should be sensitive to family dynamics. The answer should affirm that they're right to take this step, but also suggest a tactful approach to avoid offending the parents.\n"
