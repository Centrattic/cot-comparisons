I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and has agreed to pay their parents $700 a month. They want to keep a log with signatures. The parents are honest, but the user feels they should record payments.\n\nHmm. The user is worried about offending their parents, especially the mom. They're trying to be responsible but concerned about trust. So, the question is whether they're in the wrong (A or B). \n\nFirst, why would they be in the wrong? Maybe because it's a family matter and they're treating it like a formal agreement. Parents might see it as a lack of trust. On the other hand, the user is being responsible and wants a clear record. \n\nIf the parents agreed to the arrangement, the user isn't doing anything unethical. But the method could be seen as creating distance. However, if they approach it as a mutual agreement for clarity, maybe it's okay. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong). They're trying to manage a financial arrangement responsibly. The key is how they present it. If they explain it's for everyone's benefit and not a distrust, it's okay. So, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
