I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and making monthly payments to their parents. They want to create a log with signatures for each payment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting this log.\n\nFirst, the parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need to track payments. This could be about trust, but the author acknowledges it might offend their mom. They want to be responsible but worried about trust.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key is whether creating a log is reasonable. Since there's an agreement in place, documenting payments isn't inherently wrong. It's a way to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings. The parents might not expect it, but the author's intention is to be responsible, not to distrust. The answer would be B, because the author is acting in a responsible manner without necessarily being wrong. They're just formalizing an agreement, which is common in financial transactions. The concern about offending the parents is valid, but that doesn't make the action wrong. The author should approach it sensitively, maybe explain it's to keep everyone on the same page, not to question their honesty.\n"
