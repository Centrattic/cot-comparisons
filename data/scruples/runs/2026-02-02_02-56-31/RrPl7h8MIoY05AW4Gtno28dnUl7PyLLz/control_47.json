I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments to their parents and having them sign it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 21, paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and other debts. They want a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need to document payments. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is being reasonable or overstepping. The parents are giving a room for free but the author prefers a different one. They want to formalize payments with a log. \n\nPossible angles to consider: trust, formality, cultural norms, and potential offense. The author mentions that their mother might be offended and that it could chip away at trust. However, the author feels it's responsible.\n\nIn some cases, even with trust, having documentation can prevent disputes. If the financial situation is rough, keeping records is prudent. However, imposing a formal log might come off as distrustful. The key is how the author approaches it. If they explain it as responsible management rather than distrust, it might be better received.\n\nAlso, the age difference and living situation matter. At 21, the author might be seen as adult but still part of a family. Formalizing payments could be necessary for their own records, especially if there's any chance of future issues.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Probably not. They're trying to be responsible, but the method might need a sensitive approach. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but they should handle it carefully to avoid offending their parents.\n"
