I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to keep a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. The parents are honest, but the person feels the need to document this. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is setting up a financial agreement with their parents. Even though it's within the family, documenting payments can be a good practice to avoid misunderstandings. However, there's a concern about offending their mom and affecting trust.\n\nIs there any wrongdoing here? The person isn't doing anything illegal. They're trying to be responsible. The problem might be more about family dynamics than right or wrong. The parents might see it as a lack of trust, but the person is just being cautious. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to keep a record. The answer should be B.\n"
