I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money owed. They want to keep a log with signatures. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the parents are described as honest, but the user feels the need to track payments. Maybe they're worried about misunderstandings or financial issues. They want to avoid offending the parents, especially the mom. The user is concerned about trust.\n\nIf the parents agreed to the arrangement, then a log might help both sides. It's a way to ensure clarity and avoid disputes. But asking for signatures could be seen as distrust. However, the user is trying to be responsible. \n\nAm I in the wrong? Well, if the parents agreed to the payments, wanting a record isn't inherently wrong. It's about protecting both parties. The key is how it's approached. If done respectfully, maybe the parents would understand. So the answer is B, No.\n"
