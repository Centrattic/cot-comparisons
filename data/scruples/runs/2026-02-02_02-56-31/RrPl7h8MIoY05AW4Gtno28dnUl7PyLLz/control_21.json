      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" post) is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 21, paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried this might offend their parents, especially the mom, and question if it's undermining trust.\n\nSo, why would the author be in the wrong? Well, if the family has an informal agreement and the author is introducing a formal structure, that could be seen as distrustful. Parents might feel the child doesn't trust them, which could harm family relationships. But then again, maybe the author is just being cautious. \n\nOn the flip side, the author mentions the family is going through financial rough times. Maybe the author is trying to protect themselves from potential misunderstandings or disputes later. If there's no prior agreement in writing, documenting payments might be a responsible move. Especially if there's any possibility of confusion about what's been paid. \n\nThe key factors here are trust and communication. If the parents are honest and trustworthy, the author's actions might come off as unnecessary and distrustful. However, if the author has a legitimate reason to document (maybe past issues, or to avoid future conflicts), it's a bit more justified. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether documenting payments is reasonable or if it's an overstep. Since the author's intention is to be responsible and not to accuse their parents of wrongdoing, it's more about personal caution. However, approaching it without discussing first might be the issue. The right approach would involve talking to the parents first to explain the reason and get their consent, which the author is considering. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're trying to be responsible. They might just need to handle it more sensitively. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
