I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to keep a log with signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents or seem like they don't trust them.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the user is in the wrong. The options are A or B. The key points here are trust, responsibility, and how to approach this without causing offense.\n\nThe user's intention is to be responsible and document payments. That makes sense, especially if there's a financial arrangement between family members. However, family dynamics can be sensitive. The parents are described as honest, but the user feels a need to document it. \n\nIs there a wrong here? If the user communicates clearly and respectfully, it's about managing their own peace of mind and ensuring clarity. They might be overthinking it, but the act of documenting isn't inherently wrong. The problem would be if they don't talk to their parents about it first and present it in a way that feels accusatory. \n\nIf they approach it as a way to keep things clear for everyone and not as a distrust, it's more about being proactive. So the answer would likely be B, they're not in the wrong. They need to handle the communication carefully, but the action itself is reasonable.\n"
