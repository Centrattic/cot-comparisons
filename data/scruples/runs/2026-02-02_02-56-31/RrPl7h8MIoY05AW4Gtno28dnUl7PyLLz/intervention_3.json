I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 21, living with their parents, and paying them $700 a month. They want to keep a log of payments with their parents' signatures. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user is in a situation where they're contributing financially to their parents. The parents have given them an apartment, but the user prefers another room. The user feels the need to log payments, possibly to ensure transparency or protect themselves legally. \n\nThe parents are described as honest, but financial issues have come up. The user is worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, by creating a log that requires signatures. They see it as responsible but also a possible breach of trust.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, even between family members, having a written record can be prudent. It's common in landlord-tenant situations, even within families, to have documentation. However, the user is concerned about how this might affect family dynamics. \n\nTrust is important in family relationships. The parents might feel that signing a log implies distrust. The user's intention is to be responsible, but the method might be perceived as accusatory. \n\nThe key here is whether the user's action is reasonable given the circumstances. The user is trying to protect themselves financially, which is understandable, especially if there have been past issues. However, the approach of requiring signatures might not be the best way to maintain trust. \n\nAlternative solutions could include discussing the concern with the parents first, explaining the need for a record without making it a formal agreement that requires signatures. Maybe a simple shared document where both parties can note payments without the formality of a signature each time. \n\nIn summary, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to keep a log, but the method (requiring signatures) might be causing the issue. The right approach would be to communicate the intent to maintain transparency without undermining trust. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong), but the execution needs to be handled sensitively.\n"
