I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to keep a log and have both parties sign it. The parents are described as honest, but the user feels they need a record. The user is worried about offending them, especially the mom, and possibly damaging trust.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). So, I need to decide if keeping a log and asking for signatures is wrong.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that it's responsible, but they're concerned about offending. From a practical standpoint, creating a written agreement can be a good idea, even within families. It clarifies expectations and prevents misunderstandings. However, the emotional aspect is important here. The user's parents might feel that this creates a sense of distrust. \n\nIn family situations, maintaining harmony is crucial. While the user isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by keeping a log, the way they approach it could affect family dynamics. The key here is the user's intention. They want to be responsible but are aware it might be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nIf the user is transparent about their reasons and presents the log as a way to ensure everyone is on the same page rather than implying distrust, it might be better received. The user isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves financially, but they need to be sensitive in their approach. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the user isn't in the wrong) because their intention is to maintain accountability and responsibility, which is valid. However, they should consider the family's feelings and communicate their reasons clearly to avoid misunderstandings.\n"
