I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and living with their parents, paying them $700 a month as rent or to pay off debt. They want to keep a log of these payments and have it signed by the parents. The question is whether they're in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are struggling financially, and the user is helping out. The user is setting up a structured payment plan. Keeping a log with dates, amounts, and signatures seems like a reasonable way to document the transactions. But the user is worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and possibly affecting trust.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, in terms of legality, documenting financial transactions isn't wrong. It's actually a good practice, especially when dealing with family. It can prevent misunderstandings and serve as a record in case of disputes. The parents might be offended if they feel the user doesn't trust them, but the user's intention is to be responsible, not to question their parents' honesty.\n\nThe user is trying to maintain trust by being transparent. Maybe the parents might feel that the log is unnecessary or that it's treating family like a business arrangement. However, the user's approach is to create a record without being confrontational. The key here is the user's approach. If they present it as a way to ensure clarity and avoid future misunderstandings, it might be more acceptable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong) because the user is acting responsibly and the log is a practical tool. The potential for offense is real, but the user isn't at fault for wanting to document agreements. The issue might be more about how to communicate this to their parents gently.\n"
