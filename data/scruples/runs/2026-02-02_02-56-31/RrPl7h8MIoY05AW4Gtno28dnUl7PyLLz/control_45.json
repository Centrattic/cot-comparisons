I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments and have their parents sign it. The person is 21, paying $700 monthly to their parents. They feel they should record payments due to a gut feeling, but they're worried about offending their parents and affecting trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is an adult child paying their parents, which can be a delicate situation. The parents are offering an apartment but the person prefers another room. The main issue is the desire to document payments, which is about financial responsibility. But the user is concerned about potential offense.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the person isn't doing anything illegal. Documenting payments is a common practice in financial transactions to avoid misunderstandings. However, family dynamics play a role here. Trust is important, and asking for a signed log might be perceived as distrust, even if the intention is to be responsible. \n\nBut the user is aware of this and is trying to approach it carefully. They want to maintain trust while being responsible. The key here is whether the action itself is wrong. Since there's no indication that the parents are dishonest, the person might be overstepping by formalizing something that's typically informal in family settings. However, if there's a financial arrangement, documenting it isn't inherently wrong. It's more about how it's communicated.\n\nThe answer might be that the person isn't in the wrong because they're being proactive about their finances, but they need to handle the situation sensitively to avoid hurting family relations. So the answer would be B for No.\n"
