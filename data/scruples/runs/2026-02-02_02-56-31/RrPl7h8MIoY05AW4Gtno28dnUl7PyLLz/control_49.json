I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether keeping a log of payments to their parents is appropriate.\n\nFirst, the author is 21 and has agreed to pay their parents $700 monthly for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts paid, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and feel it might affect the trust.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about financial responsibility versus family dynamics. The author wants to ensure that payments are recorded, which seems reasonable for accountability. But they're concerned about trust and possible offense.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to document payments isn't inherently wrong. It's a way to keep things clear, especially if there's a financial agreement. The parents might feel mistrusted, but the author is being proactive. However, the approach might need to be considerate. Maybe discussing it first with the parents to explain the reason for the log would help. The author isn't doing it to accuse but to be responsible. So, I don't think they're in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
