I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month. They want to keep a log of these payments and have the parents sign it. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mom. The main question is whether they're in the wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, the user is trying to document the payments. Why would that be a problem? Well, families often have informal agreements, and adding paper trails might seem like a lack of trust. But on the other hand, the user is being responsible and ensuring there's a record, which could prevent misunderstandings. If there's a financial disagreement later, having a log would help.\n\nThe parents are described as honest, so maybe the user is overthinking. But maybe the user's parents aren't used to such formal arrangements, so introducing a signed log could be seen as distrustful. The user also mentions feeling a gut instinct to record payments, which might stem from past issues or anxiety about money.\n\nIs the user being an asshole? They want to maintain trust but also want accountability. The key is how they approach it. If they frame it as a way to keep things clear and responsible, maybe it's not wrong. But if they present it as suspicion, that could be a problem.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they're being proactive. But the way they communicate it matters. The user isn't wrong for wanting to document, but they need to handle it carefully to avoid hurting feelings. The main point is that documenting financial agreements is reasonable, especially when money is involved, to prevent future conflicts. The user isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect both sides.\n"
