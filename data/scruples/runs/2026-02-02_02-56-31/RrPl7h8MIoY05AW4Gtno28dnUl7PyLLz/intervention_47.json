I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and some owed money. They want to keep a log with their parents' signatures. They're worried about offending their mom, especially since the parents are described as honest.\n\nFirst, is there a problem with keeping a log? Well, it's a financial arrangement between family. Even though they're family, having a record isn't inherently wrong. It's responsible, actually. But the concern is about trust and how it might be perceived.\n\nThe parents are offering a space but the user prefers the lower floor. Maybe that's just a detail but shows the setup. The user's motivation is to be responsible, but the parents might see it as a lack of trust. That could strain the relationship. However, the user isn't trying to accuse the parents of anything; they just want a record for themselves.\n\nIn family situations, especially with money, things can get sensitive. The user's approach should consider the parents' feelings. Maybe starting with a conversation, explaining it's to keep things clear and avoid misunderstandings, rather than implying distrust. Using a simple log and asking for a signature is a neutral action, but the perception matters.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Probably not. They're trying to be responsible. The issue is how to present it without offending. The answer is B\u2014no, they aren't in the wrong. The key is the method of communication.\n"
