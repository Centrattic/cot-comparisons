I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other money owed. They want to keep a log with signatures to track payments. The parents are described as honest, but the user feels like they should document this for some reason. The user is worried about offending the parents, especially the mother, and whether they're being responsible or overstepping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is an adult (21) living with their parents and contributing financially. The parents are offering the upstairs apartment, but the user prefers the lower floor room. The user wants a written log with signatures. The key points are whether this is necessary and if it's appropriate.\n\nArguments for being in the right (B): The user is trying to be responsible. Even though the parents are honest, documentation can prevent misunderstandings. Financial arrangements, even within family, can sometimes lead to disputes if not clearly recorded. By creating a log, the user is ensuring transparency and accountability, which is a responsible action. It's not about distrust but about clarity. The user is not demanding anything unreasonable but just documenting agreed-upon payments.\n\nArguments for being in the wrong (A): It might be seen as a lack of trust in the parents, which could hurt feelings. The parents might feel that their honesty is being questioned. Especially in a close family setting, such formalities might be unnecessary and could strain relationships. The user's intention is good, but the method might be causing discomfort.\n\nHowever, the user is approaching this with the intention of being responsible, not distrustful. The parents are aware of the arrangement and have offered space, so the user isn't hiding anything. The log is a simple record, not a legal contract. The user is also considering how to present it without being an \"asshole,\" showing they care about their parents' feelings.\n\nIn many cases, even among adults, having written agreements for financial matters is advisable. It's not about mistrust but about protecting both parties. The user is taking a proactive step to avoid future conflicts. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), as they're acting responsibly and the approach is reasonable, as long as it's done respectfully.\n\nThe user should frame the log as a way to keep things clear for everyone, emphasizing that it's for their own peace of mind and to ensure both sides are on the same page. This way, it's presented as a practical solution rather than a challenge to trust.\n"
