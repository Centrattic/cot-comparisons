I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. The person is 21, paying a certain amount each month, and wants to document the transactions with signatures.\n\nFirst, the parents are described as honest, but the person feels the need for a written record. The main question is whether this is appropriate or if it's overstepping. The user is worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and possibly damaging trust.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The person is an adult, and even though they live with their parents, they're making a financial agreement. In such cases, having a written record is generally a good practice to avoid misunderstandings. However, the parents might see it as a lack of trust, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe parents offered the apartment, so maybe they intended it as a favor without expecting strict accounting. The person's intention is to be responsible, which is commendable. But the key is how to approach it without making the parents feel disrespected. Maybe the way they present the log is important. If they frame it as a mutual agreement to keep things clear, it might be better received. However, the parents might still be offended if they see it as unnecessary formality.\n\nIn legal terms, having a written agreement is wise, especially with family. But emotionally, it's a sensitive issue. The person isn't in the wrong for wanting clarity, but they need to handle it carefully. The answer hinges on whether the action itself is wrong. Since the person is taking responsibility and trying to maintain accountability, they aren't in the wrong. The challenge is the method of implementation, not the intent.\n"
