I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments to their parents. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, helping their family financially by paying $700 a month. They want a written log with dates, amounts, and signatures from both sides. The parents are described as honest, but the author is worried about offending them, especially the mother. They feel responsible but also concerned about trust.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to document payments isn't necessarily wrong. Even among family, having a record can prevent misunderstandings. The author is trying to be responsible, which is a good thing. But they're also considering the parents' feelings, which shows they care about the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might see it as a lack of trust. However, the author isn't accusing them of anything; they just want a mutual agreement in writing. The key here is that the author is asking the parents to sign, which implies mutual consent. If the parents agree, then it's a valid arrangement. If they don't, the author might need to adjust their approach.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to balance responsibility with maintaining family trust. Since their intention is to create a clear record and they're seeking the parents' agreement, they aren't being unreasonable. The parents' potential offense would depend on how it's presented. The author is being cautious, which is appropriate. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
