I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. They're 21 and paying $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to have a log with dates, amounts, and both signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mom, and question if it's a responsible move or if it's undermining trust.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key here is to determine whether their actions are justified. \n\nThe parents are described as honest, but the user has a gut feeling to document payments. That suggests they're not necessarily distrusting their parents but want a paper trail for their own peace of mind. Financial transactions between family members can get complicated, especially when money is involved. Even if the parents are trustworthy, having a record could prevent misunderstandings later. \n\nThe user is concerned about offending their mother. Maybe they're worried it comes off as not trusting them. But since they're paying rent, it's a business-like transaction, and documentation is standard practice. They're not accusing anyone of wrongdoing, just wanting to keep track. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, is the user wrong for wanting to protect themselves financially? Probably not. It's a responsible action to ensure both parties are on the same page. The issue is how to present it without causing offense. The user is trying to find a way to do this respectfully. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, they're not in the wrong). It's a proactive step to maintain clarity and trust, and as long as they approach it with transparency and respect, it's a valid decision.\n"
