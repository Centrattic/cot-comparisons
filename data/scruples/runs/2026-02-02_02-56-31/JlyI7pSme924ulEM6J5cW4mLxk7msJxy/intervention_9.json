I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a new mom who's getting a lot of deliveries. She's been putting up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" because she probably doesn't want the delivery person to knock when leaving packages. She mentions that the handwritten signs were ignored, so she got a more visible sign with company logos, which worked. But then, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person just left it at the door, and it was ice cold. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. As a new mom, she might be dealing with a lot, maybe with a baby or young child, so she doesn't want the delivery person to knock and disturb or cause a mess. She tried multiple times to communicate her preference through notes and signs, which shows she made an effort. However, the delivery person still knocked before. Then the new sign worked, but the outcome was the food being left at the door and getting cold.\n\nThe key point here is that she wanted no knocking for packages, which is understandable. But when it comes to food delivery, especially hot food, the expectation might be different. Leaving it at the door without waiting could lead to it cooling down, which is an issue. The delivery person followed her instruction literally (no knocking) but didn't use common sense to check if the situation required a different approach, like waiting a bit or finding another way to inform her.\n\nThe user's husband says they were asking for it, implying that by not knocking, they're responsible if the food is left there. But the user argues that common sense should have been used. The question is whether she's wrong for expecting the delivery person to follow the sign strictly. \n\nOn one hand, she communicated her preference clearly, and the delivery person followed it. On the other hand, food delivery typically requires confirmation that the food is received, which might not be possible if the person doesn't knock. So maybe the sign was too absolute in a situation where nuance was needed. \n\nBut she's a new mom, so her needs are valid. However, maybe the sign didn't differentiate between package and food deliveries. The solution might be to have a more specific sign for packages, not for food. So, in this case, the delivery person followed the instruction, but the outcome was unintended. The user might not be in the wrong because she tried to communicate her needs, but she could have considered different instructions for different types of deliveries. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment and not left the food unattended. But if the sign said \"Do not knock,\" then the delivery person isn't at fault for following the instruction. So, maybe the user is at least partially responsible for not considering that the sign might affect food deliveries differently. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area, but since she communicated her preference and the delivery person followed it, the main issue is that the user didn't account for different delivery types. Therefore, she might share some responsibility, but not entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B (No) because she's not entirely at fault, but there's some nuance.\n"
