I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of packages and deliveries. She's had issues with delivery people knocking despite her clear instructions to the contrary. She made signs saying \"Do not Knock\" with the courier logos, which worked for packages but caused a problem when a food delivery was left outside in the cold.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. She's been consistent with her requests, but the food delivery person followed the same rules as package couriers. The food got left outside and was cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have been applied.\n\nFirst, her instructions were clear and consistent. She used signs and notes in checkouts. The sign with courier logos worked for packages, so the food delivery person probably followed the same rule. However, food delivery is different from packages. Packages can wait and are usually left safely, but food needs to be delivered hot or kept warm. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction without considering the nature of the delivery. \n\nBut the user's request was specific: \"Do not knock\" for packages. Food isn't a package, so maybe the instruction was too general. The delivery person might not have realized that the rule applies only to packages. However, the sign didn't specify that. The user's problem is that the delivery person didn't knock when they should have, leading to a cold meal.\n\nIs she in the wrong? She set the instruction, but perhaps the sign was too broad. The delivery person followed the instruction to the letter but didn't use common sense. However, the user's main issue was with packages, not food. The husband's point is that by having the sign, they were asking for the delivery to be left. But the user expected common sense. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. She had a legitimate reason to not want knocking, but food delivery requires different handling. The sign's wording wasn't specific enough. So maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but the sign's ambiguity played a role. The delivery person also should have used judgment. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she didn't specify that the rule applies only to packages, but the sign included courier logos that might have been specific to package services, it's possible she's not in the wrong. But the answer might depend on how specific her instructions were. Since the sign didn't differentiate between package and food deliveries, maybe she's at least partially responsible. But the delivery person also didn't use common sense. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because her instructions were clear, even if the sign's scope was too broad, but she can't be blamed for expecting the delivery person to knock when it's food. Alternatively, she might be in the wrong for not specifying exceptions. Hmm. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the delivery person followed the instructions, but she didn't make a clear exception for food. However, the delivery person should have used common sense. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since her instructions were clear and consistent, but the outcome was unintended, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
