I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a new mom who's had issues with delivery drivers knocking on her door, which she's tried to address with signs and notes. She created a sign that worked for packages but caused a problem with food delivery. The delivery person left the food at the door, which got cold. The husband thinks they're asking for it, but she feels common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. As a new mom, she might have valid reasons for not wanting strangers knocking on the door, maybe to avoid disturbances or safety concerns. She took steps to communicate her preference, which is reasonable. The sign was effective for packages, so she might not have anticipated the issue with food delivery.\n\nHowever, the delivery person might not have been aware that the sign applied to food deliveries as well. The sign had corporate logos, so maybe it was meant for package couriers. Food delivery services might not have seen the sign, or the driver might not have read it carefully. The user probably didn't intend to exclude food deliveries, but the sign didn't specify. \n\nThe key here is whether her actions were reasonable. She tried multiple times to communicate \"do not knock,\" which is about packages. The sign was effective for that purpose. When using the same sign for food, maybe the drivers assumed it was for packages only. The user might not be in the wrong because her intent was clear for packages, and the food delivery issue was an unintended consequence. However, she could be seen as not considering that food might need to be delivered differently. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person should use common sense. If the food is hot, leaving it at the door could ruin it. But the sign said \"Do not knock,\" so the driver followed instructions literally. The user expects drivers to use judgment, but maybe the sign didn't account for that. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? The answer depends on whether her sign was too broad or if she should have made exceptions. Since she intended the sign for packages and the food delivery was an oversight, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
