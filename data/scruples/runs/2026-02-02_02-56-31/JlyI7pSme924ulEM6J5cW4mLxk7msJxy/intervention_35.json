I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who receives a lot of packages. She's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite her clear instructions to not knock. She put up signs and wrote notes in delivery options, but they were ignored. Then she found a new sign with corporate logos that worked for packages but caused a problem with food delivery. The food was left outside and got cold because the delivery person didn't knock. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, her intention was to prevent knocking for packages, which she successfully did with the sign. The problem arose when the same sign applied to a food delivery. The delivery person, following the sign's instructions, left the food outside, leading to it being cold. The user's husband thinks they asked for it, but she believes common sense should have prevailed.\n\nThe key points here are clear communication and the context of the delivery. She specified \"Do not knock\" for packages, but food delivery might require different handling. The delivery person might not differentiate between package signs and food orders, especially if the sign is generic. However, the sign's presence led to unintended consequences. \n\nOn one hand, the user set clear rules, and the delivery person followed them literally. On the other, expecting the delivery person to use judgment in a different context (food vs. packages) might be reasonable. The user might be at fault for not considering that food deliveries need a different approach. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense to knock even if the sign said not to, especially when delivering perishable items.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the sign's instructions were too broad. If the sign was meant only for packages, maybe the user should have clarified. But since the delivery person followed it strictly, the user might share some responsibility. However, given the context of a new mom needing to avoid disturbances, her intent was understandable. The delivery person's strict adherence without considering the situation's urgency could also be a factor. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the user not being entirely in the wrong because her intention was clear, even if the sign's application led to an unintended outcome.\n"
