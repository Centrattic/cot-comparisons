I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a new mom with a lot of packages delivered. She had signs saying not to knock, but the delivery people kept knocking. So she put up a sign with the courier logos saying \"Do not knock\" and it worked. Then she ordered dinner, and the delivery person didn't knock, left it at the door which got cold. She's upset because the food was cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent the delivery people from knocking, which they did successfully. But when it came to food delivery, the same instruction led to an issue. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which the author put up, so they didn't knock. But the author wanted the food to be delivered properly, expecting them to knock here too.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's sign was effective in stopping knocks for packages, but she expected different behavior for food. Maybe the sign was too broad? The sign didn't differentiate between packages and food. The delivery person followed the instruction literally, leading to an unintended consequence. \n\nWas the author wrong? She tried to solve a problem she had with packages, but the solution caused an issue with food. She might have not considered that food delivery might require a different handling. Her husband's comment suggests that maybe she was overextending the rule. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person might not have known that the no-knock policy was only for packages. The sign didn't specify. The author might be at fault for not making the instructions clear enough. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense to realize that food needs to be handed over, not left at the door. \n\nBut the author's sign was explicit, so the delivery person followed it. The problem arises from the author's own instructions. If she didn't want the food left at the door, she should have specified that the no-knock rule was only for packages. Since she didn't, maybe she's in the wrong for not clarifying. \n\nBut wait, maybe common sense should have prevailed. The delivery person could have knocked even if the sign said not to, realizing that food is time-sensitive. However, the sign might have been a corporate instruction, so maybe the delivery person was bound to follow it. \n\nHmm. The author's sign was about not knocking, which works for packages but not for food. She might be in the wrong because she didn't adjust her sign to account for food deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person could have used judgment. But the sign was her own doing. \n\nI think the answer is that she's not in the wrong. The delivery person followed her instructions, but the instructions were too general. The problem is that the sign didn't specify exceptions for food. However, she had a valid reason for not wanting knocks (as a new mom, maybe to avoid disturbing the baby). The delivery person's action was technically following the sign, but the result was unintended. The blame might lie with the delivery person for not using discretion, but since they followed the sign's instruction, maybe the author is not in the wrong. She might need to adjust her sign, but in this situation, she's not the asshole.\n"
