I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this situation step by step. The user is a new mom who's had a lot of package deliveries. She's been using signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" to avoid the noise, especially around her baby. But the delivery people kept ignoring those instructions. So she made a more visible sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but not for a food delivery. The food was left at the door and got cold because the delivery person didn't knock. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. She wanted to avoid knocking for packages, so she created a sign. The sign was effective for packages but not for food. The food delivery person left it outside, leading to a cold meal. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks they should've used common sense.\n\nFrom a perspective of responsibility: She made the sign to communicate her preference. But the sign might have been misinterpreted. Maybe the delivery person saw the sign and thought that since it was a food delivery (not a package), they didn't need to knock. Or maybe the sign was too specific to packages. The key here is whether her sign was clear enough. If the sign only mentioned packages, then the food delivery person might not have realized it applied to them. But the user included the courier logos, which might have made the sign applicable to all deliveries, not just packages. \n\nThe delivery person's job is to ensure the food is delivered correctly, which usually requires knocking to hand it over. Leaving food at the door, especially if it's cold, could be a mistake. However, the user's sign might have contributed to the delivery person's decision not to knock. \n\nOn the other hand, the user had a valid reason to avoid knocking for packages to protect her baby. But food delivery is different because it's perishable and often needs to be handed directly. Maybe the user should have made a separate sign for food deliveries, or clarified that the sign doesn't apply to food. \n\nHer husband's perspective is that they were \"asking for it,\" which suggests that by having the sign, they should have expected this outcome. But the user's intention was to prevent knocking for packages, not for food. There's a nuance here between packages and food. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The delivery person might have been following the sign's instructions too literally, but the user might not have considered that food delivery requires a different approach. The sign's effectiveness for packages was successful, but it might have been too broad. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user might share some blame for not clarifying that the sign doesn't apply to food deliveries. However, the delivery person also didn't use common sense, as food is usually delivered in person. The user's intention was to avoid noise, which is understandable as a new parent. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. The sign might not have been specific enough. But the delivery person's action led to a cold meal, which is a problem. The user's husband is right that the sign could lead to this scenario, but the user's situation as a new mom is valid. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the user isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication. However, the delivery person also shares some responsibility. Since the question is whether the user is the asshole, and given the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
