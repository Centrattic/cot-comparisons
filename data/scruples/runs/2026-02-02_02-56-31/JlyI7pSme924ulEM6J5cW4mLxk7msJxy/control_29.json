I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she probably didn't want the door to be knocked during deliveries, maybe because of the baby. She tried different ways to communicate this but it didn't work until she used a sign with the courier logos, which made people leave the packages without knocking.\n\nThen, when they ordered dinner, the delivery was late. The delivery person saw the sign, didn't knock, and just left the food at the door. It got cold, and now the author is upset. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo the question is, is she at fault? Let's break it down. The key points are the intent of the sign, the delivery person's action, and the consequences. The signs were meant to prevent knocking, which they did successfully. But the delivery person left the food at the door, which the author didn't expect or want because it led to the food being cold.\n\nWas the sign's message clear? The sign says \"Do not knock,\" which is straightforward. But maybe the delivery person assumed that if they can't knock, they should leave the food outside even if the customer isn't there to take it immediately. However, the problem here is that the sign might have been misinterpreted. The delivery person might have thought that not knocking meant to leave it at the door, but the author expected them to wait for her to answer the door. But wait, how would they know she's waiting? The sign says not to knock, so maybe the delivery person thought they couldn't knock to notify her. So, if the author wants the delivery person to wait until she opens the door, but the sign says not to knock, the delivery person can't signal her to come answer. So maybe there was a miscommunication. The sign might be too literal. Maybe the author should have specified that they can leave it at the door without knocking, but she wanted to avoid that. But the problem is that she didn't provide an alternative instruction. She just said not to knock, which might have led the delivery person to leave it outside. The author's expectation was that the delivery person would wait for her to open the door without knocking. But how would the delivery person know she's ready? The sign prevented the usual communication method (knocking), so the delivery person had to make an assumption. Maybe the delivery person thought that since knocking is prohibited, the customer will come to the door when they can, but the food can't wait, so they left it outside. The result is that the food was left there and got cold. The author's husband thinks they were asking for it because the sign's message was clear, and they should have anticipated that. But the author's point is that the delivery person should have used common sense, like maybe calling or finding another way to communicate. However, delivery people might not have the time or ability to call each customer, especially if the platform doesn't support that. So maybe the author's sign was too ambiguous. The problem is that the instruction to not knock might not have considered the alternative action the delivery person should take. If the author wanted the food to be kept warm, maybe she should have specified that the delivery person should wait until the customer is ready, but that would require a way to communicate. Since the sign didn't include that instruction, the delivery person followed the explicit instruction (no knocking) but didn't account for the implicit need to keep the food warm. So maybe the author is at fault for not providing clear instructions. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used better judgment. The answer depends on whether the sign's message was clear enough. If the sign only says \"do not knock,\" it's possible that the delivery person didn't realize the customer wanted to be present for the delivery, just that knocking wasn't allowed. So the author might have been in the wrong for not making it clear that the delivery should wait until the customer is there to receive it, beyond just not knocking. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the instructions given were insufficient and led to the unintended consequence.\n"
