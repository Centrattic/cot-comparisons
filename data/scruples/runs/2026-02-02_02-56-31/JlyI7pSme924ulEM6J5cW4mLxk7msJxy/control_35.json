I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who has packages delivered a lot and was concerned about people knocking on the door, maybe because she's busy with a baby and doesn't want interruptions. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" and tried to communicate that in delivery notes, but no one listened. Then she found a sign with corporate logos, which worked in preventing knocks, but when a food delivery came, they left the food at the door, and it got cold.\n\nThe author is upset about the food being cold, and her husband says they were asking for it. She's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which she had a valid reason for, especially as a new mom dealing with a lot. She tried multiple ways to communicate this, but the previous attempts didn't work until the sign with logos worked. However, the consequence was that the food delivery person didn't knock, leading to the food being left at the door and getting cold. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author is responsible for the delivery person's actions. The sign was effective in stopping knocks, but maybe the delivery person should have exercised common sense. For example, even if there's a sign not to knock, if delivering food, it might be reasonable to knock to ensure the recipient is there to take it immediately. However, the delivery person might not have considered that, possibly due to following the sign's instruction strictly.\n\nThe author's actions were to prevent knocking for packages, which she had a right to do. The problem arises when the sign's instructions were applied to a different context (food delivery instead of packages), leading to unintended consequences. The author might not be in the wrong because her primary intent was to manage package deliveries, and the food delivery situation was an unforeseen consequence. However, she could have adjusted the sign to specify only packages, but maybe she didn't think of that. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person might have made a mistake by not knocking and leaving the food out, especially since food requires timely handling. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that using the sign might have led to this outcome. But the author's intention was not to cause issues with food delivery; it was an unintended side effect.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't directly at fault for the delivery person's actions. The delivery person should have used judgment to knock for food, even with the sign present. The author's sign was about packages, so maybe the delivery person over-applied the rule. However, the author could have been more specific in her sign. Still, considering the context, the main issue is the delivery person's failure to use common sense, not the author's sign. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
