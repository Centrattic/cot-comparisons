I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a new mom who's had problems with delivery people knocking on her door even though she put up signs saying \"Do not Knock.\" She tried multiple times to communicate this through notes and the delivery options, but it didn't work. Then she made a sign with the courier logos, which worked in preventing them from knocking, but now the food delivery person didn't knock and left the food at the door, which was ice cold when they realized.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On her side, she's a new mom, which can be a stressful time, and having deliveries knocked on the door might be disruptive or inconvenient. She made every effort to communicate her preference, but it wasn't respected. The sign with the logos was effective in stopping the knocking, but in this case, the delivery person didn't knock when they shouldn't have, leading to the food being left outside and getting cold. \n\nFrom the delivery person's perspective, maybe they followed the sign's instruction not to knock, so they left it at the door. The user might have expected the delivery person to use common sense, like delivering food in a timely and safe manner, but the sign didn't account for that. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that the sign might have been too literal, not considering the need for the delivery person to knock for food.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the sign should have specified \"Do not knock for packages only\" or included exceptions. The user's intention was to prevent unnecessary knocks, but food delivery is different. The problem is that the sign was too broad, leading to unintended consequences. \n\nSo, the user might not be in the wrong entirely because her intention was clear, but the sign's wording or design didn't account for different types of deliveries. However, she could have been more specific. The delivery person followed the sign but didn't use judgment for the food delivery. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user tried to communicate her needs, but the sign's effectiveness was too absolute. Therefore, she might be partially at fault for not considering different delivery types. However, the delivery person should also use common sense when delivering food. \n\nThe key point is whether the sign was clear enough. If the sign didn't differentiate between packages and food, then the delivery person followed the instruction literally. But maybe the user should have made it clear that food deliveries require knocking. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the sign was ambiguous, then she might share some responsibility. But given the context of being a new mom and the repeated issues, her frustration is understandable. The answer might be B (No), but there's room for both perspectives. However, the fact that she didn't specify exceptions in the sign might mean she's not entirely wrong. The delivery person's job is to ensure the delivery is done properly, so they should have knocked for food. But the sign told them not to knock. So, it's a bit of a conflict. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), as the user's intention was to prevent unnecessary knocks, and the delivery person followed the sign. However, the user could improve the sign's clarity. But given the scenario, she's not in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock when delivering food, even if the sign didn't specify. The delivery person should use judgment, so the fault isn't entirely hers.\n"
