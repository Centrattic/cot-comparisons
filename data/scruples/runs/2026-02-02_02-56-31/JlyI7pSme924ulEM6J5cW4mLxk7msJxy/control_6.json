I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent package deliverers from making noise, which she found annoying. She kept getting packages left at the door without knocking. Then she put up a sign with courier logos and the same message, which worked for packages but when a food delivery person followed it, the food was left outside and got cold.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. The key points to consider are the intent behind the sign, the expectations of the delivery person, and the consequences. The author wanted to stop people from knocking, so she put the sign up. However, food deliveries are time-sensitive and require more care. The delivery person might have assumed that since the sign was there, they could leave the food unattended, which isn't standard practice for meals. \n\nThe author clearly communicated her preference, but maybe didn't consider that food delivery is different from packages. Packages can be left outside, but food needs to be kept warm and sometimes requires confirmation that someone is home. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instructions literally, leading to the cold food. However, the author's signs were specific to packages, and the food delivery person could have interpreted it differently. \n\nThe husband's comment suggests that the sign was too broad. The author's signs said \"Do not Knock\" without specifying which delivery types, so the food deliverer might have followed it. The author's expectation was that only package deliverers would follow the sign, not food. But the deliverer might not have known the difference, especially if the sign was general. \n\nCommon sense is a factor here. It's reasonable to not want to be knocked on, especially for a new mom. But expecting food to be left outside regardless of the temperature might not be reasonable. The delivery person might have had to use discretion, but if the sign was clear, maybe the author overgeneralized.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's sign was too ambiguous. If the sign didn't specify that food deliveries should still have someone present or handled differently, the delivery person might have acted rightly based on the instruction. However, the author's mistake was not considering the different handling needs for food. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not clarifying the sign's scope. Alternatively, the delivery person should have checked the food's condition. I think the sign's ambiguity is the issue, so the author shares some responsibility. Answer A.\n"
