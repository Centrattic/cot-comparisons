I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door even though she put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and included it in delivery notes. She ended up using a sign with courier logos which worked, but now a food delivery person left the dinner outside in the cold because they didn't knock. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, her intention was to prevent knocking, which she did through signs and notes. The problem is that the sign might have been too broad, causing delivery people to leave items outside even when a knock would have been appropriate, like for food that needs to be delivered hot. \n\nShe's not in the wrong for trying to prevent unwanted knocks, especially as a new mom who might need quiet. But the sign might not have been specific enough. Maybe she should have differentiated between package deliveries and food delivery. The delivery person followed the sign, but in this case, it led to a negative outcome. \n\nHer husband said they were asking for it, but she argues that common sense should have prevailed. However, the delivery person might not have been able to make a judgment call if the instructions were clear. So, maybe there's a balance here. She did her part to communicate her preferences, but perhaps the sign's design was too absolute without exceptions. \n\nThe food being left cold is an issue, but the delivery person followed the instructions given. So, the problem here is that the instructions were not nuanced. She might need to adjust the sign to specify that food deliveries require knocking, while packages don't. That way, the instructions are clear and exceptions are made for different delivery types.\n\nIn conclusion, she's not entirely in the wrong because she communicated her preferences, but the sign's lack of specificity led to the problem. Maybe a B (Not in the wrong) because the intention was valid, but the execution could be improved.\n"
