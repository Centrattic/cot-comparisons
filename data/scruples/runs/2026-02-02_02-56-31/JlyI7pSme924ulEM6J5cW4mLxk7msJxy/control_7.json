I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for expecting the food deliverer to knock. They are a new mom with lots of packages, so they put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because they didn't want the package left at the door. But the delivery people kept knocking, so they made a sign with the corporate logos, which worked for packages but not for the food delivery. The food was left at the door, got cold, and now they're upset.\n\nHmm. So the author's intention was to prevent packages from being left at the door, which they achieved with the sign. However, when it came to dinner, the delivery person followed the sign's instruction and left it without knocking. The problem here is that the author expected the sign to only apply to packages, not food deliveries. But the sign didn't differentiate between the two. The delivery person probably followed the instructions as written, assuming the same rule applied to all deliveries. \n\nThe author wrote \"Do not knock\" in various places, but maybe the sign's wording or design was too broad. They might have been unclear that the instruction was only for packages, not for food. The delivery person did what was asked, so technically, they followed the instruction. The author is upset because the food got cold, but the delivery person can't be blamed for following the given directions. The author might be at fault for not specifying that the sign applies only to packages and not to food deliveries. So, the answer could be A, yes, they're in the wrong because they didn't clarify the context of the sign. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense to knock for food, but the sign said not to. It's a bit of a tricky situation. Maybe the author is partly at fault for not being clear.\n"
