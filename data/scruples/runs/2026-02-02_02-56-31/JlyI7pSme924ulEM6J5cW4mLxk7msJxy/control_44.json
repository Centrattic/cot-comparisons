I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person not to knock. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She's had issues with delivery people not following her \"Do not Knock\" instructions, so she put up signs. The signs worked initially, but then when she ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door, even though the sign said not to knock. The food was cold, and she's upset about that. Her husband says they're asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nSo, the key points here are the signs she put up. Initially, they were handwritten with \"Do not Knock\" but were ignored. Then she used signs with corporate logos, which worked for packages but not for the food delivery. The problem is whether her signs were clear enough for the food delivery person to understand that they shouldn't knock for food.\n\nWait, the sign she used had the corporate logos, implying it might be specific to package deliveries. Maybe the sign didn't cover food deliveries. If the sign was only about packages, then the delivery person might not have realized it applied to food. So, the author expected the sign to apply to all deliveries, but maybe it's ambiguous. The delivery person might not know if the sign includes food.\n\nIn that case, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't clearly specify that the sign applies to all deliveries, including food. Her instructions were for packages, and the food delivery person might have assumed it was a different situation. Also, leaving food at the door isn't safe if there's a dog or something, but in this case, the issue was the cold food and the knock not happening. However, the main issue is about the knock. She wanted no knocking for packages, but food delivery might require a different approach. Maybe she should have specified in the delivery note for the food order that she wanted no knock. But she didn't, so the delivery person followed the general rule but not the specific needs of food delivery.\n\nAlternatively, the delivery person might not have read the sign properly or assumed it was only for packages. The author might not be in the wrong if the sign was intended to apply to all deliveries, but if the sign's instructions were unclear, then it's a communication issue. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that by using the sign, they set an expectation that might not be practical for all types of deliveries. But the author might argue that common sense would have the delivery person check if the sign applies to their specific delivery.\n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the sign was about packages and not food, the delivery person might have reasonably assumed it didn't apply to food. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not clarifying that the sign includes all deliveries. But if the sign was meant to apply to all deliveries, then maybe the delivery person should have known. However, the key is that the sign wasn't specific enough. The answer might hinge on whether the sign's instructions were clear. Since the author had previous issues with packages being left at the door despite the \"Do not Knock\" signs, but then the food delivery person followed the sign and left it at the door, causing the problem, the author might be in the wrong for not realizing that the sign could lead to unintended consequences for food deliveries. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
