I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock on their door. The situation is that she's a new mom with a lot of packages, so she put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent disturbance. But when she later wanted someone to knock (maybe for food delivery?), the delivery person didn't knock and left the food at the door, which got cold.\n\nWait, so she had signs up saying not to knock for packages, which worked. But the problem came when they ordered dinner. She probably didn't want the package left at the door then, right? But the delivery person followed the existing signs and didn't knock. The husband says they asked for it, implying that the sign was clear. The author is upset that the delivery person didn't use common sense to realize it's dinner and not a package.\n\nSo the key points are: she had clear instructions to not knock for packages, but maybe didn't specify that food deliveries should knock. The delivery person followed the signs literally. The question is whether she's wrong for expecting them to knock in this case. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, maybe she should have made separate instructions for different types of deliveries. But she was trying to prevent noise for packages. The problem is that the sign was ambiguous\u2014maybe the delivery person didn't realize the difference between a package and a food order. So she might share some responsibility for not clarifying the sign. But the delivery person could also be expected to exercise some judgment. \n\nIf the sign was specific to packages, then the author might be in the wrong for not differentiating. But if the sign was too broad, then maybe the delivery person should have used common sense. However, the husband's comment that they asked for it suggests that the sign was followed correctly. So the author's confusion is because she expected the delivery person to know the context, which might be unreasonable. \n\nIn that case, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because she didn't clearly differentiate between package and food deliveries, leading to the mishap. But maybe the delivery person should have known better. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, given that the sign was clear and the delivery person followed it, the author's expectation might be unreasonable. So AITA would likely say the author is the asshole here.\n"
