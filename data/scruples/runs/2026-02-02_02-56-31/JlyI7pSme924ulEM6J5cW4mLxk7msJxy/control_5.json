I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She's been using signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" to prevent delivery people from knocking, maybe because she's busy with the baby and doesn't want the interruption. But the delivery people kept knocking despite her instructions. Then she put up a more prominent sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left it outside. The food was cold, and now she's upset. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations from both sides. The author wanted to avoid being knocked on the door, so she took steps to communicate that. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction and didn't knock, which led to the food being left outside and getting cold. The key here is whether the delivery person should have used their judgment despite the sign. \n\nFood delivery is different from packages because food is time-sensitive and needs to be delivered while still hot. So maybe the delivery person should have realized that the \"do not knock\" instruction doesn't apply here. The author might be at fault for not making an exception for food deliveries, but the delivery person might also be at fault for strictly following the sign without considering the context. However, the delivery person might not be able to know if it's food unless the note specified. The author's signs were for packages, but she might not have made it clear that food deliveries are different. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? By putting up the sign, she's setting expectations for all deliveries, not just packages. The delivery person followed the instruction but didn't account for the perishable nature of food. The author might have been wrong in not differentiating between package and food delivery instructions. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense, but maybe the sign was too explicit. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nConsidering that the sign worked for packages but not for food, perhaps the author didn't consider that different types of deliveries require different handling. Her husband's point about asking for it might have some merit because she didn't specify exceptions. On the other hand, the delivery person should have known better, but maybe they couldn't. The answer hinges on whether her instructions were too broad and if she should have anticipated the need for exceptions. I think the author might share some responsibility here because she didn't account for different delivery scenarios. So the answer could be A (yes, she's in the wrong). But maybe B (no) if the delivery person should have used judgment regardless. It's tricky. I'm leaning towards A because she didn't adjust her instructions for food deliveries, leading to the problem.\n"
