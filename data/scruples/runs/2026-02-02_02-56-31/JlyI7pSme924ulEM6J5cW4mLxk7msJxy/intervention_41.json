I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite clear instructions not to. They used signs and notes, but it wasn't effective until they put up a specific sign with courier logos that worked. However, the last delivery person followed the sign by leaving the food at the door, which ended up being too late and the food was cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the user feels common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to stop the knocking, which was causing issues, possibly disturbing a baby. Using the sign with logos was effective, but the delivery person took it too literally. The problem here is that the sign didn't specify to wait or contact them if the door is closed. The user might be in the wrong if the sign wasn't clear enough, but the delivery person could also be at fault for not using judgment. However, the user's main issue was to prevent knocking, which they achieved with the sign. The food being cold is an unintended consequence. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to follow the instructions they provided, but maybe the sign should have included more specific instructions beyond just \"no knock.\" So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The user's sign was effective in stopping knocks, but the delivery person didn't adapt, which is part of their job. The user's responsibility is to communicate clearly, which they did, so it's not their fault.\n"
