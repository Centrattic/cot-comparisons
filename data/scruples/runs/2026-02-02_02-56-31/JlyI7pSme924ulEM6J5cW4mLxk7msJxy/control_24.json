I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock. The situation involves a new mom who had a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, which was ignored. Then she changed to a sign with company logos, which worked until the food delivery person left it at the door, resulting in cold food.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to have packages left at the door without knocking. They tried various methods to communicate this, including written notes and delivery options. However, when the food delivery person followed the sign by not knocking, it led to a problem because the food was supposed to be handed over to the recipient. \n\nThe key here is that the sign was intended for package deliveries, which are typically left at the door. Food delivery, on the other hand, usually requires the recipient to be present to receive the food, often while it's still hot. By using a sign that applies to packages, the author might not have considered that food deliveries are a different service. The delivery person followed the instruction literally, leading to the food being left outside and getting cold. \n\nThe author expected the delivery person to use common sense, but the sign didn't specify different treatment for food versus packages. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that the sign's placement or content might have been ambiguous or not specific enough. \n\nIn this case, the author might be in the wrong for not clarifying that the sign applies only to packages and not to food deliveries, which have different handling requirements. The delivery person followed the given instructions without additional context, which was a valid action based on the sign's presence. Therefore, the author's expectation that the delivery person should have known to knock despite the sign might be unreasonable. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
