I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who's trying to manage deliveries. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want the delivery people to knock, maybe to avoid disturbing her baby or because she's busy. She tried multiple times to communicate this via notes on packages and in checkout instructions, but it didn't work. Then she put up a sign with courier logos, which worked for packages, but then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, leading to a cold meal.\n\nSo the question is: is she the asshole for expecting the food deliverer to knock? Her husband says they're asking for it, but she thinks common sense should apply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent here. The signs were initially for packages, not food. The delivery person might not have realized that the sign applies to food deliveries as well. The sign uses courier logos, which might include food delivery services. The person might have assumed that the same rule applies to all deliveries, including food. But maybe the sign wasn't clear enough to specify that it's only for packages. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, hence left the food at the door, but the cold meal is a problem.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? She tried to communicate her preferences multiple times, but the food delivery person didn't consider that food needs to be handled differently. On the other hand, she might have been too broad with the sign, not specifying that it's only for packages. But she did mention the corporate logos, which might cover all their services. However, expecting a delivery person to use common sense that packages and food are different might be reasonable. The delivery person should know that food is perishable and needs to be handed over quickly, not left outside. So maybe the fault isn't entirely hers. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks they should have considered the sign's impact on food. But the author's reasoning is that common sense should prevail, which is a valid point. The delivery person should have knocked despite the sign because food is different. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the answer depends on whose responsibility it is: the customer's clear communication versus the delivery person's judgment. If the sign was ambiguous, she might share some blame. But if it was clear, maybe the delivery person is at fault. The sign included food couriers, so she might have expected that. However, the sign said \"Do not knock\" without exceptions. So she might be at fault for not making an exception for food. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used their judgment. This is a bit tricky. The answer would depend on whether the sign was unambiguous. If the sign only applied to packages, but the delivery person applied it to food, then the person is wrong. But if the sign was clear and the delivery person followed it, the author's sign might be too rigid. Hmm. I think the key point here is that the sign was intended for packages, but the delivery person extended it to food without checking. The author didn't specify exceptions, so maybe she's partially at fault. However, expecting that food delivery requires a different handling might be reasonable. So maybe the answer is B, she isn't in the wrong because the delivery person should have used common sense despite the sign.\n"
