I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for expecting food deliverers to knock. They're a new mom with lots of packages, so they made signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent the door from being slammed open, maybe? But those signs were ignored by package deliverers. Then they got a sign with specific courier logos, which worked for packages but not for food delivery. The food was left outside and got cold. The husband says they were asking for it. The user is upset because they expected the delivery person to use common sense and not leave the food outside when the sign was for packages, not food deliveries.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the intent of the sign. The user wanted packages to be left at the door without knocking, but when a food delivery person saw the same sign, they left it outside. The user expected the food delivery person to knock, but the sign said \"Do not knock,\" which was meant for packages. Maybe the sign was too generic or the delivery person misread it. The user is frustrated because the food was left cold, but the sign didn't specify that food deliveries should knock. \n\nSo, the user's mistake might be using a sign intended for packages for all deliveries, including food. The delivery person might have assumed that since the sign said \"Do not knock,\" the food should also be left at the door. The user didn't clarify that the sign was only for packages, leading to confusion. That could make them partially at fault. However, the sign had specific courier logos for attention, maybe implying it's for their services. But the sign didn't mention food, so the deliverer might not have known there was a difference. The user's intention was to stop people from knocking, but the sign's wording might have been too broad. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person could have used common sense and knocked despite the sign, especially since food is perishable. The user expects that even with a \"Do not knock\" sign, food needs to be handled carefully. So maybe the delivery person is at fault for not using common sense. But the sign might have led them to leave it outside. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The user's sign might not be clear enough, but the delivery person could have acted differently. However, the user's main point is that they expected food delivery to knock, but the sign was for packages. So the confusion is on both sides. The answer might depend on whether the sign was specific enough. If the sign only mentioned packages, the user is in the right. If it was too vague, they might be partially at fault. But in the story, the user mentions they had signs for packages and a new sign with logos. The food delivery person might not have realized the sign was for packages. So the user's problem is not clarifying that the sign was for packages, leading to the food being left outside. Therefore, the user might be at least partially at fault for not making the sign specific enough. But the delivery person could have knocked despite the sign. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, since the sign said \"Do not knock\" and was visible, the delivery person followed it, leading to the cold food. So maybe the user is in the wrong for not having a clear sign for food deliveries. So answer A.\n"
