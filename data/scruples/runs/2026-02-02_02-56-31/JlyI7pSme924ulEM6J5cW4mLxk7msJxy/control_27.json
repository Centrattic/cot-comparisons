I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author is a new mom who's been getting a lot of packages. She's had signs that say \"Do not Knock\" to avoid the delivery person knocking, which she didn't want. She tried different ways to communicate this but it didn't work. Then she used a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages. But when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock, left the food outside, and it got cold. The husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and expectations. The author tried multiple times to specify not to knock, which the delivery people for packages ignored. When they ordered food, maybe the delivery person followed the same sign but didn't consider that food needs to be handled differently. The sign was effective in stopping knocks, but perhaps not considering the urgency or perishable nature of food.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, she communicated her request clearly, and the delivery person followed it. On the other hand, maybe there's an unspoken understanding that food deliveries require different handling. But the sign didn't specify that. The author expected the delivery person to use common sense, which might not be part of the job's standard procedures. However, the delivery person might have been following instructions literally without considering the context.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the sign was specific enough. If the sign only said \"Do not knock\" without differentiating between packages and food, then the delivery person might have done what they were told. But the author might have assumed that food would be an exception. Since the sign was effective in stopping knocks for packages, the delivery person might not have realized that food is different. So, maybe the author should have made the exception clear. But she might argue that the delivery person should have used judgment. This is a bit of a toss-up. However, in terms of direct responsibility, the author set the rule, and the delivery person followed it. The husband's point is that they asked for it by having the sign. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for not considering that the sign might affect all deliveries, including food. But if the sign didn't specify exceptions, then the delivery person isn't at fault. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the delivery person followed the instructions given, even if the outcome was unintended. The author might need to adjust her sign to clarify exceptions for food deliveries. So the answer is B.\n"
