I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" for deliveries, which worked for packages but not for food. When she got a food delivery, the driver left it at the door, which was cold, and she's upset about it. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's intention was to prevent people from knocking because she's a new mom and maybe doesn't want interruptions. She tried multiple ways to communicate this, including notes on the sign and in delivery options. The sign worked for packages but not for the food delivery. The driver saw the sign but left the food at the door instead of knocking, leading to it getting cold. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nOn one hand, the sign clearly states \"Do not Knock,\" so the driver followed the instruction. The problem is that the food delivery requires immediate attention to keep the food warm. The sign might have been too broad, not specifying exceptions for things like food. The driver might have thought that since it's a delivery, just like packages, they should leave it at the door, not realizing that food needs to be taken quickly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have considered that different types of deliveries (packages vs. food) require different handling. The sign was effective for packages but didn't account for time-sensitive items. The driver followed the instructions given, so the issue might be with the sign's wording. The author expected the driver to use common sense, but the sign's explicit instruction to not knock conflicts with the need to ensure food is delivered hot.\n\nSo, the key points are: the sign's clarity, the type of delivery, and the expectation of common sense. The author might have been too rigid with the sign without considering exceptions. However, the driver could have also checked if the food needed to be picked up immediately. But according to the story, the driver saw the sign and left it at the door, which is what the sign instructed. The problem is that the sign didn't specify that food should be handled differently. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because the sign's instructions were too absolute and didn't account for different delivery scenarios. Alternatively, the driver could be at fault for not using judgment, but the sign explicitly told them not to knock.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's sign might have been too broad, leading to unintended consequences. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the sign's instructions didn't account for different delivery types, leading to the cold food issue.\n"
