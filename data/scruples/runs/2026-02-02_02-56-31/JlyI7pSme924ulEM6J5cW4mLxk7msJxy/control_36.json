I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock after they put up signs. The author is a new mom who's had issues with packages being left at the door when she didn't want them to be. She used signs and checkout notes to specify \"Do not knock,\" but that didn't work. So she made a more prominent sign with logos of the couriers. The food delivery person saw it and left the meal at the door, which was cold. The husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, the signs were meant to prevent packages from being left at the door without permission. She took steps to communicate her preference multiple times. Then she used a more visible sign with the logos, which worked for packages but not for food. The food delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock, hence leaving it at the door. The problem is that the food was supposed to be delivered hot, but it got cold because it was left outside.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she clearly communicated her preferences, and the delivery person followed the sign. But the sign was for packages, not food. Maybe the food delivery service didn't account for that. However, the sign had the logos, which might include food delivery companies. The delivery person might have assumed the same rules applied. But expecting someone to knock for food delivery is different from packages. Food is time-sensitive, so not knocking could lead to issues. The author might not have considered that the sign could affect food deliveries differently. But she was trying to solve the package issue, which is valid. The delivery person didn't check if the sign applied to food, which could be an oversight. So maybe both sides have some responsibility. However, the signs were to prevent unauthorized delivery, which she had a right to enforce. The food delivery person should have checked if the sign was relevant to their service. If the sign included their logo, then they had to follow the instruction. But the cold food is an issue. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting them to knock. Since she put up the sign for her own convenience and the delivery person followed it, maybe she's not wrong, but the situation is a bit nuanced. The answer might be B (No) because she's not in the wrong for setting up the sign to protect her preferences, even if it led to an unintended consequence.\n"
