I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She's been using signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" to avoid the noise because maybe she's trying to sleep or has a baby to care for. The problem is that the delivery people kept knocking despite her instructions. So she changed the sign to one with corporate logos to make it more noticeable. It worked for packages, but when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are her intentions and the consequences. She was trying to prevent noise from deliveries, which is understandable, especially as a new mom. She made her instructions clear through multiple methods, but the food delivery person didn't follow them this time. The result was a cold meal, which is inconvenient, but the user might have had a good reason for the sign.\n\nBut wait, food deliveries are different from packages. Packages can be left at the door, but food needs to be handed over promptly to stay hot. The user's sign probably didn't specify that it applies to all deliveries, just the packages. The delivery person might not have known that the sign excluded food orders. The user might be at fault for not making an exception for food, but she might argue that the sign was meant for all deliveries. However, the sign's effectiveness for packages shows that it worked, but it backfired this time. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person should have used common sense. Even if the sign said not to knock, for a food delivery, knocking to ensure the meal is handed over is necessary. The user's husband thinks they asked for it, implying that the sign's instructions were followed too literally. But the user's point is that common sense should have been used, which the delivery person failed to do. \n\nSo, is the user wrong? She had a valid reason to avoid knocks for packages, but the sign might have been too broad. The delivery person's mistake was not using judgment in this specific case. However, the user might also be at fault for not considering that food requires different handling. The answer depends on whether the sign's instructions were too absolute. Since the user's intent was to avoid knocks for all deliveries, but the sign didn't differentiate, the delivery person might have acted correctly by following the sign literally. However, the user might not be in the wrong because her intention was reasonable, and the delivery person should have used common sense. But maybe the user should have made an exception for food. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer could swing either way, but considering that the user's main goal was to prevent knocks and the sign was effective for packages, but the food delivery was an exception she didn't account for, maybe she's not in the wrong. The delivery person failed to apply common sense. So the answer is B.\n"
