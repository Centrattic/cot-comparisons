I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they're a new mom who keeps getting packages knocked on the door despite instructions not to knock. They put up signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock,\" but delivery people kept ignoring it. Then they used a sign with corporate logos which worked, but now a food delivery person left the dinner on the doorstep, which was ice cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent knocking, which they achieved with the sign. The problem here is that the food delivery person followed the sign's instruction by not knocking and left the food outside, leading to it getting cold. The question is whether the author is at fault for expecting the delivery person to use common sense despite the sign.\n\nThe author argues that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have realized that a food delivery needs to be handed directly, not left on the doorstep. However, the sign was a general instruction for all deliveries, not specific to food. The delivery person might not have known the difference between a package and a food order. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests he thinks the sign caused the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had specific instructions for delivery notes but were ignored. They had to use a more effective sign, which worked too well. The mistake here might be that the sign was too broad. Maybe the author should have made exceptions for food. But since they didn't specify, the delivery person followed the sign literally. \n\nThe delivery person followed the instructions given, but perhaps didn't consider the context. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't tailor the sign to exclude food deliveries. However, the sign didn't mention food, so the delivery person had no way of knowing. It's a bit of a grey area. If the sign said \"Do not knock for packages only,\" it would be clearer. But since it's a general sign, the delivery person just followed it. Maybe the author is at fault for not being specific enough. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment. \n\nBut the key point is that the sign was effective in stopping knocks for packages, which was the author's goal. The unintended consequence was with a food delivery. Since the sign didn't specify exceptions, the delivery person followed it as written. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that different types of deliveries require different handling. They expected people to use common sense, but the sign removed that necessity, leading to a problem. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't account for the different delivery types.\n"
