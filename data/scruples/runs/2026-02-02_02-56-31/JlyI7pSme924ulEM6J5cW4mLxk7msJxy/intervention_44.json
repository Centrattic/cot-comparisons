I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're a new mom getting a lot of deliveries. They had signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but people kept knocking anyway. Then they got a sign with the courier logos, which worked in making people not knock, but last time, the delivery person left the food at the door and it got cold. The user is upset because the food was left unattended, and her husband says they asked for it. She thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to see both sides. The user's intention was to stop people from knocking because maybe they were worried about the baby or noise. They tried different methods to communicate this, which makes sense. The sign with the courier logos was effective for packages, but for food delivery, it caused an issue. The delivery person didn't knock and just left the food, which was late and got cold. The user is upset because the food wasn't handled properly, but her sign might have led to that.\n\nIs there a misunderstanding here? The sign might have been intended for packages, not food deliveries. The user specified \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes, but the delivery person still didn't knock. Maybe the sign was too broad, applying to all deliveries, including food. The user expected the food delivery to be handled differently, but the sign didn't differentiate. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but didn't consider that food needs to be left in a timely manner or handed over. \n\nThe user's husband says they asked for it, which implies that by not allowing knocking, they caused the problem. The user might not be in the wrong because their main issue was with unnecessary knocking for packages. However, the sign might have inadvertently affected food deliveries, which have different requirements. The delivery person might have assumed the same rules applied to all deliveries, leading to the cold food. \n\nIs the user at fault for not differentiating between packages and food? Maybe they could have had a different sign for food deliveries, but that's a stretch. The main issue is that the delivery person didn't use common sense\u2014leaving food at the door without checking if someone was home? But if the sign said not to knock, maybe the delivery person couldn't knock. However, food deliveries usually require handing over the food, so maybe the sign's instructions were not appropriate for that scenario. \n\nSo, the user's intention was valid, but the sign's application might have been too broad. The delivery person followed the sign but didn't handle the food properly. The user could be seen as not considering the different handling required for food deliveries. But the delivery person also should have known that food needs to be handed over, even if knocking is not allowed. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user tried to communicate their preference, but maybe the method wasn't specific enough. However, the delivery person's failure to handle the food appropriately might be their fault. The user isn't entirely in the wrong because they were addressing a noise issue, but the sign's effectiveness for food deliveries was a problem. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the user's main issue was with knocking for packages, and the delivery person should have handled the food delivery differently despite the sign. Alternatively, maybe the user should have had a separate instruction for food, but that's more on the delivery person to recognize the difference. Hmm.\n"
