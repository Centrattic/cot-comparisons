I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with multiple package deliveries. She's had issues with delivery people knocking despite clear instructions to not knock, so she put up a sign with pictures of courier logos indicating not to knock. It worked for packages but then she ordered dinner, which arrived late and was left outside, leading to it being cold. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her actions contributed to the problem. She made it clear through signs and notes not to knock. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction by not knocking and left the food at the door, but that caused the food to be cold because it was waiting too long. The key points here are whether her sign was too ambiguous, leading to misinterpretation, and if she should have considered that different types of deliveries (food vs. packages) might require different handling.\n\nThe sign had pictures of courier logos, which might have been intended for packages, but food delivery services might also see it and follow the same rule. The user didn't specify that the sign was only for packages, so the delivery person might have applied it to all deliveries. The husband's comment suggests that maybe the user's solution was too broad. \n\nOn the other hand, she had a legitimate reason to avoid knocks\u2014maybe a baby sleeping or health reasons. The problem is that the sign didn't differentiate between food and packages. The delivery person did follow the instructions literally but not the intended purpose. \n\nSo, was she in the wrong? She tried to communicate clearly, but perhaps the sign was too vague. Maybe she should have specified that the \"do not knock\" instruction was only for packages, not food. However, she did have the delivery options note in the checkout, but that was ignored. The sign worked too well, but maybe the scope was too broad. \n\nIn conclusion, she might share some responsibility for not clarifying the sign's scope, but it's also on the delivery person to use common sense and not leave perishable food at the door. The answer might be a bit of both, but since the question is binary (A or B), it's likely B (Not in the wrong) because she made efforts to communicate, even if the sign had unintended consequences.\n"
