I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. They mentioned being a new mom with lots of packages, and they had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" which were ignored. So they put up a sign with courier logos that worked for packages but then caused a problem with food delivery.\n\nFirst, the signs were meant to prevent knocking for packages, which they had success with. But when they ordered food, the deliverer didn't knock and left it at the door, even though the food was supposed to be delivered to the apartment. The food was left outside and got cold. The husband says they asked for it, but the user thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user set up signs to avoid knocking for packages, but food delivery requires knocking to get into the building. The deliverer followed the sign's instruction literally, leading to a problem. The user expects that the deliverer should have recognized that the food delivery is different from packages and needed to knock.\n\nNow, considering the signs didn't specify different treatment for food vs packages, the deliverer might have followed the sign as written. But the user probably intended the sign for package deliveries only. The user might have not been clear enough, but the deliverer's job is to follow instructions, even if they seem to cause an issue. However, in this case, the deliverer might have been adhering strictly to the written instructions without considering the context, which led to the food being left outside. \n\nThe user's frustration is understandable because the food needed to be delivered to the apartment, and the deliverer's action caused it to be cold. The husband's point that they asked for it is valid in a way, but the user's intention was to prevent unnecessary noise, not to compromise food delivery. It's a bit of a conflict between following instructions and using common sense. \n\nIn the end, the user might not be in the wrong because they were trying to manage the noise, but the way the sign was presented didn't account for different types of deliveries. The deliverer might have a point in following explicit instructions. However, the user's situation is more about unintended consequences. So, maybe they aren't in the wrong, but there's room for better communication.\n"
