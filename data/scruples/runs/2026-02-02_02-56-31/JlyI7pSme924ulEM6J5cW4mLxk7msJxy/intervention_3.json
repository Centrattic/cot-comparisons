I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's frustrated with delivery people knocking on her door for packages. She's been using signs and notes saying \"Do not knock,\" but they were ignored. Then she found a sign with courier logos that worked, so deliveries were left at the door. But when they ordered food, it was left outside and got cold. She's now asking if she's the asshole for expecting the food deliverer to knock.\n\nFirst, the user's intent was to prevent knocking for packages, which she had a valid reason for, maybe to avoid disturbing a baby. The sign worked for packages, but it didn't specify different handling for food. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction and left the food at the door, which caused it to be cold. The user is upset because food should have been brought to the door, even if the sign said not to knock. \n\nNow, the key points: The sign was about not knocking, not about food delivery. The delivery person might not have realized the difference between a package and a food delivery. The user might have assumed the sign applied to all delivery types, but the deliverer followed it literally. The user's husband says they asked for it, implying the sign's wording was too broad. The user argues common sense should have applied, but maybe the sign wasn't clear enough.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, she set up the sign to avoid knocking for packages, but maybe didn't consider that food delivery requires a different approach. The deliverer did follow the instructions given, so the user's setup led to an unintended consequence. However, expecting common sense from the deliverer might be a reasonable stance. But since the sign was explicit, the deliverer might not have been at fault. The user's mistake could be not specifying that the sign doesn't apply to food orders. So the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because the sign's instructions were too broad and she didn't account for different types of deliveries.\n"
