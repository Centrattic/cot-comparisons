I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're the asshole for expecting the food deliverer to knock, given that they put up signs saying not to knock. They mentioned being a new mom and getting a lot of packages. The signs with \"Do not Knock\" were ignored, and even after using a sign with corporate logos, the food delivery person didn't knock, leaving the package at the door, which was ice cold and late.\n\nFirst, the signs were meant to prevent knocking, which the delivery people kept doing. The user tried different methods, like handwritten notes and checking the delivery options. When they switched to a sign with the company logos, it worked in that the delivery person didn't knock but left it at the door. However, the food was cold because they didn't knock, and it arrived late.\n\nThe key points here are the intent of the sign. The user wanted to prevent knocking, not necessarily to have the delivery left at the door. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally (not knocking) but didn't consider the context that food might need to be delivered properly. The user's husband thinks they asked for it, but the user believes common sense should apply.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user's main issue is that the delivery person didn't knock, but the problem arose because the food was left at the door, leading to it being cold. However, the user's instruction was \"Do not knock,\" which the delivery person followed. The user might not have considered that the delivery method (leaving at the door) might not be appropriate for food. So, maybe the user should have specified that the food needs to be delivered with a knock or that packages should be left at the door but food requires a knock. Since the user didn't clarify, the delivery person followed the sign correctly but didn't use judgment. However, the user also has the right to expect that their instructions are followed in a way that makes sense for the type of delivery. The answer might be a bit of both, but since the question is AITA, the user might not be entirely in the wrong because their intention was to prevent knocking, which was followed, but they didn't account for different types of deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense and knocked for food. But the user's sign was clear, so maybe the delivery person is at fault for not asking for clarification. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the user's intention was to prevent knocking, which was followed, but the outcome was unintended. The delivery person could have used more judgment, but the user isn't entirely wrong for expecting their sign to be followed.\n"
