I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock, given the situation described. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is a new mom with lots of packages. She's had issues with delivery people knocking despite clear instructions not to. She put up signs both physical and in the notes, but they were ignored. Then she got a sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but caused a problem with food delivery.\n\nThe problem is that the sign, which was meant to prevent knocking for packages, also caused the food delivery person to leave the meal without knocking, resulting in a cold dinner. The user's husband thinks they're asking for it, but she believes common sense should have been used.\n\nSo, the key points here are: intent of the sign, effectiveness, and the unintended consequence. The sign was specifically for packages, not food. The deliverer might not have distinguished between the two. However, the user's main goal was to prevent knocking, and the sign achieved that, but with an unintended side effect.\n\nThe question is whether the user is wrong. From a fairness perspective, she's trying to avoid disturbances as a new mom, which is understandable. The deliverer followed the sign's instruction literally, not considering the different needs between packages and food. However, maybe the sign was too broad, not specifying exceptions for food. But given that she tried various methods without success, the solution was to create a more effective sign, which she did. The problem is a communication gap between the sign's intention and the deliverer's action.\n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily wrong because she's trying to solve a problem that wasn't addressed by previous attempts. The deliverer's action, while following the sign, didn't account for the context of food delivery. The user's intent was to prevent knocking, which is reasonable, especially for a new mom needing rest. The issue is that the solution was too broad. However, that's a practical problem, not a moral one. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
