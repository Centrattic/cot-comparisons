I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She's been getting annoyed because the delivery people keep knocking on her door even though she's put up signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock.\" She tried using a specific sign with company logos, which worked for packages, but then when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door, which got cold. Now she's upset about the late delivery and the cold food.\n\nFirst, the key points here: She made multiple efforts to prevent knocking for packages, which were effective. But when it came to food delivery, the delivery person followed the same no-knock protocol, leading to a problem. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nThe sign she used was meant for packages, not food. The delivery drivers might not differentiate between package and food deliveries based on a single sign. So, maybe she didn't specify that the no-knock rule was only for packages. That's a possible oversight. Alternatively, the delivery person might not have checked if it was food or a package, just followed the sign. \n\nHer husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks the sign was the cause. The user argues that common sense should prevail, but the delivery person might not know the context of the sign beyond the visual. The sign uses company logos, which might be intended for packages, so the food delivery person might not realize it's a different type of delivery. \n\nSo, the user's mistake might be not clarifying that the sign was for packages only. She expected different treatment for food, but the sign didn't specify. Therefore, she might share some responsibility because she didn't make the distinction clear. On the other hand, the delivery person should have used some judgment, recognizing that food needs to stay warm and might require knocking. \n\nBut given that the sign was effective for packages, the delivery person might have just followed instructions without considering the context. However, the sign itself might be ambiguous. The user's main issue is that the food was left unattended, but she's the one who created the sign that caused the delivery person to not knock. Therefore, the answer leans towards her being in the wrong because she didn't provide enough information.\n"
