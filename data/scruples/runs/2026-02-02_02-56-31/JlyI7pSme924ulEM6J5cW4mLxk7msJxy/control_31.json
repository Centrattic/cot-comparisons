I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She's been putting up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" to avoid the noise, which makes sense because she's probably dealing with a newborn and needs quiet. But despite her efforts, the delivery people kept knocking. So she upgraded to a sign with corporate logos, which worked by keeping the packages left at the door. However, this time, a food delivery person saw the sign and left the hot meal outside, which got cold. Now she's upset because the food was late and cold, and her husband blames her.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The sign was meant to prevent knocking, but it caused an unintended consequence. The key points here are her intent versus the outcome. Her main issue was to avoid the disturbance of knocking, which is understandable. The sign was effective for packages, but food delivery is different because it requires timely delivery to stay hot. By using the same sign for food, she might not have considered that food delivery needs a different handling. \n\nOn one hand, she made a reasonable effort to communicate her preference, which is valid. On the other hand, she might not have realized that food delivery isn't the same as packages. The delivery person followed the instructions literally, which is their job, but the result was a cold meal. So maybe she didn't account for the specific nature of food deliveries. However, the sign didn't specify \"don't leave food at the door,\" so the delivery person had no way of knowing. \n\nHer husband's point is that they were asking for it by using that sign. But the user is a new mom who's probably overwhelmed and just wants peace. The problem here is a miscommunication. The sign was clear in its intent for packages, but the application to food was a mistake. So while her intention was good, the execution had an unintended consequence. However, the delivery person did their job by following the sign. So the blame isn't entirely on her, but maybe she should have adjusted the sign for different types of deliveries. \n\nIn the end, the food delivery person followed instructions, and the user's sign was meant to prevent knocking, not to specify handling for different deliveries. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong because her main issue was the knocking, and she did what she could to communicate that. The problem was the sign being too broad. Therefore, the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
