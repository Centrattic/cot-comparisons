I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. She's had issues with delivery people knocking on the door even though she put up signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock.\" She finally used a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but then a food delivery came late and left the food cold.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock. From the description, she took many steps to communicate not to knock, including handwritten signs and notes in delivery options. The sign worked for packages but not for food, which led to a problem. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. She made her wishes clear through signs and delivery notes, but maybe the sign was too broad, including food delivery services. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, but that caused an issue because food deliveries typically require knocking to ensure timely and safe delivery. \n\nThe user's husband says they were asking for it, which might make her question herself. But her reasoning is that common sense should prevail. However, the sign didn't differentiate between package and food delivery. So, maybe the sign was too general, leading to unintended consequences. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, she did communicate her request, but perhaps not considering that food deliveries need knocking. The delivery person followed the instructions given, so they did their job as per the sign. However, the user's expectation might be unrealistic if it's a food delivery where knocking is necessary. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. She tried to communicate her needs, but maybe didn't account for the different needs of food delivery versus packages. The person might not be at the door to open it immediately for food, but she expected them to knock, which they did as per the sign. \n\nBut the sign's purpose was to stop knocking for packages, not food. Maybe she should adjust the sign to be more specific. Since she did make her intentions clear with the sign, but the outcome was negative, maybe the answer is that she's not entirely in the wrong, but she could have been more specific.\n"
