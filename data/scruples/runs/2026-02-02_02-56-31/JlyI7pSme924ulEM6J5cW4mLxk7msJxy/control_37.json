I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but when it came to food delivery, the delivery person left the food at the door, leading to it being cold. The author is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author had signs and notes in place to prevent knocking, which worked for packages. But when they used the same sign for food delivery, the delivery person left the food outside. The author expected the delivery person to use common sense and not leave the food there when they saw the sign. However, the delivery person followed the written instruction literally, resulting in a negative outcome.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the situation. The sign was clear about not knocking, but it's possible that the delivery person interpreted it as not needing to interact at all, hence leaving the food outside. The author might have wanted the delivery person to knock despite the sign, but the sign itself didn't specify any exceptions for food. The delivery person is just following the instructions provided.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they wanted to avoid the noise from knocking, especially being a new mom. They assumed that the delivery person would adjust based on the context (food vs. packages). However, the delivery person might not have considered that nuance and just followed the literal instruction without question.\n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that the author's own instructions led to the problem. If the sign was clear and the delivery person adhered to it, then the author's setup caused the unintended consequence. The author might have been too rigid in their instructions without accounting for different types of deliveries.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author set up the sign expecting it to work for all deliveries, but perhaps didn't consider that food delivery might require a different approach. The delivery person is doing their job by following the given instructions. The author's expectation of common sense might not apply if the delivery person is just following protocol.\n\nSo, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong: they intended to avoid knocking, which the sign did for packages. However, the same sign wasn't appropriate for food delivery where prompt and warm delivery is crucial. The author might have failed to specify exceptions, leading to the problem. Therefore, they might share some responsibility here.\n"
