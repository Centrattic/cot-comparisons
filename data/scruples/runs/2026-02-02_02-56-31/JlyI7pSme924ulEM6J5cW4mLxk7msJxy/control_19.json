I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about signs that say \"Do not Knock\" for deliveries. The author is a new mom with lots of packages, so she's using these signs to avoid having the door knocked on, which might startle her baby. But the delivery people kept ignoring the signs. Then she got a sign with corporate logos that worked, but now when they delivered food, they just left it at the door, and it got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break down the details.\n\nShe had signs that said \"Do not Knock\" from the start. She tried different iterations and even wrote it in delivery notes. The problem was that the delivery people didn't follow it, leading to her getting a sign with company logos. When the food delivery person saw that sign, they left the food at the door instead of knocking. The food was cold, and the husband says they were asking for it. She argues that common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the key points here are the intent behind the signs and the outcome. The signs were meant to prevent unwanted knocking, which makes sense for a new mom. However, food delivery is different from regular packages. Food is time-sensitive and needs to be handed over to ensure it's still hot. The author's solution worked for packages but might not be suitable for food deliveries. \n\nThe delivery person followed the sign's instructions to not knock, hence leaving the food at the door. The author might not have considered that the sign applies to all deliveries, including food, which requires immediate handoff. So, maybe she didn't specify that the sign was only for packages and not for food. The delivery person couldn't know the difference unless the sign had a note, but it had corporate logos, which might imply it's for all deliveries.\n\nHer husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that she should have adjusted the signs for different delivery types. The author's argument is that common sense should have prevailed, but in reality, the delivery person just followed the given instructions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, she created a sign that was effective but perhaps too broad. The delivery person did what the sign said, which was to not knock. The author might be in the wrong because she didn't account for the different needs of food delivery versus regular packages. Alternatively, maybe the delivery person should have used their judgment and knocked despite the sign, but the sign was clear. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the sign's instructions led to an unintended consequence that she might have foreseen if she had differentiated between package and food deliveries. However, there's a counterargument that the delivery person should have used common sense. But the sign was explicit, so they followed it. The author's setup caused the problem, hence her fault.\n"
