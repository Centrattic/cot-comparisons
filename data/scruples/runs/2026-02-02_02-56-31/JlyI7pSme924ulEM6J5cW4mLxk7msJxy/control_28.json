I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new mom who has a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" because she gets a lot of packages. She tried various ways to communicate this, but people kept knocking. Then she got a sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but now caused a problem with a food delivery.\n\nSo the main issue is that when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door, which was ice cold. The author is upset about the food being cold and the delay. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. She had a valid reason to not want people knocking because she's a new mom, possibly with a baby, so knocking might disturb. She tried multiple times to communicate this. The sign with courier logos was effective for packages, but food delivery has different requirements. Packages can be left at the door, but food needs to be warm, so the delivery person should have knocked. However, the sign might not have made that distinction clear. The delivery person followed the instructions literally but didn't apply common sense, which the author argues they should have.\n\nThe author expects the delivery person to use judgment despite the sign. The question is whether the sign was too broad, leading to unintended consequences. The author might be in the wrong if the sign was too vague or if she should have specified exceptions for food. However, she did write \"Do not knock\" in various places, and the delivery person still didn't knock for food. The husband's comment suggests that using such a sign is a bad idea because it leads to problems like this. \n\nBut the author's intention was to protect her home environment, which is understandable. The problem is that the sign was effective but caused an issue with food delivery. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not making an exception for food in her instructions. However, she might not have anticipated that the sign would prevent people from knocking even when necessary. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used their judgment to knock despite the sign because leaving food at the door could ruin it. \n\nIn AITA situations, people often debate whether the person's actions are reasonable. The author tried to communicate her preference clearly, but the result was negative. It's possible that the delivery person is also at fault for not using common sense. The author's main issue is that the food was cold, which was a direct result of following her instructions. But if the instructions were specific to packages and not food, maybe she's in the right. However, the sign might not have been specific enough. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't account for the different needs of food delivery versus packages. However, she had a valid reason for not wanting to be disturbed. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the problem arose because she gave instructions that were followed literally without exception, she might share the blame. The delivery person could have knocked, but the author didn't consider that. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, she's in the wrong), but it's not entirely clear. Alternatively, B (no) if the delivery person's failure to use judgment is the main issue. Hmm.\n"
