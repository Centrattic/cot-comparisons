I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a new mom with a lot of packages, so she put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" multiple times. But the delivery people kept knocking. Frustrated, she created a sign with corporate logos to get the message across, and it worked\u2014until a food delivery person left the dinner on the doorstep, which was ice cold.\n\nSo the main issue is whether expecting the delivery person to knock was unreasonable. The author had tried multiple times to specify no knocking, so she created a more effective sign. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, but that led to a problem because the food was left outside and got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the sign was clear. She used corporate logos, which might be specific to package delivery services. Food delivery is different from standard packages. The sign might not have been intended for food, but the delivery person took it as a general instruction. The key here is whether the sign was ambiguous. If the sign only mentioned package delivery companies, then the food delivery person might not have realized it didn't apply to them. Alternatively, if the sign was too broad, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, common sense\u2014should the delivery person have used judgment and knocked despite the sign? But the sign clearly said not to, so maybe they followed the instructions literally. However, food deliveries require a different approach because perishable items need to be handed directly to someone to stay warm or safe. The author might not have considered that food delivery is different and that the sign might be misinterpreted.\n\nOn the other hand, the author went to great lengths to prevent knocking, which she had a reason for, maybe due to a baby sleeping inside. But the consequence was that the food was left outside and was cold. So, was it her fault for not making the sign more specific? Or was it the delivery person's fault for following the sign without using their judgment?\n\nAnother angle: the delivery person could have used common sense. Even if the sign said not to knock, maybe they should have knocked to ensure the food wasn't left out. But the sign's presence might have been taken as a strict instruction, especially if it had logos of courier companies, leading the delivery person to think it was a no-knock policy for all deliveries.\n\nI think the author's mistake was not clarifying that the no-knock rule was only for packages, not food. The sign might have been too broad, leading to unintended consequences. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not being specific enough. However, the delivery person could also be blamed for not using discretion, especially with food. But since the question is about the author's wrongness, the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because she set up the sign in a way that didn't account for different types of deliveries.\n"
