I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom dealing with a lot of packages. She's had issues with delivery people knocking despite her signs and notes saying \"Do not knock.\" She eventually put up a sign with corporate logos to make it clear, which worked for packages but then backfired when a food delivery person left the meal at the door in the cold.\n\nSo the main question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer not to knock. She had signs and notes in place for packages, but the food delivery was a different scenario. The sign with logos was effective for packages but didn't account for food deliveries needing a quick handoff. The deliverer followed the sign's instruction to not knock, leading to the food getting cold. \n\nThe user's husband said they were asking for it, implying that maybe she should have made exceptions. She argues that common sense should have been used, but the deliverer just followed the sign literally. \n\nConsidering the situation, the user's intention was to prevent noise, especially as a new mom. However, food delivery typically requires immediate transfer to keep it warm. The user might have assumed the same rules applied to all deliveries, but maybe didn't consider the difference between packages and food. The deliverer did follow the instructions as given, so there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the user should have specified different instructions for food deliveries. But she might not be entirely wrong for expecting the sign to be followed. However, the outcome shows that the instructions were too broad. So, maybe she shares some responsibility for not clarifying. But since the deliverer followed the sign as written, the user might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe she's partially at fault for not anticipating different delivery needs. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards her not being entirely in the wrong since she was trying to communicate her needs, even if the communication wasn't perfect. The deliverer's strict adherence to the sign also played a role.\n"
