I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door, which she's tried to address with signs and notes. The sign she used worked for packages but not for food. Then, when she ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door, which was ice cold when they realized it. Now, she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess her actions. She put up signs and notes to prevent knocking, which she felt was necessary, perhaps to avoid disturbing a baby. That's understandable. The sign she used might have been confusing because it included courier logos, which could be interpreted as a general instruction for all deliveries, not just packages. When the food delivery came, the person saw the sign and left the food outside, resulting in it getting cold. \n\nHer husband says they were asking for it, implying that the sign might have been misleading. The user argues that common sense should have prevailed, but maybe the delivery person didn't have time to think or didn't realize the food needed to be handed directly. \n\nThe key points here are the intent behind the sign and whether it's reasonable. She was trying to prevent knocks for safety or quiet, but the sign's wording might have been too broad. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, which worked for packages but not for food. \n\nIs she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She had a valid reason to want no knocks, but the sign's effectiveness was limited. The food delivery person acted on the sign, but maybe the situation required a different approach. Since the sign was intended for packages and she might not have considered food deliveries, it's a misunderstanding rather than her being wrong. So, the answer might be B (No), as her intent was good, but the sign's application was too broad.\n"
