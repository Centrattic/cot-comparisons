I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom dealing with a lot of deliveries. She's frustrated because packages keep getting knocked on the door, which they don't want. She tried multiple times to put signs and notes saying \"Do not knock,\" but the delivery people didn't follow it. Then she put up a sign with the courier logos and specific instructions, which worked\u2014until the food delivery came. The delivery person left the cold food at the door, leading to the meal being ruined.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether expecting the delivery person to knock (for food) was reasonable, even though the sign said not to. The user is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the sign was effective for packages, but food is different. Maybe the user didn't clarify that the \"Do not knock\" rule was only for packages, not food. The delivery person might have assumed the rule applied to all deliveries. On the other hand, using the same sign for all deliveries could lead to confusion. The user might have been too strict, not considering that food delivery might require a different handling. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that the method of enforcing \"Do not knock\" was too rigid, not allowing for exceptions like food.\n\nThe user's intention was to prevent knocking for packages, but the sign didn't specify. So, in this case, the delivery person followed the sign's instructions literally, which led to a bad outcome. That points to the user not being clear about exceptions. Therefore, the user might share some responsibility for not making the instructions specific enough. But the delivery person also should have used common sense to realize that leaving food at the door might cause issues. However, the user's sign was explicit, so maybe the delivery person's job is just to follow the instructions given. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user might be at fault for not clarifying that the \"Do not knock\" rule was only for packages. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment. But since the sign was clear and the user emphasized \"Do not knock,\" the delivery person might not be at fault for following it. Therefore, the user could be considered responsible for not specifying exceptions, making them the asshole here.\n"
