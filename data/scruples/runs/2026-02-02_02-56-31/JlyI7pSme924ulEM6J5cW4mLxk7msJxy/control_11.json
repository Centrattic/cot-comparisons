I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of deliveries. She's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite her repeated requests not to. She put up signs with \"Do not knock\" both handwritten and through checkout notes, but they didn't work. Then she used a sign with courier logos which was effective, but now caused a problem.\n\nSo, the situation is that she ordered dinner, which was late, and the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking. It got cold. She's asking if she's the asshole here. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her actions were reasonable. She had a valid reason to not want people knocking on her door, especially as a new mom who might be dealing with a baby. Repeated attempts to communicate her preference didn't work, so she used a more visible sign. That sign worked for packages, but food deliveries are different. Food delivery usually requires immediate handling, so the delivery person might need to knock to confirm receipt. \n\nHowever, the sign might have been too broad. If it's a general \"Do not knock\" sign, it could be misinterpreted. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, even though it's a food delivery. The user expected the delivery person to use common sense, but the sign didn't distinguish between packages and food. \n\nIs she in the wrong? On one hand, she made her preferences clear, but maybe the sign wasn't specific enough. On the other hand, the delivery person followed the instructions literally. The food being cold is a result of following the sign. But the user's intention was to avoid disturbances, which is understandable. \n\nThe key points are whether the sign was too ambiguous and if the delivery person should have used discretion. Since the sign had courier logos, maybe the delivery person assumed it applied to all deliveries. Alternatively, the user could have made exceptions for food. \n\nIn the end, the user might share some responsibility for not considering that food delivery requires different handling. But the delivery person also could have used common sense. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that she made her request in multiple ways and the sign worked for packages, maybe she's not entirely at fault. The problem is that the sign's effectiveness in one context led to an unintended consequence in another. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because she had a legitimate reason and tried multiple times to communicate, but the sign's effect was unintended. However, some might say she should have tailored her instructions for different delivery types. But given the circumstances, the answer leans towards B.\n"
