I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a new mom who's getting a lot of packages. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid the doorbell or knocking because maybe she's trying to keep noise down, especially with a baby. She tried multiple times to specify this in delivery notes, but people kept knocking. Then she got a sign with the courier logos, which worked in that people stopped knocking, but now the food delivery person just left the food at the door, and it was cold.\n\nSo the author is upset that the delivery person didn't use common sense to realize that leaving food unattended might be bad, even if the sign said not to knock. Her husband says they were asking for it, implying that maybe the sign was too broad. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The signs were meant to prevent knocking, which is reasonable, especially for a new mom. The problem is that the delivery person followed the sign literally and didn't use judgment to handle the food properly. But the sign didn't say anything about food deliveries, right? The sign had courier logos, so maybe it was intended for packages. But the food delivery person might have assumed it applied to all deliveries. The author expected that even with the sign, the delivery person should know that food needs to be handed over promptly or kept warm. \n\nSo the author's main point is that common sense should have prevailed. The delivery person might have taken the sign too literally and not considered the perishable nature of food. But maybe the author's sign was ambiguous. The sign might not have made it clear that food exceptions exist. So perhaps the author is partially responsible for not specifying that food deliveries should be handled differently. However, the husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that maybe the sign was too broad, leading to unintended consequences.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points: She tried multiple times to communicate not to knock. The sign worked for packages but not for food. The delivery person followed the sign but didn't use judgment. The author expects common sense. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the sign was clear about not knocking, which she needed. On the other hand, maybe she should have made an exception for food. Alternatively, the delivery person should have known that food can't just be left outside. \n\nBut the author's primary intent was to prevent noise, which the sign achieved. The problem here is that the delivery person didn't handle the food properly. However, the sign didn't specify that food should still be handed over. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because the sign's instructions were followed by the delivery person. But she might need to adjust her sign to account for different types of deliveries. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person's job is to ensure the food is delivered in a timely and safe manner, so they should have used judgment despite the sign. But the sign might have been a strict instruction, so maybe the delivery person had no choice but to leave it. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. She did what she could to prevent noise, and the sign worked as intended. The delivery person didn't handle the food properly, but that's their responsibility. The husband's comment that they were asking for it is a bit harsh because the sign was about noise, not food handling. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
