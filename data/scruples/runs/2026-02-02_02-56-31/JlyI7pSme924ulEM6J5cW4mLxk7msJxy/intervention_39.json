I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a new mom who's been getting a lot of packages delivered. She's had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" on various versions, but they were ignored. Then she used a sign with corporate logos, which worked in preventing people from knocking, but now caused an issue with a food delivery. The person left the food at the door, which got cold, and it was 45 minutes late. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user put up signs to stop delivery people from knocking, probably because she doesn't want to be disturbed, maybe with a newborn. The problem is that the sign was effective for packages but not for food delivery. The food delivery person left the food outside, leading to it being cold. Her husband says they were asking for it, so the sign might have been too broad. She thinks common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have realized it's food and not a package.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she clearly communicated her preference not to have anyone knock on the door. The sign was meant for packages, but the food delivery person might not have noticed the nuance. The sign had specific logos, maybe for certain couriers, but not all. Food delivery services might not be covered by the same rules as package deliveries. However, she might have been too vague with the sign. If the sign doesn't specify that it's only for package deliveries and not for food, then the delivery person might follow it regardless. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person should know that food is perishable and needs to be delivered promptly. Leaving it at the door in the cold could risk it getting spoiled, especially if it's supposed to be hot. The user expected the delivery person to use their judgment, but maybe the sign didn't leave room for that. The husband's point is that by having such a sign, they invited the problem because the delivery person adhered strictly to it without considering the nature of the delivery.\n\nSo, the user might be in the wrong if the sign was not specific enough and led to an unintended consequence. Alternatively, the delivery person could be at fault for not realizing the food needed to be delivered properly. But the user's intent was to avoid being disturbed, which is understandable. However, the sign's effectiveness in stopping all knocks, including necessary ones like food, might have backfired. The key here is whether the sign was clear in its intent. If it was a general \"Do not Knock\" without exceptions, then the user might not have considered other delivery types. But she tried to specify with the corporate logos, so maybe the food delivery wasn't under those logos. The link to the sign might show if it's specific, but since I can't view it, I have to go by the text. \n\nIn the end, the user's actions caused the problem because the sign was followed literally. The delivery person might not have had enough information to know that food is an exception. So, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because she should have made the exception clear or maybe considered that not all deliveries are packages. But if the sign was specific to packages, maybe not. The user mentions the sign worked for packages, so maybe the food delivery wasn't covered by the same sign. However, the user might still be at fault for not anticipating that the sign could affect other types of deliveries. It's a bit of a gray area, but the reaction of the delivery person was to follow the sign strictly, leading to the food being left outside. The user's expectation was that the delivery person would use common sense, but if the sign explicitly said not to knock, the person might have just followed orders. So, the user bears some responsibility for not clarifying that exceptions apply. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
