I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite her clear instructions not to. She put up signs and wrote notes in the delivery instructions, but they kept knocking. Then she used a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but now caused a problem with a food delivery. The delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, and it got ice cold. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. She was trying to prevent disturbances, which is understandable as a new mom needing peace. But food deliveries are different from packages. Packages can be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive. The sign might have been effective for packages but not appropriate for food. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, but maybe didn't consider that food needs to be handled differently. However, the sign was general, not specific to food. She might have been unclear in her instructions. On the other hand, the delivery person should use common sense, like calling or knocking if necessary to ensure the food isn't left out. But if the sign says not to knock, maybe the person didn't know what else to do. The user might have set up a sign that was too broad, not differentiating between package and food deliveries. So, maybe she's partially at fault for not having a more specific sign. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment. It's a bit of a gray area. But considering she had to clarify her needs after the problem, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. The answer could be B (No), but it's a close call.\n"
