I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for package deliveries. She had those signs ignored multiple times, so she switched to a different sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but then caused an issue with a food delivery.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author wanted no knocking, so she used clear signs. When that didn't work, she tried a more effective sign. The food delivery person followed the sign and left the food at the door. However, the food was ice cold when they realized it was left there. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's instructions were reasonable. The user is asking if she's the asshole (AITA) here. The options are A or B.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author had valid reasons: as a new mom, she might not want the door knocked, maybe because she's busy with the baby. She tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock,\" but it didn't work. Then she switched to a more effective sign. However, the food delivery requires someone to be present to ensure the food is delivered properly, especially hot food. The delivery person followed the sign and left it at the door, leading to the cold food issue.\n\nIs the author wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock? Well, she explicitly asked not to knock. The delivery person followed the instructions, but maybe they should have used their judgment. Food delivery usually requires someone to be there, unlike packages. So maybe the author's sign was too broad, not distinguishing between packages and food. The delivery person might not have considered that the instructions for packages don't apply to food. \n\nThe husband's point is that they asked for it by putting the sign up. But the author might argue that she had no choice but to put up the sign because previous deliveries ignored her \"Do not knock\" notes. However, food delivery typically needs someone present, so expecting the same rules as packages might be unreasonable.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's sign was clear enough to differentiate between package and food delivery. If the sign didn't specify, then the delivery person followed the instructions, leading to the problem. The author might be at fault for not making the distinction. On the other hand, if the delivery person should have used common sense to realize that food can't be left at the door, then they might be at fault.\n\nBut the sign had the courier logos, which might imply it's for package deliveries. The user says the sign worked \"too well\" for packages, so maybe it was too general. The food delivery person saw the same sign and applied it, leading to the issue. So the author might be in the wrong because she didn't specify that the \"Do not knock\" rule applies only to packages. Alternatively, maybe the delivery person should have known better.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person might be expected to use judgment, especially with food. However, the sign explicitly said not to knock, so they followed the customer's instructions, even if it led to an unintended consequence. The author might be in the wrong because she didn't consider that food delivery is different from packages. The husband's point is that they asked for it by putting up the sign. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's sign was too broad and didn't account for the different handling required for food. Therefore, she might be in the wrong because she didn't provide specific instructions for food deliveries. The delivery person followed the given instructions, even if it wasn't the best outcome. Hence, answer A (author is in the wrong).\n"
