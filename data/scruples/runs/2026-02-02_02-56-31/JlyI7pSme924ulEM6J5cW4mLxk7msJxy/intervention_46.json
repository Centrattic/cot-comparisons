I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. They were a new mom with lots of packages, so they had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because they didn't want to be disturbed. But the delivery person ignored the sign and left the food at the door, which got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the user thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the user is in the wrong. The main issue is whether the signs were clear enough. They mentioned using both handwritten notes and a sign with logos. The delivery person might have assumed that since there was a \"Do not knock\" sign, they should leave the package without knocking. But in this case, the delivery was food, which is time-sensitive and needs to be given directly. The user probably expected the delivery person to knock despite the sign because food delivery usually requires a handover.\n\nThe user's intention was to avoid disturbances for packages, but maybe they didn't consider that food delivery is different. The sign might be too general, applying to all deliveries, not just packages. The delivery person might not have known the difference between a package and a food order. So, the user might be partially at fault for not making the sign more specific. However, the delivery person also should use common sense to realize that a food order needs to be handed over immediately rather than left at the door, even if there's a sign. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person might have followed the sign strictly, not wanting to knock. The user's husband's comment adds another angle, suggesting that by putting up the sign, they invited the delivery person to not knock. But the user's reasoning is that the delivery person should have used judgment. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. They didn't intend for food to be left outside, but the sign was ambiguous. The delivery person also might have been too rigid. The responsibility isn't fully on one side. However, since the sign was there and the delivery person followed it, maybe the user is partially at fault for not clarifying that the sign applies only to packages, not food. So, leaning towards answer A (Yes, in the wrong) because the sign's ambiguity led to the problem, but maybe not entirely. Wait, but is the user in the wrong, or is the delivery person? The question is about whether the user is the asshole. The user's request was for no knocking for packages. The food delivery is different. So the user isn't wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock for food. The delivery person is at fault for strictly following the sign without using common sense. So, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
