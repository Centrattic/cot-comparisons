I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a new mom who's had a lot of packages delivered. She's been trying to prevent the delivery people from knocking because maybe she's busy with the baby and can't answer the door. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and wrote it in the delivery notes, but people kept knocking anyway. So she made a more noticeable sign with the courier logos, which worked. But then, when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking and it got cold. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. The key points are about the sign and the consequence. The sign was effective in stopping knocks, which she wanted because of being a new mom. But when it came to food delivery, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door, leading to a cold meal. The user thinks common sense should have prevailed, but her husband says they were asking for it.\n\nI need to figure out if she's in the wrong. The sign said not to knock for packages, but food is different. Maybe the delivery person assumed that since the sign was there, they shouldn't knock for any delivery. But the user expected that common sense would make the delivery person understand that food needs to be handled differently, maybe requiring a knock or a call to ensure it's received. However, the sign might not have specified that. So maybe the problem is that the sign was too broad. She wanted to stop knocks for packages, but not for food. The sign didn't make that distinction. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, leading to the issue. \n\nSo, who's at fault here? The user set up a rule, but didn't consider exceptions. The delivery person followed the instructions given. The user might be in the wrong for not clarifying that the rule was only for packages, not food. But on the other hand, she's a new mom dealing with a lot, and maybe the delivery person should have used judgment. But the sign was clear, and the delivery person had to follow it. So maybe she's not entirely wrong. It's a mix. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the sign was too vague. Since the sign was meant to prevent knocks for packages, but the food delivery is a different service, maybe the user should have had a separate note for food. However, she tried to use the same sign, which didn't specify. So the error might be on her side for not differentiating between package and food deliveries. Therefore, she's partly at fault. But the delivery person should have recognized the difference. It's a bit of a gray area. In the end, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because she's trying to manage her situation as a new mom, but the sign could have been clearer. However, the delivery person's responsibility is to follow instructions unless they override them. It's a tough call. The main issue is that the sign didn't account for food deliveries. So maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but part of the problem is the sign's ambiguity. The answer might be B.\n"
