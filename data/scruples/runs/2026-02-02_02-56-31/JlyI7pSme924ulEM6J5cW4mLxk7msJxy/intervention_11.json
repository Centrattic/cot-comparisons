I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who often gets deliveries. She's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite placing signs saying \"Do not Knock.\" She tried using a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but not for food. The last time, the food was left outside and got cold. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, the signs were meant to prevent interruptions, which is understandable as a new mom. But the sign might have been misinterpreted. The food delivery person followed the rule by not knocking but left the food outside. The user expected the delivery person to use judgment, not just follow the sign literally. \n\nThe key points are: Did the user's sign cover food deliveries? The sign had courier logos, which might have been intended for package deliveries. The user didn't specify that the sign was only for packages. The delivery person might have assumed it applied to all deliveries. \n\nThe user's frustration is valid because the food was left in a cold state, but the delivery person followed the instruction. The husband's point is that they set the rule, leading to the consequence. However, the user believes the delivery person should have used common sense, like bringing the food inside if they saw it was left in a cold place. \n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the sign was ambiguous. If the sign didn't specify that it was only for packages, then the delivery person had no way of knowing to treat food differently. The user's instructions were clear, but maybe too rigid. Alternatively, the delivery person should have exercised some judgment. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's signs were possibly too broad, leading to the issue. She might share some responsibility for not clarifying the scope. However, the delivery person could have used better judgment. But since the question is about her being in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes) because her instructions were followed literally, leading to an unintended consequence. But if the sign was unclear, maybe B (No) because the delivery person should have known not to leave food outside in the cold. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards A because she set the rule without exceptions, leading to the problem.\n"
