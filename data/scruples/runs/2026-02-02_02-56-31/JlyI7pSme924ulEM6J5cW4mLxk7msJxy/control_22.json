I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She's put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and used notes during checkout, but people kept knocking anyway. So she found a new sign with courier logos, which worked\u2014deliverers stopped knocking. But then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, and it got cold. She's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether her sign was too broad. The original signs said \"Do not knock,\" which she tried to enforce for packages. When the food delivery person saw the sign, they followed it by not knocking and just leaving the food, which was a problem because they were expecting to be called to take it. \n\nShe might have intended the sign to apply only to packages, not food deliveries. But the sign had courier logos, which could include food delivery services. So maybe the delivery person interpreted it as applicable to all deliveries. The user's husband thought they were asking for it, implying that the sign was too general.\n\nFrom a common sense perspective, food deliveries might require knocking because the recipient needs to be present to take it, unlike packages that can be left at the door. The user expected the delivery person to use judgment, but the sign's instructions left no room for that. So she might be in the wrong for not making the sign's instructions more specific. However, she had a legitimate problem with people ignoring her \"Do not knock\" signs for packages, leading her to create a more effective but potentially overbroad solution.\n\nThe key question is whether the sign was reasonably specific. If the sign only included package courier logos, maybe it should have excluded food delivery services. But the sign included all courier logos, so the delivery person had no way of knowing which to follow. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense to realize that food needs to be handed over quickly, not left at the door. But the sign's instructions were explicit, so maybe they followed it literally.\n\nIn the end, the user's intention was to prevent knocking for packages, but the sign's design caused an unexpected problem with food delivery. It's a case of unintended consequences. While her goal was reasonable, the method might not have been clear enough. So she could be at fault for not anticipating how the sign would be interpreted, leading to the food being left unattended. Hence, the answer is A\u2014she is in the wrong.\n"
