I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom dealing with a lot of deliveries. She's had issues with delivery people knocking despite her clear instructions not to. She made signs, both handwritten and with logos, which worked for packages but not for food. The food delivery person left it at the door in the cold, leading to the question if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the signs were meant to prevent knocking, which they did. But the problem here is the food delivery. The sign might have been misinterpreted. If the sign only shows package logos, maybe the food deliverer thought it applied. But food deliveries usually require someone to be home, so maybe the person assumed they should knock. However, the user specified \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes. So the deliverer should have known. But in this case, they left it at the door without knocking, causing the food to be cold. \n\nThe user's intention was to avoid disturbances, especially as a new mom. But the result was a cold meal. The husband's comment adds to the conflict. The key points are: clear instructions were given, the sign was effective for packages (so maybe over-extended for food?), and the deliverer's action followed the sign but caused an issue.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Arguably, the sign might be too broad, not distinguishing between package and food deliveries. But the user did specify in delivery notes not to knock. However, the deliverer might have followed the sign instead of the note. The user's intent vs. the outcome. Maybe the sign should have been more specific. But the deliverer's responsibility is to ensure the food is delivered hot. Leaving it in the cold without knocking could be negligence. So the user might not be entirely at fault, but the sign's ambiguity could be an issue. However, the deliverer should have checked if knocking was necessary, perhaps. So maybe it's a shared responsibility. But the options are A or B. If the answer is B (Not in the wrong), because the user's instructions were followed but led to unintended consequences, but the deliverer should have used judgment. Alternatively, maybe A because the sign was misleading. Hmm. I think the user isn't in the wrong. The deliverer should have verified the situation despite the sign. So answer B.\n"
