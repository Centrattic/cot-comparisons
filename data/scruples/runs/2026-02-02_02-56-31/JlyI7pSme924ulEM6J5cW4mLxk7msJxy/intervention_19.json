I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking when they shouldn't. She tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock\" through notes and signs, but they were ignored. Then she made a sign with courier logos that worked for packages, but when used for food delivery, it went wrong. The food delivery person left the meal at the door, which was ice cold, and it was late. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, she's trying to protect her baby from loud knocks, which is understandable. She's taken reasonable steps to communicate her preference. The sign worked for packages, so maybe she thought it would work for food too. But the food delivery person didn't knock and left the item outside, leading to it being cold and late. The key here is intent and reasonableness. \n\nShe didn't ask them not to knock for food, only for packages. The sign might have been misinterpreted. The delivery person might have thought, since the sign was there, they should leave it without knocking, but that's not the standard procedure for food. Food is typically given directly to the customer, so leaving it at the door isn't appropriate. However, the user might not have considered that the sign's instructions apply only to packages, not food. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person could have used common sense. If the food is hot, leaving it outside would make it cold. Maybe they should have knocked despite the sign. But the user had a valid reason to avoid knocks for her baby. There's a conflict between her need for quiet and the delivery person's job to deliver food properly. \n\nThe user's actions were intended to prevent disturbances, but maybe the sign's scope wasn't clear. She might have been mistaken in applying it to food deliveries. However, her intention was good, and she had a legitimate reason. The delivery person also had a responsibility to ensure the food was delivered correctly. So, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, it's possible that both sides made a mistake. The user didn't specify that the sign was only for packages, and the delivery person didn't question the situation when the food was left unattended. But considering the context, the user's main goal was to protect her baby, and the delivery person's job is to deliver food properly. The user might not be in the wrong, but the situation shows a miscommunication. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, she's not in the wrong), because her intentions were to protect her child and she followed up on the sign's instructions for packages. The delivery person should have used common sense in this case.\n"
