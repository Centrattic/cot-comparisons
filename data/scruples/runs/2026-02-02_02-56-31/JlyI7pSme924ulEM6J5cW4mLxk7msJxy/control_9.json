I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want delivery people to knock on her door, especially with a baby. She tried various methods to communicate this, including notes in the checkout and a sign with courier logos. The sign worked in preventing people from knocking for packages, but when they ordered food that needed to be delivered to the door, the delivery person didn't knock and left it outside, which ended up being cold.\n\nSo, the main question is: is she at fault for expecting the delivery person to knock? The user wants a yes or no answer based on the scenario. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. She's a new mom, possibly dealing with a lot, and the signs were to avoid disturbances. She clearly communicated her preferences through multiple channels. When the food delivery person didn't knock, it caused inconvenience. The key point here is whether her signs were too broad. The sign says not to knock for packages, but food delivery is different. However, the delivery person might not have differentiated between packages and food, especially if the sign just has the logos. \n\nBut the user put a sign with the courier logos, which the package deliverers respected, but the food delivery person also followed. The problem is that food delivery typically requires the delivery person to knock because the food is perishable and needs to be handed over quickly. The author's sign didn't specify exceptions, so the delivery person followed the rule. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? She communicated her preference, but didn't consider that different delivery types might require different actions. The delivery person followed the instruction, which was to not knock, leading to a cold meal. However, the delivery person might not read the sign properly or realize that food delivery is an exception. \n\nOn the other hand, as a customer, she has the right to set delivery preferences. The delivery person should use common sense, like not leaving food outside where it could get cold. However, the sign didn't mention food. So maybe the author didn't communicate clearly enough. \n\nBut the user did specify \"Do not knock\" for packages, not food. However, the sign used for packages might have been interpreted by the food delivery person as a general rule. The delivery person might not have checked the specific note for the food order. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that the sign was too broad. The author might not be in the wrong because she communicated her preference, but the delivery person didn't use common sense. However, maybe the sign should have exceptions. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted unreasonably. The author's actions were to prevent disturbances, which is understandable. The delivery person followed the instruction, leading to a problem. The author might not be at fault because she communicated her needs, but the delivery person should have used judgment. However, the sign was for packages, not food, so maybe the delivery person overstepped by following it for food. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The delivery person should have used common sense to realize that food can't be left outside. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
