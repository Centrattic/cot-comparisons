I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door, which she doesn't want. She's used signs and notes in checkout to say \"Do not knock,\" but those weren't respected. Then she got a sign with the courier logos that worked, but now when they left the food without knocking, it was cold. Her husband says they're asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the core question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to follow the sign's instructions but also handle the food properly. On one hand, she explicitly told them not to knock, and the sign worked. On the other hand, the delivery person left the food outside, leading to it being cold. The user is upset because the food was left unattended, but she also wanted no knocking. \n\nThe sign's purpose was to stop knocking, but maybe it didn't specify handling the delivery properly. The delivery person might have just left it without any consideration for temperature. The user might have expected the delivery person to follow the instruction (no knock) but still ensure the food is delivered in a way that's safe. However, the sign didn't mention the temperature aspect. \n\nIs she at fault for expecting the delivery person to use common sense beyond just not knocking? The sign was literal, so the delivery person might not have known to check if the food would stay warm. The user could be in the wrong for not considering that the delivery person might not infer the need to maintain food temperature from the sign. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense to realize that leaving cold food is not acceptable. \n\nThe husband's comment adds that they're asking for it, implying that by telling them not to knock, they can't expect the delivery person to go beyond that. But the user's intention was to avoid the doorbell/phone, not to have the food mishandled. It's a bit of a conflict between clear instructions and real-world application. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's explicit instruction was not to knock, which the delivery person followed. However, the result was an undesirable outcome (cold food). Since she didn't specify the method of delivery beyond not knocking, she might be in the wrong for not considering that the delivery person might not use common sense beyond the given instruction. So the answer is A.\n"
