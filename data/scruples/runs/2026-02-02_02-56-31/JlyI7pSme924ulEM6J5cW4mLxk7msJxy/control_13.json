I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" because she didn't want delivery people to knock and disturb her baby. But the food delivery person saw the sign and left the food at the door without knocking, resulting in it being cold when they arrived.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. She's a new mom, so she probably wants to keep the environment quiet for the baby. The signs were meant to prevent disturbances. However, when it came to food delivery, maybe the delivery person thought that following the sign strictly was necessary, even though knocking might be part of the delivery process to confirm receipt or check if someone is home.\n\nThe key points here are the signs' purpose and the different expectations between package delivery and food delivery. Packages might just be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive. The delivery person might have followed the sign literally, not considering that knocking could be necessary for food to ensure it's received properly. The author expected common sense, like knocking to confirm someone is there before leaving perishable food, but the delivery person didn't do that.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? She had a legitimate reason for the signs, but maybe she should have realized that food delivery requires a different approach. On the other hand, the delivery person might have been too rigid in following the sign without using judgment. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that the sign's instructions led to the problem. But the author argues that common sense should have prevailed.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's signs were too broad, not accounting for different types of deliveries. Maybe the food delivery person didn't realize that the \"do not knock\" rule didn't apply to food. The author might be partially at fault for not making exceptions clear, but the delivery person also didn't use judgment. However, since the question is about the author's responsibility, it's possible she's in the wrong for not anticipating that the sign might be misinterpreted in a way that affects time-sensitive deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person could be at fault for not using common sense. \n\nGiven the options, the answer might be B (No), because the author's intention was to protect her baby, and the delivery person's action was overly literal. But considering that the signs were ignored for packages, maybe she should have expected that the delivery person might not follow them correctly in any situation. However, the food delivery person might have been within their right to follow the sign's instructions, especially if it said not to knock. The cold food is a problem, but the author's sign might have inadvertently caused that. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because her intent was to avoid disturbances, and the delivery person should have used better judgment to knock for food. So, the answer is B.\n"
