I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she's a new mom with lots of packages, and she had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" everywhere. The delivery people kept knocking despite the signs. So she put up a sign with the company logos that said not to knock, and it worked for packages, but then a food delivery came 45 minutes late, and the delivery person left it at the door, which was ice cold. Now she's upset because the food was cold, and her husband says they were asking for it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she's in the wrong. The key points here are about expectations and common sense. She wanted to avoid the doorbell/knocking because she's a new mom, maybe with a baby who needs quiet or she's busy. She tried multiple times to communicate \"no knocking\" but it didn't work, so she used a sign that actually worked. However, food deliveries are different from packages. Packages can be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction and left it at the door, but that's not suitable for hot food. So the sign might have caused the problem here.\n\nIs the sign misleading? If she used the same sign for food deliveries, that might be the issue. The sign was made for packages, which are fine to leave at the door, but not for food. So maybe she didn't differentiate between the two types of deliveries. The delivery person probably just followed the sign without considering the context. The author expected the delivery person to use common sense and realize that food shouldn't be left outside, but maybe that's too much to ask. The delivery person might not have a way to check if the customer wants them to knock for food versus packages unless specified. \n\nHer husband says they were asking for it, implying that by putting up the sign, they caused the problem themselves. The user's argument is that common sense should have prevailed. But common sense might not be universal. The delivery person might not think to check if the food is a special case. \n\nSo, was the author wrong? She tried to manage the packages but didn't account for food deliveries needing a different approach. Maybe she should have specified that the sign applies only to packages, not food. Therefore, she might be partially at fault for not clarifying the sign's scope. Alternatively, the delivery person should have recognized that food needs to be handed over immediately, but that's a higher expectation. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the person is at fault if their actions lead to the problem, even if with good intentions. Since her sign led to the food being left outside and getting cold, she might be the asshole. But maybe not, because she was trying to solve a previous problem. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because her intention was to avoid disturbance, and the delivery person's mistake was not considering the food's nature. However, the fact that she didn't tailor the sign for different delivery types might make her responsible. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The key is whether the sign's application was too broad. If the sign was for all deliveries, including food, then the author didn't make that distinction clear. The delivery person followed the instruction, but the result was bad. So the author's sign might have caused the problem, making her at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle is that the delivery person should have used better judgment. However, in AITA, the person is often held responsible if their actions directly led to the issue. Since the sign led to the food being left out, she's the one who set up the situation. So Answer A.\n"
