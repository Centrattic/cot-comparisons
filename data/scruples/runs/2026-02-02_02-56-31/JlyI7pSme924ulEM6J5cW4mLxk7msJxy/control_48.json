I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the new mom put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" to prevent delivery people from knocking on the door, which she found annoying. She tried multiple times to communicate this, but it didn't work until she used a sign with the courier logos. However, when she ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, and it got cold. Now she's upset, and the husband says they were asking for it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the mom's actions led to the problem. She clearly communicated her preference not to be disturbed by knocking, especially since she's a new mom who might be up all night. The delivery person followed her instruction by not knocking, but that resulted in the food being left outside and getting cold. The key point is whether her instruction was reasonable and if the delivery person was obligated to follow it despite the potential consequences.\n\nThe sign was specific to packages, so maybe the mom expected that to apply to food deliveries as well. However, food delivery might be different from packages. When you order food, especially hot food, the standard practice is usually for the delivery person to knock and hand it over to ensure it's received properly. The mom might not have considered that food delivery requires immediate attention to keep it warm. By using a sign that applies to all deliveries, she might have inadvertently caused the problem. The delivery person followed the instruction, but the outcome wasn't what she wanted.\n\nBut on the other hand, she clearly communicated her preference. The delivery person might not have known that the sign applied to food. Maybe the sign was a bit ambiguous. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that the mom's own actions led to the consequence. The question is whether she's responsible for not clarifying that the sign was only for packages and not for food. If the sign didn't specify that, then the delivery person might have reasonably taken it to mean all deliveries. So, perhaps the mom is partially at fault for not being specific. However, the delivery person could also exercise common sense and knock for food. \n\nIn the end, the mom wanted to avoid disturbances, which is understandable. The delivery person followed the instruction but failed to use common sense. The problem here is that the sign was too broad. The author's mistake was not clarifying the sign's scope. So, maybe she is in the wrong because her instructions were not specific enough, leading to an unintended negative outcome. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used good judgment. But since the sign said \"Do not knock\" with the courier logos, maybe the delivery person was just following orders. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because she didn't consider that food delivery requires knocking. However, some might argue that the delivery person should use common sense. But given that she explicitly told them not to knock, and the delivery person followed that, maybe she is at fault. So, the answer could be A.\n"
