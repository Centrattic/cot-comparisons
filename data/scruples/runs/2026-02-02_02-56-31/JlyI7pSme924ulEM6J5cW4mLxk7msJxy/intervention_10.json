I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. They've had issues with delivery people knocking on their door even after they put up signs saying \"Do not Knock.\" They tried different methods, including writing the note every time on the checkout and even using a visual sign with courier logos. The sign worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and just left it at the door, which was left in the cold. Now, the user is upset because the food got cold and their husband thinks they \"asked for it.\" They want to know if they're the asshole here.\n\nSo the main issue is whether expecting the delivery person to knock is unreasonable. On one hand, the user had clear instructions not to knock for packages, but food delivery is different. Maybe the delivery person assumed the same rules applied to food despite the different context. The user might have expected that the food delivery would require knocking since it's a different service. However, the sign specifically mentioned courier logos, and food delivery services might not be covered by that sign, or maybe the delivery person didn't realize the difference.\n\nThe user tried multiple times to communicate their preference, but the delivery person followed the instructions to the letter, which led to a negative outcome. The user's frustration is understandable because the food was spoiled. But was the user wrong in having the sign in place for packages? Maybe not, but perhaps the sign was too broad, not distinguishing between package deliveries and food deliveries. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instructions without considering that food is time-sensitive, which requires knocking.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They wanted to avoid disturbances for packages, which is reasonable for a new mom. However, the way the sign was presented might have caused confusion. The user didn't specify in the sign that the \"Do not Knock\" rule applies only to packages, not food deliveries. Therefore, the user might be partially at fault for not clarifying the context. On the other hand, the delivery person should have used common sense to knock for food, even if the sign said not to. The answer might depend on whether the sign was clear enough or if the delivery person should have made a judgment call based on the situation.\n"
