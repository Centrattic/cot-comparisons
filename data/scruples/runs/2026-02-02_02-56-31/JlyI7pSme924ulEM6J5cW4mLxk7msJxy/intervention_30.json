I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of packages. She's been getting deliveries from couriers and has been putting up signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" because she doesn't want people knocking her door. She even made a sign with the courier logos, which worked in stopping them from knocking. But then, when she ordered dinner, the delivery person saw the sign and just left the food at the door without knocking. The food got cold, and now she's upset. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. She put up signs to prevent knocking, which worked for packages, but when it came to a food delivery that required immediate attention, the same rule was applied, leading to a problem. The key here is that the food delivery is time-sensitive and likely needs someone to be present to receive it properly. The sign was meant for packages, which can be left at the door, but food is different because it's perishable and needs to be handled quickly to stay warm and safe. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock, so they left it at the door, but that wasn't appropriate for food. \n\nThe user's intention was to avoid disturbance, but the sign didn't differentiate between package deliveries and food deliveries. The husband's point is valid because by putting up such a sign, she might have inadvertently caused the problem. However, the user's perspective is that common sense should have allowed the delivery person to knock in this specific case. But the delivery person followed the instruction literally, not considering the context. \n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, the user might have been responsible for making the sign specific enough to handle different types of deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment. But since the sign was clear and the delivery person didn't knock, leading to the food being cold, the user might share some responsibility for not anticipating this scenario. However, the main issue is that the sign was too generic. So, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the sign was meant for packages and not food, she might not be in the wrong. But since she included all couriers on the sign, maybe she should have specified. The answer depends on whether the sign's instructions were clear about different delivery types. Given that she didn't specify, maybe she is partly at fault. But the delivery person also should have recognized that food delivery requires immediate attention. Hmm.\n"
