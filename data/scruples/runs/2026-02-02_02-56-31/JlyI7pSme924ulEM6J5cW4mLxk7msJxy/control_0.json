I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author is a new mom with many packages. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and used the delivery notes too. But the food deliverer left the dinner at the door, which got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The author has a history of packages being knocked on the door, despite her instructions. She made signs to prevent that, which worked for packages but now applied to food. The food delivery person followed the sign, leaving it outside, even though it's a meal that's supposed to be hot. The author is upset because the food was cold and late.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock, given that she had the sign. On one hand, the sign was meant to stop people from knocking, which she needed for packages. But food delivery might require a different approach because the food needs to be handed over to avoid getting cold. The delivery person followed the literal instruction but didn't consider the context of the food needing to be delivered properly.\n\nThe husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks she's responsible because of the sign. But she argues common sense should have been applied. The issue here is about balancing following explicit instructions versus using judgment for the specific situation. Delivery people often have to make judgment calls based on the type of item. For packages, leaving them might be fine, but food is different. The delivery person might not have realized the sign applied to food orders, or maybe the sign was ambiguous. However, the author's sign had specific courier logos, which might imply it's for package deliveries, not food. But the delivery person might not make that distinction.\n\nIs the author at fault? She put up a sign to prevent knocking, which worked for packages. But for food, knocking is necessary. She didn't specify that food deliveries should knock. The sign's effectiveness in other contexts backfired here. The delivery person did follow the sign's instruction, leading to a problem. So, maybe the author is partly at fault for not having a sign that distinguishes between package and food deliveries. However, the delivery person might not have considered the context. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was to stop knocking for packages, but the sign's application to food caused an issue. The delivery person's action was following instructions, but lacking common sense for a food delivery. The answer depends on whether the sign was clear enough. If the sign was for packages only, maybe the delivery person shouldn't have followed it for food. However, since the sign was general, the delivery person might not have known. The author might have created a sign that's too broad, leading to unintended consequences. So, the author could be in the wrong for not making the sign more specific. Alternatively, the delivery person should have exercised judgment. The question is whether the author's instructions were reasonable. If the sign was meant for packages, maybe the delivery person should realize food is different. But the author didn't specify. Hmm. I think the answer is a bit nuanced, but leaning towards the author being at fault for not considering that food deliveries need a different approach. So, answer A (Yes) or B (No)? If the sign was ambiguous, the delivery person followed it, leading to a problem. The author's instructions were not clear, so she's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
