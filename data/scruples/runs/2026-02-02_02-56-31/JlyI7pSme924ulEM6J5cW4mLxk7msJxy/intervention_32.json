I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're the asshole for making a food delivery person not knock, leading to a cold meal. They had signs saying not to knock for packages, but when they used a sign with courier logos for attention, the delivery person left the food at the door instead of knocking. The user is a new mom dealing with a lot of packages, so they probably wanted to avoid interruptions. The problem is, when it was a food delivery, not a package, maybe the rules changed.\n\nFirst, the user had the right to request not to be disturbed, especially with packages. They took steps to communicate that through signs and notes. The sign worked for packages but not for food. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which was to leave it at the door, so the food was cold. The user is upset because they didn't get the food hot as expected. The husband said they were asking for it. \n\nBut wait, maybe the sign was intended for packages, not food. The user might have assumed that the delivery person would use common sense and realize that food needs to be handed over to keep it hot. However, the sign didn't specify that. The delivery person might have just followed the instructions without considering the type of item. The user might not be in the wrong for trying to reduce interruptions, but maybe the sign was too broad. They could have made a distinction between packages and food deliveries. The delivery person did what was asked, even if it wasn't ideal. So maybe the user is the one who didn't consider that different items require different handling. On the other hand, the delivery person should have questioned if food is involved. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the user's instructions were clear, even if they didn't specify, they might still be in the right for trying to minimize disturbances, but the sign's ambiguity could be their fault. So maybe answer B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
