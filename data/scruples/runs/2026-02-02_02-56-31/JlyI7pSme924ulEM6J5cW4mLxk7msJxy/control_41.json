I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has a lot of packages delivered. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" multiple times, but the delivery people kept knocking. So she made a new sign with corporate logos to get their attention, which worked. But then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, it was cold, and the husband said they were asking for it. The author wonders if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are the signs she put up. Initially, she had \"Do not Knock\" signs, which were ignored. Then she used a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages. But when food was delivered, the person followed the sign's instructions and left it outside. The problem is that the food became cold because they didn't knock to let her in.\n\nThe author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, probably to avoid the noise (as a new mom, maybe the baby is asleep or she's trying to rest). However, when it comes to food delivery, the instructions might be different. Food usually needs to be delivered hot, so knocking to let someone in is necessary. The sign might have been misinterpreted. The delivery person just followed the sign's instruction not to knock, not realizing it was for packages, not food.\n\nThe author didn't specify different instructions for different types of deliveries. The sign with the logos was meant for packages, but the food delivery person might not have known to treat it differently. So, the author's mistake was not clarifying that the sign applied only to packages, not food. She expected the delivery person to use common sense, but maybe she didn't make that distinction clear. Therefore, she might share some responsibility here. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because she didn't differentiate between types of deliveries and set clear expectations.\n"
