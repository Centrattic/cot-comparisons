I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the user is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but they were ignored. She also tried writing it in delivery notes, but that didn't work. Then she used a sign with the courier logos, which worked... too well. When she ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and just left it at the door, and it got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The user's intention was to prevent the delivery person from knocking, maybe because she's a new mom and doesn't want to be disturbed. She took multiple steps to communicate this. However, the sign was a bit of a trap because it only said not to knock for packages, but food delivery might require a different approach. The delivery person followed the instruction to not knock, but that led to a problem because food needs to be kept warm or delivered quickly.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the user's instructions cause an unintended negative consequence? The delivery person did as instructed, but the result was worse for the user. The user might argue that it's the delivery person's responsibility to use common sense and determine whether it's a package or food, but the delivery person might not have that context. The sign's wording could be ambiguous, leading to confusion between packages and other deliveries like food. \n\nThe user's husband said they were asking for it, implying that maybe the sign was too broad. The user thinks common sense should have prevailed. But common sense might vary. The delivery person might not realize it's food and just see the generic \"Do not Knock\" sign. The sign had pictures of couriers, so maybe it was specific to package deliveries. However, food delivery services might not be covered by that sign. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user set clear instructions for packages, but food delivery is different. The delivery person might not have the authority to decide whether to knock or not without explicit instructions. So, the user's instructions were followed, leading to an outcome that wasn't ideal. The question is whether the user's instructions were reasonable and specific enough. If the user wanted food deliveries handled differently, she should have specified that, but she didn't. The sign was for packages, so the delivery person acted accordingly. \n\nTherefore, the user might be at fault for not differentiating between package and food deliveries in her instructions. She expected the delivery person to use common sense, but that's not always reliable. The answer would likely be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't clearly specify for food deliveries and the sign was too broad, leading to the problem.\n"
