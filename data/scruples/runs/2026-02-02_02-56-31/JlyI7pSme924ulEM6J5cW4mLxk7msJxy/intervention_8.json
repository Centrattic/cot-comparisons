I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a new mom who gets a lot of packages delivered. She's been leaving signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" but they were ignored. Then she got a sign with corporate logos that worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person just left it at the door even though it was a food delivery. The food was cold, and now they're upset. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the user thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the user's intention was to prevent the door from being knocked on, which she had a reason for (maybe a baby sleeping, etc.). The sign was effective for packages but not for food. The delivery person followed the sign literally, but maybe they should have used judgment. The problem is that food deliveries usually require more attention\u2014they might need to be handed over promptly to keep them hot, or at least checked. The sign said not to knock, so maybe the delivery person didn't want to risk knocking. But leaving it outside could cause issues, like cold food. \n\nThe user might not be in the wrong because she was trying to communicate her needs, but maybe the sign was too broad. However, she should have considered that food deliveries might need different handling. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense. The user's husband says they asked for it, but she argues common sense. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The user might not be in the wrong because she made her request clear, but she didn't account for the different nature of food deliveries. The delivery person followed instructions literally but didn't adapt. So, maybe it's a B (not in the wrong) because her intention was valid, but maybe she could improve the sign for future deliveries. The key is whether the sign was too rigid. Since she had a specific problem with packages, the sign worked for that but not for food. So she's not in the wrong because she communicated her request, but there's room for adjustment. So answer B.\n"
