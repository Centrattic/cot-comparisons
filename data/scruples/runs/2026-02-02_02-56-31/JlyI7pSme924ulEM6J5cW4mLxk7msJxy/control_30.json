I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not knock\" to prevent delivery people from knocking and disturbing her baby. She tried different methods, and finally a sign with the courier logos worked. But then when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, leading to cold food and a 45-minute delay. Her husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, her intentions were to avoid noise for the baby. That's a valid concern, especially for a new parent. She did try various methods to communicate her request, but they weren't effective. Then she used a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but not for food delivery. The problem here is that when the food delivery person followed the sign's instruction, it resulted in a negative outcome.\n\nIs she at fault? Well, she wanted to prevent noise, which is understandable. However, the sign that worked for packages might not be appropriate for food deliveries, where the item is perishable and timely. She might not have considered that different types of deliveries might require different handling. The delivery person followed the instructions given, but the result was a cold meal. The author's husband's comment suggests that maybe they should have anticipated that the sign might apply to all deliveries, including food.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's main intent was to avoid disturbances, not to leave food outside. The sign was a solution to a problem she had with previous deliveries. The delivery person made a judgment call based on the sign, and it backfired. The author didn't explicitly state that the sign only applied to packages, not food. So maybe there's ambiguity here. She might be in the wrong if the sign was too broad and didn't differentiate between types of deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense, as the author points out. However, the sign was clear, and the delivery person followed it. So the responsibility might be on the delivery person, but the sign's design could be part of the issue. \n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the key is whether the author's actions were unreasonable. The author's actions were to reduce noise, which is reasonable. The unintended consequence was the cold food. The sign was effective in preventing knocking, which was the main issue. The delivery person's mistake was not checking if the food was still safe, but the author might be at fault for not considering that food deliveries need different handling. So maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's a lesson here in specifying the sign for packages only. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, as her primary intent was valid, but the sign's application might have been too broad. However, the delivery person also had a responsibility to ensure the food's condition. So the answer could be B, but it's a bit nuanced. The key is that she didn't intend to cause a problem with food, and the sign was meant to prevent noise. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
