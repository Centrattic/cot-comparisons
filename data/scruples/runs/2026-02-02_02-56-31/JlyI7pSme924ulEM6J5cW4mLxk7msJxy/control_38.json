I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a new mom who has a lot of packages delivered. She tried multiple times to tell the delivery people not to knock, using signs and notes in the checkout. Eventually, she put up a sign with the courier logos that worked for packages, but when a food delivery came, they left it at the door even though it was ice cold. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue is whether expecting the delivery person not to knock for a food delivery is unreasonable. The author's main concern is keeping the food warm, right? Food deliveries are time-sensitive and temperature-sensitive, especially if it's something like a hot meal. She had signs for packages that said not to knock, but food is different. The delivery person followed the sign and left it at the door, which resulted in it getting cold. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that she wanted to avoid noise for her baby, hence the \"Do not knock\" signs. However, the food delivery situation is different from a package. Packages can sit outside, but food is perishable and needs to be handed over. The delivery person might not have known to check if there's a different instruction for food versus packages. The sign she used had courier logos, maybe indicating it's for packages specifically. \n\nBut the problem here is that the sign didn't differentiate between package deliveries and food deliveries. The food delivery person saw the same sign and followed it, which caused the issue. The author might have been too broad with her instructions. She expected the delivery person to use common sense, but maybe the sign didn't make that distinction clear. \n\nOn the other hand, as a new mom, she might be dealing with a lot of stress and trying to protect her baby from disturbances. It's understandable she wants to avoid knocks. However, food delivery requires immediate handoff to maintain quality. The husband's point is that she set up the sign expecting people to follow it exactly, so maybe she's at fault for not considering different types of deliveries. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She had a legitimate reason for the sign, but the sign might not have been specific enough. The delivery person followed the instructions literally, which led to a problem. Maybe she should have had separate instructions for food. But the delivery person also might have assumed that food needs to be handed over regardless. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she set up the sign that led to the food being left outside, maybe she shares some responsibility. But she did mention common sense, which the delivery person might not have applied. \n\nI think the answer here is that she's not entirely in the wrong because her intention was to reduce noise for her baby, but she might have not considered the different needs of food deliveries. However, the delivery person's action was following the instructions given. So, maybe it's a partial fault. But the question is binary: A or B. Considering that, maybe the answer is B (she's not in the wrong) because her intention was reasonable, but the method had an oversight. Alternatively, A if the method was unreasonable. It's a tough call. But since the sign was for packages and maybe not food, she might have been wrong to expect food deliveries to follow the same rule. So, maybe A.\n"
