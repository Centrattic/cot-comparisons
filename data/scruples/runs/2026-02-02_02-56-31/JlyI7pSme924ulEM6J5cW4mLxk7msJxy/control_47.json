I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. They had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because they probably don't want the delivery person to make noise, maybe because the baby is sleeping or something. But the delivery people kept knocking despite the signs. So the author made a new sign with pictures of the courier logos, which worked in that the delivery person didn't knock and left the package at the door. But then the food was left outside and got cold because the delivery person didn't knock to let them know it was there. The author is upset that the food was late and cold, and their husband says they were asking for it.\n\nHmm. The main question is whether the author is at fault here. The key points are that they had clear instructions not to knock, which the delivery person followed. But the result was that the food was left outside and became cold. The author expected the delivery person to have some common sense, maybe to knock even if the sign said not to, but the delivery person followed the instructions literally.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock? Well, the author provided explicit instructions, and the delivery person followed them. However, the unintended consequence was that the food was left outside and got cold. The author might argue that the sign was meant for packages, not food deliveries, which might require a different handling. But the sign included courier logos, so maybe the delivery person thought the same rule applied to food. \n\nThe author's mistake might be not differentiating between package deliveries and food deliveries in their instructions. If they wanted food to be handled differently, they should have specified that in the sign. Since the delivery person followed the sign's instructions, the author can't really blame them for not knocking. The husband's point is that they were asking for it by having such a strict sign. So maybe the author is at fault for not considering that food deliveries need a different approach. On the other hand, the delivery person should perhaps use their own judgment if following the sign leads to a bad outcome, but maybe they were instructed to follow customer instructions strictly.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's instructions were too ambiguous or if they should have made it clear that the \"do not knock\" rule was only for packages. Since the sign worked too well and the food was left outside, the author's instructions might have been too broad. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the different handling required for food deliveries. So the answer is A (Yes).\n"
