I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door even though she's put up signs saying \"Do not Knock.\" She tried different methods, like handwritten signs and notes in the delivery options, but nothing worked until she used a sign with corporate logos. That worked for packages, but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door in the cold, and it was late.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to avoid the delivery person knocking on the door, which she found annoying or maybe inconvenient, especially as a new mom. She tried multiple methods to communicate her preference, and the corporate logo sign was effective. However, when it was a food delivery, the delivery person followed the sign and left the food outside, leading to it being cold and late.\n\nNow, the key points here: packages vs. food. Packages are inanimate and can be left at the door, but food is perishable and needs to be warm or handled properly. The delivery person might have interpreted the sign as a general rule for all deliveries, not distinguishing between packages and food. But the author might not have considered that food requires a different handling. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks their sign might have been too broad. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed\u2014meaning the delivery person should have known that food can't just be left outside.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Maybe because the sign didn't specify exemptions for food. But the sign's purpose was to prevent knocking, and the delivery person followed instructions. However, the unintended consequence was a cold meal. The author might have failed to consider that food deliveries need a different approach. On the other hand, the delivery person didn't check if the item was food and just followed the sign.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides have some points. The author's sign was clear but perhaps too absolute. The delivery person should have used judgment, especially with food. But the sign didn't leave room for exceptions. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not making the sign's instructions more flexible for different types of deliveries. However, the delivery person could have used better judgment. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, B (not in the wrong) might be the answer because the sign was followed as written, but the problem was a lack of clarity in the instructions. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) because the sign didn't account for food deliveries, so she didn't communicate clearly enough for exceptions.\n"
