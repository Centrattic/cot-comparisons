I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a new mom who's been getting deliveries. She had signs saying not to knock, but people kept knocking. Then she put up a sign with courier logos that worked... too well. The food was left outside and got cold. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, she tried to communicate her preference not to be knocked at the door. She used both written signs and notes in delivery options. But people ignored them. So she switched to a sign with the courier logos, which made the delivery person leave the food at the door. The problem is that the food got cold because it was left outside.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are her intent to prevent knocking, which is understandable as a new mom who might need quiet or is nursing. However, the sign might have been interpreted as a strict rule that delivery people must follow without exception. The delivery person might not have realized that the food needed to be brought in quickly. The sign worked for packages, which can be left at the door, but food delivery requires a different approach. \n\nShe might not be in the wrong because she was trying to avoid disturbances. However, the sign was too broad and didn't account for different types of deliveries. The delivery person followed the instructions literally, leading to a problem. The user might not have considered that her sign could cause issues with perishable items like food. So, maybe she's not entirely wrong, but there's room for adjustment. But the main question is about being the asshole. Since the sign's intent was to prevent knocking, which she had a right to expect, but the method led to an unintended consequence, it's a bit of a situational judgment. However, the delivery person also might have used common sense to check if the food needed to be handed over. So, maybe she's not the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
