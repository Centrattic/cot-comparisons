I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbances when packages were delivered. She even used a sign with courier logos that worked well for packages. However, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person followed the same instructions and left the food at the door without knocking. The food was cold, and the author is upset.\n\nFirst, the key here is the context. The author had a specific reason for not wanting to be knocked on the door\u2014she's a new mom, so maybe she's dealing with a baby, or she's home all day with packages. She took steps to communicate her preference through signs and notes. The delivery person followed those instructions, which were effective for packages but caused an issue with hot food.\n\nNow, the problem arises because food delivery is different from package delivery. Packages can be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive and needs to be hot. The author didn't adjust her instructions for different types of deliveries. The delivery person followed the same instructions, leading to the cold meal. The husband says they were asking for it, implying they should have considered that their signs might affect food deliveries. The author thinks common sense should prevail, meaning the delivery person should have known not to leave food at the door without checking.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she set specific rules for packages, but didn't account for food. Maybe she should have added a note specifying that the \"Do not knock\" rule applies only to packages. But on the other hand, she's a new mom, which is a valid reason for needing quiet and not wanting interruptions. The delivery person followed explicit instructions, so maybe the fault lies in not differentiating between package and food orders. \n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether she should have anticipated that the sign would affect food deliveries. If she didn't consider that, maybe she's partially at fault. However, the delivery person also could have used some common sense and recognized that food shouldn't be left outside. But since she instructed clearly without differentiation, she might not be entirely wrong. The situation is a bit of a gray area. But given that she didn't adjust her instructions for different delivery types, perhaps she shares some responsibility. However, the delivery person also should have known not to leave perishable items outside. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she followed the steps to communicate her needs, and the delivery person followed them without considering context. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if she didn't account for different delivery types. Hmm. The community often considers the reasonableness of expectations. Her expectation was for packages, but food is different. So maybe she's in the wrong for not adjusting her instructions. But as a new mom, her request is understandable. The delivery person should have used common sense. It's a tough call, but leaning towards B, she's not in the wrong because the delivery person failed to apply common sense.\n"
