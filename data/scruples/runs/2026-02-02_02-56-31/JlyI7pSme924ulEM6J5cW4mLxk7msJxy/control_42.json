I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock, given the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a new mom who gets many packages. She's been using signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" for packages, which worked until they ordered dinner. The courier saw the same sign, didn't knock, left the food at the door, and it was cold when they noticed. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The author's intention was to prevent delivery people from knocking for packages, probably because she's a new mom and wants to avoid disturbances. She used signs and notes for packages, which worked.\n2. However, when ordering food (not a package), the delivery person followed the same instruction to not knock, leading to the food being left outside and getting cold.\n3. The author is frustrated because she expected the delivery person to use common sense and knock for a food order, not a package.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's instructions were clear enough to distinguish between packages and food deliveries. The sign had corporate logos (like FedEx, UPS), which are package delivery companies. Food delivery services (like DoorDash, Uber Eats) might not be included in those logos. However, the sign said \"Do not knock,\" without specifying which type of delivery. The delivery person might not differentiate between a package and a food order, just seeing \"Do not knock.\" \n\nThe author's mistake was generalizing the \"Do not knock\" instruction to all deliveries, not just packages. Food deliveries typically require someone to be present to receive them, especially hot food that needs to be handed over. Packages can be left at the door, so the \"Do not knock\" makes sense for those. But for food, knocking would ensure the food is received hot and properly. The author didn't specify that the \"Do not knock\" was only for packages, so the delivery person followed the instruction literally.\n\nHowever, the delivery person might have assumed that the sign was for packages, given the logos. But maybe the delivery person didn't read the entire sign, or the sign was too generic. The author's husband's comment \"we asked for it\" suggests that the instructions were clear but perhaps too broad.\n\nIn terms of common sense, it's reasonable for the delivery person to knock for food to ensure it's received, even if there's a sign not to knock for packages. The author might have been too rigid in applying the same rule to all deliveries. Therefore, she is in the wrong for not specifying exceptions for food deliveries.\n\nSo the answer should be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
