I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, which were ignored. So she put up a sign with courier logos that worked for packages but caused a problem when a food delivery person left the dinner at the door, which got cold.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which she had tried multiple times through notes and signs. The sign with the logos was effective for packages, but when used for food delivery, it backfired. The key here is whether the author's actions were unreasonable. \n\nFood delivery usually requires the driver to knock or call because the customer expects the food to be handed over, not left outside. The author might not have considered that this sign applies to food deliveries as well. However, the sign was meant for all deliveries, not just packages. The problem is that food delivery typically needs interaction, so the driver should use judgment. But the driver might have just followed the sign without thinking, leading to the cold food.\n\nThe author's husband said they were asking for it, but the author argues that common sense should have prevailed. The question is whether the author's sign was too ambiguous or if the driver should have used better judgment. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the driver might be at fault for not using common sense, but the author's sign might have been misleading in this context. However, the author had legitimate reasons for not wanting to be disturbed (being a new mom). The sign was a solution that worked for packages but not for food. Maybe the author should have specified that the sign is only for packages, but that's not clear. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit ambiguous. The sign was meant to prevent disturbances, which is understandable. However, applying it to food delivery might be an oversight. But since the sign didn't specify, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. The driver also should have checked if the customer wanted the food left at the door. It's a shared responsibility. But since the question is about the author being in the wrong, maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because her intention was valid, and the driver should have used common sense. However, the sign might have been misinterpreted. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A (the author is wrong) because she didn't account for food deliveries needing different handling. But I think the main issue is the driver's action. The author's signs were about deliveries in general, but food delivery is a different scenario. So, maybe the author isn't wrong, but the driver is. So answer B.\n"
