I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who made the sign is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a new mom with many packages. She tried telling delivery people not to knock by putting signs and notes, but they kept knocking. So she made a sign with the courier logos that said \"Do not Knock\" which led to the delivery person leaving food at the door without knocking, resulting in it being cold.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent the doorbell from ringing, which makes sense if she's a new mom needing quiet. The problem is that the sign was effective in stopping the knock, but in doing so, the delivery person didn't knock, leading to the food being left outside and ending up cold. The user is asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nThe sign was specific to packages, but when applied to food delivery, the courier didn't knock. The author expected the delivery person to use common sense and maybe check if someone was home even if the sign said not to knock. However, the courier followed the sign literally, which caused an issue with the food delivery. \n\nThe key points are: the sign was meant for packages, not food. The author didn't clarify that food deliveries should still be handled differently. The delivery person followed the instructions given, which were to not knock. The husband's comment suggests that the sign was a bit of a trap, and the author might have been asking for it. The author argues that common sense should have been used, but delivery people might not interpret the sign that way, especially if it's a general rule rather than specific to packages.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author set the rule, and the delivery person adhered to it. The mistake was that the sign didn't differentiate between packages and food deliveries. The author could have added more context to the sign, but the delivery person might not have known to make an exception. However, leaving food outside without confirmation could be risky, like theft or spoilage. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not clearly specifying that food deliveries should still be handled with a knock. The delivery person followed the instructions as given. The result was a cold meal, which is unfortunate, but the root cause was the ambiguous sign. The husband's point is valid because the sign was effective in stopping knocks but caused an unintended consequence for food. The author's expectation of common sense might not be realistic in a situation where instructions are followed literally.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because she didn't account for different types of deliveries when creating the sign. She expected the delivery person to make an exception for food, but the sign didn't indicate that. So, the sign was too broad, leading to the problem.\n"
