I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who keeps getting her door knocked by delivery people, despite her instructions to not knock. She put up signs and notes, but they were ignored until a specific sign worked. Then, when a food delivery person followed the sign and left the food at the door, it got cold. She's upset because the food was late and cold, but her husband thinks they deserved it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main issue is that delivery people kept knocking despite her instructions. She tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock,\" but they didn't follow through. Then she used a sign with company logos which worked, but the delivery person left the food at the door, leading to it being cold. She's frustrated because the food was late and not delivered properly, hence the question of whether she's the asshole.\n\nThe sign in the link probably shows that she specifically asked for no knock, but maybe the delivery person followed the sign's instructions to leave it at the door instead of ringing the doorbell or knocking. The problem here is that the food delivery service might have different protocols. For food deliveries, they usually need to hand it over to ensure it's hot. If they left it at the door, maybe the temperature dropped because the person wasn't there to take it immediately.\n\nThe author's intent was to prevent knocking, but she might not have considered that for food deliveries, a different approach is needed. The delivery person followed her instructions literally, but the outcome was worse. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that by not knocking, the delivery person couldn't confirm the order was received, leading to delays and a cold meal.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She did follow the proper steps to communicate her preference, but perhaps didn't account for different types of deliveries. Food delivery usually requires handoff. By using a sign that applies to packages, she might have inadvertently caused the food delivery person to follow the wrong procedure. However, the delivery person should have known the protocol for food versus packages. Alternatively, maybe the sign was too explicit in instructing not to knock, leading to an unintended consequence.\n\nThe question is whether the author should have anticipated that the sign might affect food deliveries differently. If she had specified that the no-knock rule was only for packages, then maybe this wouldn't have happened. But she might not have thought about that distinction. On the other hand, the delivery person should have followed the standard procedure for food delivery even if there was a sign. However, maybe the sign was too direct, making the delivery person follow the instruction without using common sense, as the author mentions.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's instructions were too broad or if the delivery person should have used better judgment. The author's husband argues they were asking for it, implying that their own actions led to the problem. The author thinks common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have realized that food needs to be handed over. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author tried to communicate her needs, but maybe the delivery person's adherence to the sign caused the issue. However, the author might be in the wrong if her instructions were too rigid and didn't account for different delivery types. But she was trying to solve a problem she had with packages, not anticipating food delivery. So, maybe neither is entirely at fault, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that she followed the correct steps to communicate her preference, but the outcome was unintended, maybe she isn't in the wrong. However, the husband's point is valid in that they might have not considered the different context of food delivery. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's instructions were meant for packages, not food. The delivery person might have applied the same rule to food, but common sense would suggest that food needs to be handed over. The author might not be in the wrong because she tried to communicate her needs, but perhaps she should have specified exceptions for food. Since she didn't, maybe she's partially at fault. However, the delivery person should have used better judgment. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I'm leaning towards answer B, not in the wrong, because she was trying to prevent unnecessary noise, and the delivery person's strict adherence caused the problem. However, there's a nuance here. The sign might have been too broad, leading to this issue. So maybe answer A, but I'm not sure. Hmm. The answer might be B, as the author's intent was good and the issue was the delivery person's strict following of the sign without considering the context. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
