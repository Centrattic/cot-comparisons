I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom dealing with a lot of packages and deliveries. She's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door even after clear instructions not to. She put up a sign with logos from courier companies that said \"Do not knock,\" and it worked for packages. But when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door in the cold, and it was late. Now she's questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, she tried multiple times to communicate her preference not to be knocked on. She used handwritten signs and notes in the checkout. When those didn't work, she switched to a more visible sign with logos. That worked for packages, but the food delivery was an exception. The food delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, leaving the package at the door, which caused the food to be cold and the delivery to be late. \n\nThe user is upset because the sign was meant to prevent knocking, but the delivery person didn't use judgment to knock for food, which is time-sensitive. Her husband says they asked for it, implying that the sign was too rigid. She argues common sense should have been used.\n\nNow, considering the situation, she had a legitimate reason to want no knocking, especially as a new mom needing rest. The sign was clear but perhaps too broad. However, the delivery person followed instructions to the letter without considering the context of food delivery, which requires immediate handling. The user might not be at fault for setting clear rules, but maybe the sign was too absolute without exceptions. The delivery person also had a responsibility to use judgment, but signs don't always account for nuance. The food being cold is an issue, but the user's primary intent was to avoid disturbances. It's a tricky balance between following instructions and adapting to different situations.\n"
