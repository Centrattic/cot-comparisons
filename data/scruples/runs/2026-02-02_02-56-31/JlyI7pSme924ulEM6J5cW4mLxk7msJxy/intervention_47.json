I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for making a sign that told delivery people not to knock, which led to their food being left at the door and getting cold. So, first, they were trying to prevent the noise because they're a new mom. They used signs and notes in delivery options, but those didn't work, so they made a more visual sign with logos. That worked for packages but messed up when a food delivery person left the food outside, causing it to get cold.\n\nHmm, the main question is whether they're at fault. On one hand, they were trying to reduce noise, which makes sense as a new parent. On the other, the sign caused an unintended consequence. The sign says \"Do not knock\" but maybe the delivery person left the food because they couldn't enter the house. The user's husband says they were asking for it, meaning they should have considered that food deliveries might need someone to answer the door. \n\nThe user argues that common sense should have prevailed. But does the delivery person have a responsibility to handle the food properly even if the sign says not to knock? Maybe the sign was too broad, applying to all deliveries, including food. Since the sign was effective in stopping knocks, the delivery person followed it, but that led to the food being left outside. \n\nSo, the user's intention was good, but the sign didn't account for food deliveries which might require someone to be present. Maybe they should have specified that the sign is only for packages, not food. Alternatively, maybe the delivery person should have called or found another way to ensure the food was delivered properly. The user's fault could be in not making the sign's instructions clear enough, leading to a situation where the delivery person left the food in a way that compromised its quality. \n\nBut the user is a new mom, so maybe the stress is understandable. The delivery person might have just followed the sign without considering the type of delivery. The user could be at fault for not considering how the sign would affect different types of deliveries. The husband's point is that by making the sign, they knew that delivery people might act on it in any situation, including food deliveries. So, maybe the user is in the wrong because they didn't specify the sign's application or consider the consequences for perishable items. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used discretion. \n\nI think the key is that the sign was too general. The user might have overstepped by not allowing any exceptions, even if common sense would suggest that food needs to be delivered while it's still hot. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't account for different delivery needs. But maybe B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to manage noise, which is a valid reason. However, the sign's effect led to a negative outcome, so maybe they should have found a different solution, like using a specific sign for packages only. So, perhaps A is the right answer here.\n"
