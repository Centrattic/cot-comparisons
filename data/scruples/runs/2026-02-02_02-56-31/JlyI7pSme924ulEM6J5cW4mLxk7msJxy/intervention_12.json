I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because the delivery people kept knocking, which she didn't want. She tried multiple times by writing notes on the checkout, but it didn't work. So she made a more visual sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but not for a food delivery. The food delivery person left the dinner at the door, which was ice cold. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, she had signs to prevent knocking. The problem is that the food delivery person saw the sign and didn't knock, leading to the food being left at the door. The food was supposed to be hot, but it was ice cold when they got it. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nThe key points here are intent and consequences. She wanted to prevent knocking for packages, which worked. However, food delivery typically requires someone to answer the door quickly to get the food hot. By using a general sign that says not to knock, it might not have been specific enough for different types of deliveries. The food delivery person might have followed the sign literally and didn't knock, hence leaving the food outside. The user might not have considered that food deliveries are different from regular packages. So, while her intention was valid, the outcome wasn't what she wanted. The question is whether she was wrong for expecting the food delivery person to not knock, leading to the cold meal. Since the sign was general and didn't specify exceptions, maybe she's not entirely at fault, but she could have made the distinction clearer. The answer might be B (No) because her intention was to stop unnecessary noise, but the execution had unintended consequences. However, others might argue that expecting food delivery to not knock is reasonable, but the delivery person should know that food needs to be handed over. It's a bit of a grey area, but the user's actions were proactive to avoid knocks, albeit with an oversight in the food scenario. So, the answer could be B.\n"
