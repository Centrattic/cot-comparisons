I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of deliveries. She's put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but the delivery people kept knocking anyway. So she made a new sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages not being knocked on. But when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door in the cold, leading to an issue. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the problem seems to be about expectations. The user didn't want packages to be knocked on, so she made a rule. But when they ordered food, it was a different situation. Food delivery usually expects the person to be available or to have a secure way to leave it. The user might not have considered that the rules for packages vs. food deliveries could be different. \n\nHer husband said they were asking for it, which makes sense because the sign might have been read the same way by food delivery people. The user might not have realized that the sign was being used for both types of deliveries. So maybe the sign was too broad, not specifying packages vs. food. \n\nThe delivery person followed the instructions literally, leaving the food at the door without knocking. But that led to the food being cold, which is a problem for the user. The user expected the delivery person to use common sense, but the sign didn't account for that. So maybe the user is in the wrong because her instructions were too strict and didn't consider different scenarios like food deliveries needing immediate attention. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment, even if the sign said not to knock. But the user's sign might have been ambiguous. The key here is whether the instructions were clear enough for different situations. The user might need to adjust the sign to specify for packages only, so food deliveries are handled appropriately. \n\nIn the end, the user's sign worked for packages, but not for food. She didn't account for the different needs between package and food delivery. So maybe she's in the wrong because her instructions were too rigid and didn't differentiate between delivery types. The delivery person just followed the instructions as given, which were to not knock, leading to the problem. The user should have considered that food delivery requires a different approach.\n"
