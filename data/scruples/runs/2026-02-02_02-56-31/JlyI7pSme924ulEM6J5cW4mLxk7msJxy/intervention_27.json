I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting the food delivery person to knock on their door. They mentioned they're a new mom with lots of packages, and they've had issues with delivery people knocking despite signs saying \"Do not Knock.\" So they put up a sign with courier logos that told people not to knock, and it worked for packages. But then, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking because of the sign, and it got cold. The user is upset about that, and their husband says they were asking for it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The user's main issue is that the delivery person followed the sign's instructions for packages but did the same for a food delivery. The user expected that the sign would only apply to packages, not food. But the delivery person might have interpreted the sign as a general instruction, so they followed it, leading to the food being left outside.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the scenario. The user wrote \"Do not Knock\" in the notes for packages, which were ignored. Then they used a sign with courier logos to make it clearer. That worked for packages, so they probably thought it was effective. But when applied to food delivery, it had an unintended consequence. The key here is whether the sign was specific enough to differentiate between packages and food. If the sign is general, the delivery person might not know it's only for packages. \n\nThe user's husband says they were asking for it. That suggests he thinks the sign was a general instruction, so the delivery person was right to follow it. The user's argument is about common sense, expecting that food delivery requires knocking to prevent cold food. But the delivery person might not be able to tell the difference between a package and food without an explicit instruction. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user set up a sign that was effective in stopping knocks for packages but didn't clarify for food. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions, which they might interpret as applying to all deliveries. The user might be in the wrong because their sign wasn't specific enough, leading to the unintended consequence. However, the delivery person could also be expected to use some common sense, like checking if the delivery is food which requires immediate attention. \n\nBut in the delivery industry, following instructions as given is standard. If the sign says not to knock, they follow it. Unless there's a note specifying different treatment for food, the delivery person has no way of knowing. So the user might be in the wrong for not making the sign specific to packages, leading to the food being left out. Alternatively, if the sign was only meant for packages, maybe the user should have communicated that separately for food orders. \n\nAnother angle: the user wrote \"Do not Knock\" in delivery notes for packages, which were ignored. Then the sign worked. The sign's effectiveness for packages shows it's respected by delivery people, but they might not know it's only for packages. The user didn't specify that the sign applies only to packages, so the delivery person followed it for food. That's a communication oversight. \n\nTherefore, the user might be in the wrong because their sign wasn't clear enough, leading to the problem. But if the delivery person was supposed to use common sense to differentiate, maybe not. However, the system relies on explicit instructions. The user didn't provide specific instructions for food, so the delivery person followed the existing sign. So the user is in the wrong for not specifying the sign's scope. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should know that food requires knocking. But in reality, delivery people might not have the time or ability to assess each delivery's nature unless told. So the user's sign was too broad. Hence, answer A (in the wrong) is more likely.\n"
