And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had a sign saying \"Do not knock\" for package deliveries. She had a sign with courier logos that worked for packages but when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author tried to prevent knocking by using signs and notes, which worked for packages. But when it came to food delivery, the same approach caused a problem. The delivery person didn't knock, left the food outside, leading to it being cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent and common sense. The author's intention was to avoid disturbances, probably to keep the baby calm. She communicated her request clearly for packages. However, food delivery is different from packages. Packages can be left at the door safely, but food needs to be handled carefully to maintain temperature. The delivery person might not have realized the difference between a package and a food order, especially if the sign didn't specify. The author might not have considered that the sign could be misinterpreted in a different context. \n\nThe delivery person's action was following the instructions, but maybe they assumed that \"do not knock\" applies to all deliveries, not distinguishing between packages and food. However, the author didn't specify that the sign was only for packages. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not clarifying. On the other hand, the delivery person should have used some common sense and maybe knocked to ensure proper delivery of food, which is time-sensitive. \n\nThe husband's comment suggests that the author's setup led to the problem. But the author argues that common sense should have prevailed. This is a bit of a gray area. If the sign was clear enough to specify that it's for packages only, then the delivery person is at fault. If the sign was ambiguous, then the author shares some responsibility. \n\nLooking at the sign image (though I can't see it, the link is provided), if it's a general \"Do not knock\" without exceptions, then the delivery person followed the instructions. But the food delivery situation is different. So maybe the author should have made a separate sign for food deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person should have recognized that food needs to be delivered immediately and knocked despite the sign. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of both. The author might not be entirely in the wrong since she was trying to avoid disturbances, but she could have been clearer. The delivery person also didn't use common sense. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Since she set up the sign and the delivery person followed it, maybe the author is not entirely at fault. But she might be partially responsible for not considering the different needs of food deliveries. So, depending on the perspective, the answer could be either, but generally, in such cases, the responsibility is shared. However, the user wants a binary answer: A for yes (author wrong) or B for no. Given the information, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author tried to communicate her needs, but the delivery person's actions led to the issue. However, some might argue that the author's setup was the cause. But the author's intent was reasonable, so the answer is B.\n"
