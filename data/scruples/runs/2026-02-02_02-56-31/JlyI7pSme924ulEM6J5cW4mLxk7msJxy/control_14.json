I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had a sign saying not to knock, which delivery people ignored. So she made a stronger sign with courier logos that worked in making them not knock, but then when she ordered food, they left it at the door even though it was 45 minutes late. The food was cold, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent deliveries from disrupting her, especially as a new mom. She tried various methods to communicate \"no knocking,\" which were ineffective. The new sign with logos worked, but maybe too well. The delivery person didn't knock, but left the food at the door, which led to it being cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she wanted to avoid disturbances, which is understandable. The sign might have been intended to stop people from knocking, but the delivery person left the food at the door instead of calling or finding another way to alert. However, maybe she should have considered that sometimes deliveries need a different approach. But the sign was specific to not knock, not to leave it at the door. So maybe the delivery person followed the instruction literally but didn't think beyond. \n\nThe key points are: she took steps to prevent knocking, which worked but had unintended consequences. The delivery person didn't knock, but left the food at the door, which might not have been the best action. The author might not be at fault for setting clear instructions, but perhaps she should have considered that the delivery person might need to alert in another way. However, the instruction was explicit, so maybe the delivery person is at fault for not contacting her. \n\nIn terms of the question, the author is asking if she's the asshole. The answer depends on whether she's responsible for the delivery person's actions. Since she communicated her preference, but the delivery person didn't use judgment beyond that, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in typical AITA scenarios, if someone follows instructions that lead to a problem, the person who set the instructions might share some blame. But in this case, maybe the delivery person should have used common sense. However, the author's sign was clear, so maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because she communicated her needs, and the delivery person didn't adapt appropriately. The problem was the delivery person's failure to handle the situation beyond just not knocking. So the author isn't the asshole.\n"
