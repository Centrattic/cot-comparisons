I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock. They're a new mom with lots of packages, so they put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" but the delivery people kept knocking. Then they put a different sign with company logos, which worked for packages but now when they ordered food, the delivery person left it on the door and it got cold. The husband says they asked for it, but the user feels common sense should apply.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The initial problem was that delivery people were knocking despite the \"Do not Knock\" signs. The user switched to a sign with company logos, maybe indicating where to leave packages. That worked for packages, but when a food delivery came, the person followed the sign and left it outside, leading to it getting cold. The user is upset because they expected the delivery person to knock for food even though the sign said not to for packages.\n\nIs the user at fault? The sign was specific to packages, but maybe the delivery person applied it to all deliveries. The user might not have clarified that the sign was only for packages, not food. The delivery person might not have known the difference. Alternatively, the user might expect that food deliveries require knocking since it's perishable, but the sign didn't specify that. The user's husband thinks they asked for it, implying that the sign's effectiveness led to this problem. So, maybe the user didn't consider that the sign could be misinterpreted for food deliveries. Therefore, the user might share some responsibility for not clarifying the sign's scope. But others might argue that the delivery person should use common sense and knock for food. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might hinge on whether the sign was too ambiguous. If the sign clearly stated \"Do not knock for packages, but do knock for food,\" it would be clearer. Since it didn't, the delivery person followed the sign's instructions, so the user might be in the wrong. Answering A or B depends on that reasoning.\n"
