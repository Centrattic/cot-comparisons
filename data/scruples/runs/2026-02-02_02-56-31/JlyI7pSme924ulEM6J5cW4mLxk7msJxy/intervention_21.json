I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite her clear instructions. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" and even tried different versions. But those didn't work, so she got a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but caused a problem with food delivery. The food was delivered 45 minutes late and was cold. Now she's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. As a new mom, she probably wants to minimize disturbances, especially if she's dealing with a baby. The previous attempts to stop the knocking weren't effective, so she took a more visible approach with the courier logos. The sign worked for packages but not for the food delivery. The delivery person didn't knock, left the food at the door, and it was cold when they noticed. She's frustrated because the food was late and cold, and her husband says they were asking for it. She thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nNow, the other side. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions, which said not to knock. But for food deliveries, especially hot food, it's usually expected that the delivery person would knock to ensure the recipient is available to take the food promptly. Leaving it at the door might be standard for packages but not for food, which can get cold. The driver might not have realized the difference, or maybe the sign didn't specify different handling for food. \n\nThe key points here are the intent of the sign and the expectations of delivery services. The sign was effective in stopping knocks for packages, but food delivery is a different scenario. The person might not have considered that food delivery requires immediate handoff to keep it warm. By not having the delivery person knock, the food was left unattended and got cold. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she tried to communicate her preference clearly, but maybe she didn't account for different types of deliveries. However, her intention was to prevent knocks, which she had a right to expect. The delivery person followed the sign, which might not have been specific enough. The problem arises from the ambiguity of the sign not distinguishing between package and food deliveries. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person could have used common sense and knocked for food, even if the sign said not to. But if the sign was clear and the courier was following strict instructions, maybe they felt bound to comply. It's a bit of a gray area. The person's goal was reasonable, but the result was unintended. The husband's comment that they \"were asking for it\" might be harsh, as the issue was an oversight, not malicious intent. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, No, she's not in the wrong. She made a reasonable attempt to prevent disturbances, but the sign's lack of specificity led to an unintended consequence. The delivery person should have used discretion, especially with food. Common sense on the delivery side could have mitigated the problem.\n"
