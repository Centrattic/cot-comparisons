I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want delivery people to knock on her door. She used both handwritten signs and notes in delivery options, but people kept knocking. Then she got a sign with corporate logos, which worked in stopping the knocking but caused an issue when the food delivery person left a hot meal outside, resulting in it getting cold.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's break it down. First, her intention was to prevent knocking, which she had a valid reason for\u2014being a new mom might mean she needs quiet or doesn't want to be disturbed. She tried multiple ways to communicate this, but they weren't effective until the sign with logos. The sign worked, but the consequence was that the food delivery person didn't knock, leading to the meal being left outside and getting cold.\n\nNow, the delivery person's job is to ensure the food is delivered properly, which typically involves knocking or ringing the doorbell to get the recipient's attention. By putting up a sign that says not to knock, the author is effectively instructing the delivery person not to do their usual procedure. However, in this case, the delivery person followed the instruction literally, which led to an unintended problem. The food was supposed to be delivered hot, but leaving it at the door caused it to cool down. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author wanted no knocking, but she might not have anticipated that the delivery person would leave the food without any contact. The sign's effectiveness in stopping the knocking is clear, but the lack of communication about what to do in such cases might be the issue. The delivery person didn't have any other instructions, so they followed the \"do not knock\" rule but didn't check if the recipient was home. \n\nFrom a common sense perspective, when someone asks not to knock, the alternative might be to call or leave a note, but the sign didn't specify that. So, the author's sign might have been too restrictive without providing an alternative method of notification. However, the delivery person also has a duty to ensure the food is delivered correctly. If leaving it at the door without checking in isn't feasible because the food needs to be hot, then the delivery person might have a case in not following the instruction if it compromises the delivery quality. \n\nBut the author's main issue was that she wanted to avoid the noise, and she communicated that clearly via the sign. However, she didn't consider that the delivery person might need to notify her in another way. The problem here is the lack of a middle ground. The author's sign was absolute (\"Do not knock\"), without allowing for other forms of communication. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author's intention was to avoid disturbance, which is understandable. The delivery person followed the instruction but didn't realize that the food needed to be delivered immediately. However, the delivery person's job is to ensure the food is delivered under the correct conditions. If the sign made it impossible to do that, the delivery person might have a responsibility to find another solution, like calling the recipient. \n\nBut in reality, many delivery services rely on the customer to answer the door. If the customer isn't there, they can't just wait indefinitely. So, in this case, the delivery person did follow the instruction (no knocking), but the outcome was bad because the food couldn't be left unattended. The author's sign didn't account for that scenario. \n\nSo, who is at fault? The author's sign was effective in stopping the knocking but didn't consider the delivery process's requirements. However, the delivery person should have recognized that leaving a hot meal outside might not be appropriate and should have tried another method, like calling. But if the sign explicitly said not to knock, maybe the delivery person had no option but to leave it there to avoid violating the instruction. \n\nIn conclusion, the fault isn't entirely on one side. The author's sign was too strict without providing alternatives, and the delivery person might have needed to use another method. However, since the author's primary goal was to prevent noise, which she communicated, but the result was a conflict in priorities (quiet vs. proper delivery), the answer might depend on whether the author should have anticipated the need for an alternative notification method. Given that, the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because she had a valid reason and communicated it, but the delivery person could have been more proactive. However, in the context of the AITA question, the focus is on the author's actions. Since she didn't consider the delivery implications, maybe she's partially at fault. But the question is whether she's the asshole. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because her intention was to avoid disturbance, and the delivery person should have handled it differently.\n"
