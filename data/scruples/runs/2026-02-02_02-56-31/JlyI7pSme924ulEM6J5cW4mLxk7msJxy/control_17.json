I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. The author is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want people knocking, maybe to avoid waking the baby or causing noise. She tried various ways to communicate this, including notes on the packages and in delivery options, but they were ignored. So she got a sign with the courier logos that worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent knocking, which makes sense, especially as a new mom needing quiet. She made multiple attempts to communicate this. The sign worked for packages, but food is different. Food delivery usually requires immediate attention to keep it warm. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions but didn't knock, leading to a cold meal. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the author argues common sense should have prevailed.\n\nIs the author wrong for expecting the delivery person to not knock for food? Well, she explicitly told not to knock in all possible ways, but maybe she should have made a distinction between packages and food. However, she didn't have a way to specify that in her sign. The sign was for the couriers in general, not differentiating between package types. So maybe the delivery person followed the sign literally, not considering the perishable nature of food. \n\nBut the author's sign was about not knocking, which is a reasonable request for packages. Food delivery is different, but she didn't account for that. However, she might not have realized the difference. The problem is that the sign was too broad. The delivery person did follow the instructions given, but the outcome was negative. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because she was consistent in her communication, and the delivery person didn't use judgment. However, maybe she should have anticipated that food delivery needs different handling. The key here is whether the sign was a reasonable request. Since she's a new mom, her needs are valid, but food delivery is time-sensitive. \n\nIn the end, the sign was effective for packages but not for food. The author's intention was to prevent knocking, but the result was a cold meal. The delivery person followed the sign, so maybe the author is at fault for not considering the difference between package and food delivery. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the sign was too generic. The author's main issue was with knocking, not where to leave items. So when the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, they followed the instruction, but the author expected the delivery person to use judgment. Since she didn't specify different handling for food, maybe the delivery person is not at fault. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because her sign didn't account for the perishable nature of food. So answer A.\n"
