I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a new mom with a lot of packages. She used to have signs saying \"Do not Knock\" but people kept ignoring them. Then she found a new sign with the courier logos, and that worked. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door because of the sign, and it got cold. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, she had a legitimate reason to not want people knocking because she's a new mom, maybe with a baby, and not wanting to be disturbed. She tried multiple times to communicate that. The signs with the logos were specific to the courier, so maybe the delivery people were following those instructions. The problem is that when the delivery person followed the sign, it caused a problem because the food was supposed to be hot but ended up cold.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she put up the sign to prevent knocking, which she had a reason for. But maybe she should have considered that food deliveries are different from packages. Maybe there's a difference between a package that can be left and something that needs to be delivered hot. The sign might be appropriate for packages but not for food. The delivery person followed the sign, which was clear, but the result was an issue. \n\nHer husband said they were asking for it, implying that using the sign led to the problem. She argues that common sense should have prevailed. But the delivery person might not have thought to question the sign, especially if it was clear and from the courier's own logos. Maybe she didn't specify that the sign only applied to packages and not food. The sign's wording might have been too broad. \n\nSo, is she at fault? Maybe because she didn't make the exception for food deliveries. But she also had a valid need to not be disturbed. It's a bit of a tricky situation. The main issue is that the solution she implemented (the sign) worked too well, leading to an unintended consequence. But was it her responsibility to foresee that? Or is the delivery person responsible for using common sense when following the instructions?\n\nIn the end, it's a mix. She wanted to avoid disturbances, but the sign's effect on food delivery wasn't anticipated. So maybe she's partially at fault for not considering that scenario. However, the delivery person could have used their judgment to knock and ensure the food was delivered properly despite the sign. But since the sign was specific to the courier and said \"Do not knock,\" they might have been following protocol. \n\nI think the answer is a bit of both, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the sign was put up for a good reason and the delivery person followed it as instructed, the author's intention wasn't to cause a problem but to avoid disturbances. However, the outcome was negative. But in the AITA context, maybe the answer is that she's not in the wrong because the delivery person followed the instructions explicitly. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
