I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. They had a sign saying not to knock for packages, but the delivery person followed it for a food order, leaving the food outside in the cold. The user is a new mom, so maybe they're really stressed and just want to avoid the hassle of opening the door multiple times.\n\nFirst, the sign was meant for packages, not food deliveries. They might not have considered that different types of deliveries might require different handling. The delivery person followed the sign literally, which caused the food to be left outside. The user's intention was to stop people from knocking when they weren't home for packages, but the food delivery was a different situation. \n\nThey mentioned using the sign with logos to clarify, but maybe they should have specified that it's for packages only. The delivery person might not have realized the sign didn't apply to food orders. The user's husband said they were asking for it, which is harsh, but maybe there's a point there. The user expects others to use common sense, but the delivery person might not have enough context to know the sign doesn't apply to hot food.\n\nSo, the user's mistake was not being specific enough about the sign's purpose. They assumed the delivery person would understand the context, but the person followed instructions literally. However, the user's main issue is the packages, not food, so maybe they should adjust the sign. The food being left outside was an oversight, but they might not be entirely in the wrong. It's a misunderstanding rather than a deliberate wrongdoing.\n\nAnswer B. No (I am not in the wrong).\n"
