I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then she put up a sign with courier logos, and it worked until a food delivery person left the ice cold food at the door. She's asking if she's the asshole for expecting the delivery person to knock.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The signs were meant to prevent knocking, which the mom didn't want because she's a new parent, maybe with a baby who gets disturbed by loud knocks. The delivery people ignored her written instructions. She then used a more visible sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but caused an issue with food delivery. The food delivery person left the ice cold food, which is a problem because it should be kept cold for safety.\n\nThe user wants to know if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the mom was trying to communicate her needs clearly with signs. She followed the delivery options notes. The fact that the delivery people ignored her could imply that it's their fault for not following instructions. Also, the sign with the courier logos was effective for packages but not for food, which might be a different scenario. Food delivery might require a different handling compared to regular packages. Maybe the delivery person didn't realize the food was time-sensitive or needed to be kept cold. The mom might not have considered that the sign's instructions could conflict with the requirement to handle perishable items properly.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's intention was to prevent knocking, which she had a right to, especially as a new parent. The delivery person's failure to knock could have led to the food being left out. However, the sign might be ambiguous. If the sign says \"Do not knock,\" maybe the delivery person assumed they could leave it at the door regardless of the item's nature. The mom might be in the wrong if her instructions were too rigid and didn't account for exceptions like food needing immediate attention. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense to determine that leaving food unattended could be harmful, even if the sign said not to knock.\n\nAnother angle: the sign with the logos might be more effective, but maybe it's not clear about exceptions. If the delivery person saw the sign and thought, \"I shouldn't knock,\" they left the food outside, which compromised its safety. The mom might have failed to consider that some deliveries need immediate handling. However, the delivery person also didn't check if the food would be safe left outside. There could be a shared responsibility here.\n\nIn the end, the question is whether the mom's expectation was reasonable. If she wanted no knocking, but food needs to be handled differently, perhaps she didn't account for that in her instructions. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense to realize that leaving food outside would be unsafe. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests he thinks they're at fault. The mom's response is that common sense should have prevailed.\n\nI think the key is whether the sign's instructions were too absolute. If the mom's sign didn't account for exceptions, she might be in the wrong. However, if the delivery person didn't use common sense, then the fault is theirs. The answer might depend on whether the sign was ambiguous or too rigid. The sign with the courier logos might be a bit of a joke or a strong statement, which could lead to misunderstandings. So maybe the mom's approach was a bit harsh, leading to an unintended consequence. Therefore, she could be in the wrong (A), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the delivery person should have known better (B). Hmm.\n"
