I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom dealing with a lot of deliveries. She's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite clear instructions not to. She put up a sign with pictures of the courier logos and wrote \"Do not knock\" multiple times. It worked for packages, but when they ordered dinner, the food delivery person left it at the door, and it got cold.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock. Let's consider the context. She's a new mom, which might make her more stressed or in need of clear communication. She made her instructions explicit in the notes and on the sign. The sign was effective for packages, but when a food delivery came late, the person didn't knock and left it outside. The food was ice cold, leading to frustration. \n\nOn the one hand, she explicitly told not to knock, and the delivery person followed the sign's instruction. Food deliveries might be different from packages; maybe the assumption is that you can't wait for them, so they leave it at the door. But she might argue that food requires more attention, especially if it's perishable. However, the delivery person might not know that the recipient is a new mom or that the food's temperature is crucial. The user might think they have the right to expect the same service as with other deliveries, but the sign was specific to packages, perhaps not food. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that maybe the sign didn't account for food deliveries. The user's frustration is valid because the food got cold, but the delivery person followed the given instructions. There's a conflict between the explicit instructions and the expected service for different types of deliveries. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user provided clear instructions, but maybe didn't consider that food delivery might require a different approach. However, the delivery person should have used common sense, like calling or knocking despite the sign to ensure the food wasn't left in the cold. On the other hand, the sign was there for a reason\u2014maybe there were security concerns or other issues with knocking. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She gave clear instructions, but perhaps didn't account for the difference between packages and food. The delivery person followed the instructions but didn't use judgment, which led to the problem. The user's frustration is understandable, but maybe she should have adjusted the sign to include exceptions for food. However, since the sign didn't specify, the delivery person acted correctly. So, maybe it's not entirely her fault, but there's some nuance here. The answer would depend on whether the sign's instructions were too broad or if the delivery person should have exercised judgment regardless of the instructions.\n"
