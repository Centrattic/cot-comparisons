I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a new mom who's been getting a lot of packages delivered. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" multiple times, but the deliverers kept ignoring them. So she made a sign with the courier logos and put it up. It worked for packages, but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door instead of knocking, and the food was cold. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her actions were reasonable. She had explicit instructions not to knock, and the delivery person followed the sign. The problem is that the sign might have been misinterpreted or taken too literally. The key points here are intent and common sense. She wanted to prevent packages from being left at the door, so she used the sign. But when it came to a food delivery, which is time-sensitive and typically requires knocking to prevent spoilage, the delivery person followed the same rule. \n\nIs it her fault for using a sign that the courier followed? The sign was specific to packages, but maybe the food delivery person saw the same sign and thought it applied to all deliveries. However, the user might not have made that distinction clear. If the sign only mentioned packages, maybe the food delivery person should have used their judgment. Alternatively, if the sign was a general instruction, the user is responsible. \n\nAlso, the user mentioned writing \"Do not knock\" in every checkout note. That's on the delivery side, so she made it clear. The sign with logos might have been a bit confusing if it didn't specify that it's for packages only. But the user's intention was to stop packages from being left, not food. The delivery person might have thought the sign applied to all types of deliveries, leading to the mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might have been too rigid. Even though she had valid reasons (a new mom, maybe not wanting to get up or have the baby cry), expecting all delivery people to read and interpret the sign correctly is a bit much. Food deliveries are usually expected to be handled differently. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the sign was ambiguous. If it said \"Do not knock for packages\" and the food delivery is separate, maybe the delivery person made an error. But if the sign was a general instruction without specifying, then the user's fault. The image link is to a sign with courier logos and \"Do not knock\" message. From that, it's possible the sign was meant for package deliveries, not food. However, the delivery person might not have realized the difference. \n\nThe user's husband says they were asking for it, implying that they should have known the sign could cause issues. The user argues that common sense should prevail. In that case, the delivery person should have knocked for food even if the sign was there. But the user didn't clearly state that the sign was only for packages. \n\nConsidering all this, the user's sign was to prevent packages from being left, but it might have been misapplied to food deliveries. The delivery person followed the sign, which was supposed to be for packages, but the user didn't make that distinction clear. So, maybe she's in the wrong for not specifying that the sign doesn't apply to food. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used their judgment for a time-sensitive food delivery. \n\nI think the main issue is that the sign was not specific enough. If she wanted to prevent packages from being left at the door, the sign should have mentioned that. For food deliveries, which are perishable, the standard practice is to knock. By not making it clear that the \"Do not knock\" sign was only for packages, she might have caused the problem. Therefore, the answer is A, she is in the wrong.\n"
