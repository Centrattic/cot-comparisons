I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. They're a new mom who gets a lot of packages and deliveries. They tried putting up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" but it didn't work. Then they put up a sign with courier logos that worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, and it got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user wanted to prevent people from knocking because maybe they were busy with the baby and didn't want interruptions. So they used signs that said \"Do not knock\" for packages. But when they ordered food, the same sign made the delivery person leave it at the door instead of knocking to get the user's attention. The food got cold because they didn't check the door, and now they're upset about that.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole here. The husband says they asked for it. The user thinks common sense should have prevailed. So, the key points are: the user's intent was to prevent knocking for packages, but food delivery is different. The sign was specific to courier logos, which might have confused the delivery person into thinking all deliveries should be left at the door, not just packages.\n\nIs the user at fault? Well, they wanted to avoid knocking, but food delivery usually requires timely service. By using a sign that's for packages, maybe they didn't clearly indicate that food should be handled differently. The delivery person might not have realized that the \"Do not knock\" applied only to packages, not food. The user might have assumed the sign was clear, but it wasn't specific enough. So, maybe the user is responsible for not making their instructions clear enough for food versus packages. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense and knocked despite the sign, but maybe that's expecting too much.\n\nAnother angle: the user's sign might have been misunderstood. If the sign only had courier logos, perhaps it was intended for package deliveries, not food orders. The user might not have realized that food delivery services (like DoorDash, Uber Eats) might interpret the sign differently. So, the user's mistake was not differentiating between package and food delivery instructions. They expected the delivery person to knock, but the sign said not to, leading to the cold food.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is a new mom dealing with a lot, and maybe the sign was meant to minimize interruptions. They did specify \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes before, but it didn't work. So, maybe they had a valid reason to put up the sign. However, by using a sign that's for courier packages, they might have inadvertently applied the same rule to food deliveries. That's where the problem came in. The user didn't specify that food should be handled differently, so the delivery person followed the sign.\n\nSo, is the user at fault? They might be partially at fault for not making clear that food should be knocked on. The delivery person might not have known. But the delivery person could have used common sense to check if the recipient was home. Maybe both sides have a point. However, the user's sign led to the situation. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they didn't specify the exception for food, leading to the cold meal. Alternatively, if the sign was too generic, maybe the delivery person shouldn't have followed it for food. But the user's sign was about not knocking, so if the delivery person left it at the door to avoid knocking, maybe they followed the instructions properly. The user expected the delivery person to knock despite the sign, which the sign explicitly says not to. So, the user is in the wrong because they gave conflicting instructions, leading to the problem.\n"
