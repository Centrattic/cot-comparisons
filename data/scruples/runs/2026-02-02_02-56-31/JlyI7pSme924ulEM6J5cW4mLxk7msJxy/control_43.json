I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for expecting the delivery person not to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been having packages delivered and consistently told the delivery people not to knock. She used signs and written notes, but they kept knocking. Then she put up a more visible sign with company logos, which worked\u2014delivery people stopped knocking. But when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left the food at the door, which got cold. The husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was to prevent knocking for packages, which she communicated clearly. The sign worked for that purpose. The issue arises when the same sign caused the food delivery person to not knock, leading to a cold meal. The key points here are whether the sign was too broad, and if the delivery person should have used judgment despite the sign.\n\nThe sign has images of courier logos and says \"Do not knock. Please leave at the door.\" It's possible the food delivery person followed the sign literally, not realizing it's for packages only. The author might not have specified that the sign applies to packages, not food. However, she did mention in her notes that she wanted food deliveries to be handled without knocking as well. The husband's comment suggests he thinks they were responsible for the sign leading to the problem. \n\nThe delivery person's job is to follow instructions given by the customer, which in this case was the sign. If the sign was clear, they might not be at fault. The author's problem is that the sign worked as intended but caused an unintended consequence when applied to food. The question is whether the author should have anticipated that a food delivery might need knocking to prevent the food from getting cold. The author might not be in the wrong because she followed the delivery instructions, but she could have clarified that the sign applies only to packages. However, since she did mention \"food deliverer\" in the note, maybe she's responsible for not specifying exceptions. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense to knock despite the sign. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's main issue was not considering that food delivery might require knocking. She set up the sign to prevent knocking for non-food packages but didn't account for food deliveries. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not clarifying the sign's scope. But the delivery person strictly followed the written instruction without using judgment. The question is whether the sign was too vague. If the sign said \"For packages only,\" the problem wouldn't have happened. So, the author's fault is in not specifying the sign's applicability, making her at least partially in the wrong. However, the delivery person's strict adherence could also be a factor. \n\nGiven that she did write \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes for food as well, maybe she's not entirely wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but the delivery person's responsibility is to follow the given instructions. If the instructions were clear, they are following procedures. The problem is the sign's lack of specificity. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for not clarifying the sign's intended use. Hence, answer A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
