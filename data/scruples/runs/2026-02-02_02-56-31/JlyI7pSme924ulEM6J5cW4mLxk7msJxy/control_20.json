I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. They tried multiple times to tell delivery people not to knock by using handwritten signs and notes in the delivery instructions. But those were ignored. So they made a sign with the courier logos, which worked but caused an issue. When they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock, left it at the door, and it got cold. The husband said they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are the signs and the delivery person's actions. The author made clear instructions not to knock, but the delivery person followed the sign's instructions literally, leading to a problem. The problem is that the food was left outside and got cold. \n\nThe author's intention was to avoid disturbances as a new mom, which is understandable. However, the sign with courier logos might have been interpreted in a way that the delivery person didn't realize that certain items (like food) require different handling. The sign probably said not to knock for packages, but didn't specify that food deliveries are exceptions. \n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not clarifying that food deliveries are an exception. However, the delivery person also might be at fault for not using common sense and leaving food outside in a way that it got cold. The question is whether the author's instructions were too strict without considering different types of deliveries.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author tried multiple times to communicate their preference, but the delivery person still didn't knock. The sign was effective for packages but not for food. The author might have expected the delivery person to use judgment, but maybe the sign was too rigid. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person's job is to follow instructions, and if the sign explicitly says not to knock, they might be following protocol. However, leaving food outside without ensuring it stays warm could be a breach of their duty. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. The author might share some responsibility for not accounting for different delivery types, but the delivery person also didn't use discretion. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks the author is at fault. But the author's frustration is valid because the sign worked for packages but not for food. \n\nOverall, the author's intention was valid, but the method might have been flawed. However, since the delivery person also didn't handle the food properly, the blame isn't solely on the author. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the main issue was the sign leading to the problem, maybe the answer is A (Yes), but I'm a bit torn because the delivery person also made a mistake.\n"
