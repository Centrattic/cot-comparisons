I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a new mom who's had a lot of packages delivered. She's been putting up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent the delivery people from knocking on her door, maybe because the baby is sleeping or she's busy. She tried different versions of the sign and even wrote notes in the delivery options, but they kept knocking. Then she found a new sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages, but when she ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left it outside where it got cold.\n\nSo the question is, is she the asshole for expecting the food deliverer to knock? Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From her perspective, she's a new mom trying to manage deliveries without disturbance. She's taken steps to communicate her preference clearly, which worked for packages. The problem is that when the food came, the delivery person followed the same sign, leading to a cold meal. She probably wanted the food delivered in a timely manner but also didn't want to be disturbed. However, food delivery is different from packages. Packages can be left outside, but food is time-sensitive and needs to be kept warm. The delivery person probably assumed that if the sign said not to knock, they should leave it at the door, which is standard practice for packages. But in this case, that led to a bad outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have considered that the food delivery might require a different approach. The sign was for corporate couriers, maybe not for food delivery apps. The delivery person might not have checked the sign if they're using a different service or if the sign's context was only for packages. Also, common sense would suggest that if the food is hot, the delivery person should knock to ensure it's delivered while it's still warm. The user expects the delivery person to use judgment, but the delivery person followed the instructions literally without considering the nature of the item.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She communicated her preference clearly, but maybe the sign wasn't specific enough. However, food delivery is a different scenario. She might have assumed that the delivery person would adapt, but the delivery person followed the sign's instructions strictly. It's a bit of a misunderstanding. The user isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs, but maybe she didn't consider that the sign might not apply to food deliveries. However, the delivery person also didn't use common sense. So perhaps it's a mix, but not entirely her fault. The answer would be B (No), as she's not the asshole, but there's room for both sides.\n"
