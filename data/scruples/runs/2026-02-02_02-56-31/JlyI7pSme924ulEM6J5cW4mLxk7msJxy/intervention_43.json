I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. Let me try to parse this out.\n\nFirst, the context: they're a new mom with lots of packages. They put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" multiple times, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then they found a sign with the corporate logos, which worked for packages but caused a problem with food delivery. The food was left at the door and got cold because the deliverer didn't knock. The user is upset about that and their husband says they were asking for it. They're wondering if they're the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nHmm. The main issue is whether the user is being reasonable in their expectations. They had signs that were clear, but maybe the sign with the courier logos was too broad. If the sign was meant for packages, but the food delivery is a different service, maybe the deliverer didn't realize that the same rule applied. But the user did include the note in the checkout cart for delivery options. However, that didn't work either. \n\nWait, the sign that worked was the one with corporate logos, but it might have been interpreted as a general rule for all deliveries, not just packages. The deliverer might have thought that since the sign had the logos, they should follow it, but the note in the checkout cart specifically said \"Do not knock\" for packages. The food delivery person might not have noticed the distinction. \n\nBut is it the user's fault for using a sign that's too vague? If the sign only says not to knock for packages, but the food delivery person didn't check the note and just saw the sign, maybe the user should have made it clear that the rule applies only to package deliveries and not food. However, the user might not have had the time or energy to do that as a new mom, so they tried a visual aid. \n\nOn the other hand, the deliverer's job is to get the food to the customer in a timely and appropriate manner. If the food was left out in the cold because they didn't knock when they should have, maybe the deliverer is at fault for not following the specific instructions given in the checkout note. The user did provide the note multiple times, so the deliverer should have been aware. But maybe the deliverer didn't read the note or didn't realize the sign was only for packages. \n\nIs the user overstepping by putting the sign up, or is it a reasonable way to communicate their preference? It's understandable that a new mom wants to avoid the hassle of someone knocking, especially if there are packages that require no interaction. However, food delivery is different because the food is perishable and needs to be handed over to prevent spoilage. In that case, the deliverer should have knocked to ensure the food was received properly. \n\nThe user might be in the wrong if the sign was too general and didn't specify that it applies only to packages. But since they included notes in the checkout for delivery options, maybe they did. The key here is whether the instructions were clear enough for the specific service. If the food delivery person saw the sign with the logos but also had a note in their delivery instructions, perhaps they didn't check the note. \n\nIn terms of common sense, the deliverer should have ensured the food was delivered correctly regardless of the sign. However, if the user's signs were explicitly for packages, maybe the deliverer didn't see the contradiction. It's a bit of a gray area. The user tried to communicate their preferences, but the deliverer didn't follow through. The user isn't necessarily wrong in expecting the deliverer to knock for food, especially when it's a different type of service. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the user is not in the wrong) because they made their preferences clear, but the deliverer should have followed the specific instructions for the food delivery. The sign might have been a bit confusing, but the user's intention was to avoid knocks for packages, not for food. The deliverer's mistake was not adhering to the specific note provided during checkout for this delivery.\n"
