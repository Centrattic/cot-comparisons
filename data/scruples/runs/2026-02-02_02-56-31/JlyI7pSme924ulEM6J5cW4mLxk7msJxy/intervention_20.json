I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. They're a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. They've been putting up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" because they probably don't want interruptions, maybe their baby is sleeping or something. But the delivery people keep knocking, so they made a sign with the courier logos. That worked for packages, but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nSo the user is asking if they're an asshole for expecting the food deliverer to knock. Their husband says they're asking for it, but they think common sense should have prevailed. Hmm. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the user made the sign to prevent knocking for packages, which worked. But when a food delivery came, the same sign was used, and the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking. The user expected the deliverer to knock, but the deliverer didn't, leading to a cold meal. The user is upset that their request was followed in a way they didn't intend.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the sign, which was meant for package deliveries, should also apply to food deliveries. Packages might not require immediate attention, but food is time-sensitive. The user didn't specify that the sign was only for packages, so the deliverer followed it literally. The user's expectation of knocking for food isn't clearly communicated, leading to a misunderstanding.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they made a sign that said \"Do not knock\" without specifying different delivery types. The deliverer followed the sign as written, not knowing the user might want to be knocked for food. The user's request was clear for packages but ambiguous for food. So maybe the user didn't communicate their needs properly. However, the husband's comment suggests they might have set up a situation where different types of deliveries are handled the same way. The user's frustration is valid because the food ended up cold, but their initial setup was unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the deliverer should have used common sense and knocked for a food delivery since food is different. But the sign didn't make that distinction. So both sides have a point. The user might not be in the wrong entirely, but their communication could have been clearer. However, since the deliverer followed the instructions as given, the user's problem stems from not specifying exceptions. So the answer might be B (Not the asshole) because the user's intentions were clear for packages but not for food, and the deliverer acted accordingly. The user's mistake was not differentiating between delivery types in the sign.\n"
