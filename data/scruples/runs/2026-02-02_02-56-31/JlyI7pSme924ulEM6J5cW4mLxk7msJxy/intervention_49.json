I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So the situation is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. She's put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" multiple times, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then she found a new sign with the corporate logos, and that worked\u2014delivery people stopped knocking. But then, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking. The food was ice cold, and the user is upset about that. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user had a problem with delivery people knocking, which she found annoying, especially as a new mom. She tried various ways to communicate \"Do not knock,\" including handwritten signs and notes in checkout. But they were ignored. So she changed the sign to include the courier logos, which made the delivery people comply and not knock. However, in this specific case, the food delivery was left outside, leading to a cold meal. The user is upset because she expected the delivery person to use some common sense, like not leaving perishable food outside in the cold. But the delivery person followed the sign literally, not knocking, but didn't take into account the nature of the item (food that needs to be delivered warm).\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nTo determine this, I need to consider the expectations of both parties. The user clearly communicated her preference not to be knocked on. She had a valid reason, being a new mom, so she likely wanted to avoid disturbances. However, by putting up a sign that strictly prohibits knocking, she might have made an absolute rule that doesn't account for exceptions. For example, food deliveries typically require the recipient to be present to receive them, and leaving food outside could risk it getting cold or stolen. \n\nIn this case, the delivery person followed the sign's instruction (do not knock), but in doing so, left the food unattended. The user might argue that the delivery person should have used better judgment, but the delivery person might have been just following the explicit instructions given on the sign. There's a conflict here between the user's desire to not be disturbed and the practical needs of receiving certain types of deliveries. \n\nHowever, the user did have a history of issues with being knocked on, leading her to take stronger measures. The problem arises because the solution (the new sign) worked too well, causing an unintended consequence. The user is upset because she expected the delivery person to recognize that food shouldn't be left outside, but the sign didn't account for that nuance. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It depends on whose perspective you take. The user set clear instructions, but perhaps didn't consider that the sign might lead to other issues. On the other hand, the delivery person followed the instructions literally, not considering the type of item. \n\nIn similar situations, people often debate whether following explicit rules is better than using common sense. Here, the user might be seen as overcompensating by creating a rule that's too strict, not considering the different types of deliveries. However, she had a legitimate reason to not want to be disturbed. The delivery person's job is to follow instructions, but also to exercise judgment when necessary. \n\nIn the end, maybe the user isn't entirely in the wrong because her intention was to avoid disturbances. However, she could have found a more nuanced solution, like specifying that packages are okay to leave but food needs to be delivered with a knock. Since she didn't do that, the strict sign might have caused an unintended problem. But it's a tricky situation where both parties have valid points. \n\nI think the answer here might lean towards \"No, you're not in the wrong\" (B), because the user had a valid reason and tried to communicate her preference clearly. However, the delivery person might be at fault for not using judgment in a food delivery scenario. But the user could also be blamed for not considering that food needs to be handled differently. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nLooking at similar AITA threads, sometimes people are criticized for creating rules that are too strict and not accounting for exceptions. In this case, the sign worked for packages but not for food. The user might have been too rigid in her instructions, leading to an unintended consequence. Therefore, she might share some responsibility. But again, her intention was to avoid being disturbed. \n\nBalancing all this, I'm leaning towards B (No) because the user's intention was valid, and the delivery person's mistake was in not using common sense. However, the user could have adjusted her sign to allow exceptions. But since she didn't, maybe she's partially at fault. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the sign was the user's fault for being too strict, then A. If the delivery person is at fault for following the sign too literally, then B. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is B (No), the user isn't in the wrong. The delivery person should have used better judgment, even with the sign. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the sign's wording was too absolute. If it said \"Do not knock for packages,\" then it would make more sense. But the user used a sign with logos that might have been misinterpreted. So, maybe the user is partially at fault for not being clear. However, the main issue is the delivery person not using common sense. \n\nIn the end, the user is justified in her frustration because the delivery person left food outside, which is a different scenario. So the answer is B.\n"
