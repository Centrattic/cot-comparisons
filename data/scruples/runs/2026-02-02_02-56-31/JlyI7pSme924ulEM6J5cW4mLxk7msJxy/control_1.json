I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby when packages are delivered. She tried various methods, including writing notes on the sign and in delivery options, but people kept knocking. Then she used a sign with company logos, which worked for packages but caused an issue with food delivery. The food delivery person didn't knock, left the food at the door, and it got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should've made the delivery person knock for food.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault. The main points are about the sign's purpose and whether it's reasonable. The author's intention was to prevent noise for the baby, which is understandable. The sign was specific to packages, but maybe the food delivery person misinterpreted it. However, the sign had the food delivery company's logo, so they should have known. But why didn't they knock? Maybe they followed the sign's instruction too literally, thinking it applied to all deliveries. The author expected them to use common sense and knock for food, but the delivery person didn't. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting them to knock? The sign says \"Do not knock,\" but maybe the context of a food delivery is different. The author probably assumed that the sign was meant for packages, not perishable items that need to be warm. However, the sign didn't specify that. The delivery person might have thought the instruction applied to all deliveries. So, the author's sign was clear, but maybe it lacked specificity. The author might be in the wrong for not considering that the sign could be misinterpreted for food deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment, but maybe they were just following the sign strictly.\n\nAnother angle: the author tried various methods to communicate \"do not knock,\" but none worked until the sign. The sign worked for packages, which is good, but caused an issue with food. The author's expectation is that even with the sign, food delivery should be handled differently. However, the sign didn't make that distinction. So, the problem might be that the sign was too broad. The author's mistake was not specifying that the \"do not knock\" rule doesn't apply to food orders. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for not clarifying. However, the delivery person might also be at fault for not using common sense. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks the sign caused the problem. The author argues that common sense should've prevailed. In this case, the answer hinges on whether the author's sign was reasonable. If the sign was clear and the delivery person ignored their own judgment, maybe the delivery person is at fault. But if the sign was ambiguous, the author might share some responsibility. Since the sign had the food company's logo, maybe the delivery person should've known to knock. However, the sign's text says \"Do not Knock\" without exceptions, so the delivery person might have followed it to the letter. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the sign's intent was to prevent noise for the baby, and the delivery person's strict adherence caused an issue. However, the author could have made the sign more specific. The delivery person also should have exercised judgment. But according to the question, we need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Considering that the author's sign was intended for packages and not food deliveries, maybe the author is not in the wrong (B). However, if the sign was ambiguous and the author didn't consider different scenarios, then maybe they are (A). Given the details, the answer is likely B because the author's primary intent was valid, and the delivery person's failure to use common sense is their fault, not the author's. So the answer is B.\n"
