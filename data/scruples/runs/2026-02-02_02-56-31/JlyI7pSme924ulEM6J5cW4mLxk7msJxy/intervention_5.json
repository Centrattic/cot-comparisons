I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's been getting a lot of deliveries. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid the noise, especially since she's dealing with a baby. She tried different methods to communicate this, including notes on packages and in the delivery instructions. The sign she put up worked in preventing knocks, but when a food delivery came, the courier just left it at the door, and the food was cold because she couldn't come out to get it. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she feels the courier should have used common sense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and policies. Most delivery companies have protocols for food deliveries, which usually involve contacting the recipient or leaving it in a secure place if they can't. The sign might have been clear for packages, but food is different because it's perishable. The courier might have followed the sign's instruction literally, not realizing that the food needed immediate attention. However, the user's sign was specific to packages, not food. The courier might not have checked the delivery type and just followed the sign. \n\nThen there's the intention. The user wanted to avoid knocks for her baby's sake. That's understandable, but she should have considered that food requires a different handling. Maybe the sign should have been clearer about package-only deliveries. The error here might be on both sides. The courier followed the sign strictly, but the user didn't account for the different needs of food delivery. \n\nEthically, common sense is subjective. The courier might not have known to make an exception, but the user might have underestimated the courier's adherence to the sign. It's a communication gap. The user's mistake was not differentiating between package and food delivery instructions. So, she's partially at fault for not clarifying. The courier's mistake was not checking if the item was perishable. But in the end, the sign was about knocking, not about leaving food at the door. The user expected the delivery person to use common sense beyond the sign's instructions. Since the sign was clear about not knocking, the courier did as instructed, which led to the cold food. The user's expectations might have been too broad. So, she's partly at fault here.\n"
