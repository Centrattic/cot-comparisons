I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" for packages. She used handwritten signs and wrote the note in delivery options each time, but the delivery people kept knocking. So she got a sign with corporate logos to get their attention, which worked for packages, but when she ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left the food at the door, which got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions of the author. Her main goal was to prevent delivery people from knocking, probably to avoid disturbing her newborn. She tried multiple methods to communicate this, which shows she made an effort. The problem arose when the food delivery followed the same rules as package deliveries. However, food delivery might require a different approach because perishable items need to be handed over quickly to prevent spoilage.\n\nThe key points here are the effectiveness of the sign. The sign worked for packages, but food delivery is time-sensitive. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock, leading to the food being left out and getting cold. The author's husband thinks they asked for it, implying that using the same sign for food was an oversight.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. She intended to stop knocking for packages, not realizing that food delivery might not adhere to the same rules. However, by using a sign that includes all couriers, regardless of the item type, she might have been responsible for the misunderstanding. Did she consider that food delivery requires immediate handoff? The sign doesn't differentiate between package and food deliveries, which could be a flaw in her approach.\n\nBut on the other hand, she tried multiple times to communicate her preference for no knocking. The delivery person didn't check if the sign applied to food, which might be their responsibility. However, the author didn't specify on the sign that it applies to packages only. So there's a mutual misunderstanding here. The author didn't make the exception clear, and the delivery person didn't question the sign's applicability to food.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some blame. The author didn't specify that the sign is for packages only, and the delivery person didn't verify. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she created the sign to prevent knocking, which led to an unintended consequence, she might be partially at fault for not clarifying the scope. However, the delivery person also has a duty to ensure food is delivered properly, which might require knocking instead of leaving it out.\n\nConsidering common sense, maybe the author should have realized that food delivery is different and adjusted her sign accordingly. But as a new mom, she might not have considered that aspect. The husband's comment suggests that using the same sign for food was the issue. So, the answer depends on whether the author was negligent in not specifying the sign's application. Since the sign doesn't mention food, the author might share some responsibility, making her the asshole. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment. But in AITA scenarios, often the person who created the situation is held accountable if they didn't account for all scenarios. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because the sign's broad application caused the problem, and she didn't consider the different needs for food deliveries.\n"
