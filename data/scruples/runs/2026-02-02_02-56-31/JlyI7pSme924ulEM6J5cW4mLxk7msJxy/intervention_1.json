I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a new mom who's had a lot of package deliveries. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want the delivery people knocking on her door, maybe to avoid disturbing her baby or something. She tried different ways to communicate this, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then she got a sign that worked\u2014delivery people stopped knocking. But when someone delivered food, they left it at the door even though it was ice cold, and the meal was late. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the intent of her sign. It said not to knock, but maybe didn't cover leaving items at the door. So the delivery person might have interpreted the sign as, \"Don't knock, just leave it here,\" which is why they left the food outside. But the food was supposed to be hot, so leaving it in the cold made it bad. \n\nShe expects the delivery person to use common sense, like not leaving perishable items outside when it's icy. But maybe the sign didn't specify that. The sign's purpose was to prevent knocking, not to handle all delivery scenarios. So the delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally but didn't consider the context of the food needing to be kept warm. \n\nOn the other hand, she had a history of package issues, so maybe she should have included more specific instructions for food deliveries. But she wrote \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes too. The problem is that the sign worked too well, leading to an unintended consequence. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks the sign was too rigid. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she communicated her request not to knock, which is reasonable. But perhaps she didn't consider that food deliveries require different handling. The delivery person followed the instruction but didn't account for the food's temperature. So maybe she's not entirely at fault, but maybe she could have been more specific. However, the sign didn't mention food, so it's on the deliverer to adjust for perishables. It's a bit of a gray area. But generally, signs like that are for packages, not food. So maybe she's not the asshole here. The answer might be B (No), but it's close.\n"
