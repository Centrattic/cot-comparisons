It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation involves a political argument where they usually avoid discussing their differences. This time, the husband started yelling and mocking her, leading her to punch him. He left and she hasn't seen him since. She later edited her post to say she realizes she was wrong and will apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Physical violence in any relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking, hitting him with a closed fist to the face is an aggressive act that can cause harm. While it's clear that the argument was heated and both might have contributed to the escalation, the use of physical force crosses a line. The author's edit shows she acknowledges her mistake, which is a positive step, but the initial action still needs to be evaluated.\n\nThe husband's actions (yelling, mocking) are not justifiable, but they don't excuse the physical response. In many contexts, using physical violence in response to verbal arguments is considered wrong because it can lead to further escalation and harm. The fact that there's a bruise indicates that there was actual physical impact, which might have legal implications depending on the jurisdiction. However, the question here is more about moral wrongdoing rather than legal consequences.\n\nThe mention of a troll account pretending to be the husband adds a layer of complexity, but it doesn't change the original action. The author's intention in the original post was to seek validation on whether she was in the wrong. Her follow-up edit shows self-awareness, but the initial act remains. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the consensus would likely be that the author is in the wrong for using physical violence, even if provoked. While the husband's behavior was inappropriate, physical retaliation isn't the solution. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
