It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. \n\nFirst, the situation: political argument between spouses, differing views on abortion. The husband started yelling and mocking her, leading her to hit him with a closed fist. He left and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nNow, the key points. Physical violence in a relationship is generally wrong, even if provoked. Even though he was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him is a form of physical aggression. The fact that she mentions it was her first time doing something like this and she plans to apologize shows she recognizes it was a mistake. \n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. In most contexts, using physical force against a spouse, regardless of the provocation, is considered wrong. It can escalate conflicts and cause harm. However, some might argue that self-defense or defense of dignity could be a factor, but in this case, the husband's actions (yelling and mocking) might not rise to the level of immediate threat requiring physical retaliation. \n\nAlso, the edit where she admits she was wrong reinforces that she acknowledges her mistake. The original question is a classic \"Am I the asshole?\" scenario, where the poster is seeking validation but already has some self-awareness.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because physical violence is not the appropriate response, even in heated arguments. However, the context of the argument and the fact that it was a first-time incident might mitigate the severity, but the act itself is still wrong.\n"
