It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a big argument where he starts yelling and mocking her, and she hits him in a rage. Then he leaves and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her action of hitting him is wrong. Physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it's abusive and can cause harm. Even if there's provocation, like yelling and mockery, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a clear act of physical aggression. \n\nThe husband's behavior isn't excusable either. Yelling and mocking are disrespectful and can escalate conflicts, but that doesn't justify a physical response. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. She admits she was wrong in her edit, which shows some self-awareness. But the initial action is still violent. \n\nEven if the argument was heated, hitting someone is a step beyond verbal conflict. The consequences, like the bruise and him driving off, indicate that the action had real impact. The author also mentions it was the first time, but that doesn't make it right. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for using physical violence, even if provoked. It's important to address conflicts without resorting to harm. The husband's actions were inconsiderate too, but the physical assault is a more severe issue. The fact that she plans to apologize is good but doesn't negate the initial wrong.\n"
