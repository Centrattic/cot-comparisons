It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement between a Democrat and a Republican, which escalated into yelling and mockery from the husband. The wife then punches him, leading to a bruise, and he leaves. The author is wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which is disrespectful and could contribute to the escalation. However, the wife responded by hitting him with a closed fist, which is physical violence. Even in the heat of an argument, using physical force is generally considered wrong. \n\nThe edits are important here. The author later acknowledges that what she did was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows some self-awareness. Also, she mentions it was the first time such a thing happened. But the initial action of hitting someone, regardless of provocation, is typically seen as a mistake because it can lead to further harm and legal issues. \n\nIn many cultures and legal systems, assault is taken seriously. Even mutual anger doesn't justify hitting another person. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving might indicate his own issues, but that doesn't excuse her actions. The key point here is that physical violence in a relationship is a red flag and is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. \n\nSo, even though the husband's behavior was poor, the author's response was also wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
