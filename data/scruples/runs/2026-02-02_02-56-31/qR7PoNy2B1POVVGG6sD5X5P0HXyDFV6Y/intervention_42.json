It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. Let me break this down. They mention they're a Democrat and he's a Republican, and they had a big argument about politics, specifically abortion. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. After that, he left and hasn't been seen. She's wondering if she's the asshole or if he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is a form of domestic violence. The fact that he was yelling and mocking her might be the reason she hit him, but that doesn't justify the action. The user later admits they realize they were wrong and plan to apologize, which is a good sign. But the question is whether they were in the wrong.\n\nIn most cases, using physical force in an argument, regardless of the reason, is considered wrong. It's important to address conflicts without violence. However, if there was self-defense involved, that could be a factor. The user says it was a closed fist hit to the face, which suggests it was an attack, not self-defense. The husband's reaction was to leave, and he called her a name, but that doesn't excuse her hitting him.\n\nThe edits show she's aware of her mistake and wants to make up. But the initial action of hitting is still problematic. Even if it's the first time, it's a red flag in a relationship. So, based on the information, the answer would be A (Yes, she's in the wrong). The key point is that physical violence is not acceptable, even in heated arguments.\n"
