It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument about politics. The argument started with them having different opinions on abortion, which escalated to him yelling and mocking her. In her rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Now he's gone, and she's wondering if she's the asshole or if he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, physical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of the situation. Even in heated arguments, resorting to hitting someone crosses a line. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face is significant because it's intentional and could cause harm. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and driving off might indicate his own inappropriate behavior, but that doesn't justify her action.\n\nThe user's edit shows she acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize, which is positive. However, the initial act of hitting is a serious issue. Relationships require communication and non-violent conflict resolution. Even if the argument was intense, using physical force is not a solution and can cause lasting damage to the relationship.\n\nAlso, the mention of a troll account pretending to be her husband might be a red herring or an attempt to shift focus, but it's not relevant to whether her action was wrong. The key points are her physical aggression and the context of the argument. While the husband's yelling and mocking were uncalled for, that doesn't excuse her hitting him. Both parties have a responsibility to handle conflicts without violence.\n\nIn conclusion, even if there were provocation, using physical force is wrong. The author's action is inexcusable, and she's definitely in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
