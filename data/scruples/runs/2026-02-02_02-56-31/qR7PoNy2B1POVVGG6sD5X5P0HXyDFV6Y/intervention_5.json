It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if she was wrong to hit her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement about abortion, leading to yelling, mocking, and then her hitting him with a closed fist. He left after that, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She admits she hit him, which is physical violence. Even if provoked, using physical force is generally not acceptable. He was yelling and mocking, which is emotional abuse, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. She says it was the first time and she plans to apologize, which shows she acknowledges the mistake.\n\nIn relationships, using physical violence is a serious issue. While both sides have responsibilities to communicate without escalating, the act of hitting is a clear wrong. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) is bad too, but it doesn't make her action right. The fact that she hit him led to him leaving, and now she's concerned about being the asshole. \n\nThe edits also show she's taking responsibility now, which is positive. The troll edit at the end might be a red herring. So, even though there's context of the argument, the answer is that she was wrong to hit him. So answer A.\n"
