It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation is that they had a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him in a rage. Now, he left and she hasn't seen him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. In any conflict, physical violence is a big red flag. Even if there's provocation, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. But there's context here: he was yelling and mocking her. That could be seen as a trigger for her to hit back. However, it's important to note that mutual escalation doesn't justify physical aggression. Most domestic violence guidelines would say that using physical force in an argument, regardless of the reason, is not acceptable. \n\nThe author admits she was wrong in the edit, which shows she's aware of the mistake. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer here would likely be A (yes), because hitting someone is a violation of their physical safety and trust. Even in heated arguments, physical aggression is generally considered the wrong response. The husband's yelling and mocking, while inconsiderate, doesn't give her the right to hit him. There are healthier ways to handle conflict, like taking a break or seeking counseling. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's making an apology shows she recognizes the error, but the act itself is still wrong. The husband's behavior isn't excused either, but the question is about the author's actions. So the answer is A.\n"
