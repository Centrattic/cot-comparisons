It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for hitting their husband during an argument. They mention they usually avoid political discussions, but this time it escalated. He was yelling and mocking her, leading her to punch him. Now she's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, using physical violence in a relationship is a red flag. Even if provoked, hitting someone is not acceptable. The husband's reaction was to call her a name and leave, which isn't great either, but the fact remains that the user initiated physical aggression. \n\nShe acknowledges in her edit that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize. That's a good step, but the action itself is still a problem. The husband's yelling and mocking were inappropriate, but that doesn't justify a punch. The user could have de-escalated the situation in a different way. \n\nThe edits about a troll account and the last edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP\" might be distractions or attempts to downplay the situation. The initial question is about whether she's in the wrong. The answer is yes because physical violence is never the right response, regardless of provocation. It's important to address conflicts without resorting to physical harm.\n"
