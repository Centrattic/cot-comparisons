It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement, he yelled and mocked her, and in a fit of rage she hit him. He then left and there's a bruise. She's considering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, physical violence is generally not acceptable in a relationship. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a form of assault. While the husband's yelling and mocking might have been the trigger, that doesn't justify the response. The user acknowledges in an edit that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize. However, the act itself is wrong regardless of the reason. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face and caused a bruise adds to the severity. The husband's reaction of leaving and calling her a name is also problematic, but the key point is whether the user is at fault. Since physical aggression is not acceptable, the answer is likely A. Also, the user's edit about a troll account doesn't change the fact that she hit him. So the answer should be A.\n"
