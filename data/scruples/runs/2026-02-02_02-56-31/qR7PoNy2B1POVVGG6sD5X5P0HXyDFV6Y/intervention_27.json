It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a political argument with their husband about abortion. The husband is Republican, they're Democrat. They usually ignore their political differences, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist to the face. Then he left and came back with a bruise, called her a bitch, and drove off. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. She admitted that she hit him. Physical violence is a big deal in a relationship. Even if the husband was being an asshole by yelling and mocking her, using physical aggression is generally considered wrong. It's a cycle that can escalate, and even the first time can have serious consequences. \n\nBut the husband's behavior is also a factor. He was yelling and being disrespectful, which isn't okay either. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Even if he provoked her, hitting someone is a criminal act in many places and can lead to legal issues. Emotionally, it's important to address the fact that physical violence is not an acceptable way to resolve conflicts. \n\nShe also mentioned in the edit that she realizes her mistake and wants to apologize. That shows some self-awareness. But the act itself is still a problem. The fact that he left and she hasn't seen him since suggests that there might be lasting damage to the relationship even if she apologizes.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of mutual respect in a relationship. Both partners should be able to express their views without resorting to name-calling or physical harm. However, initiating physical violence is a clear breach of that respect. Even in the heat of the moment, it's considered a mistake that should be addressed and apologized for, but it's still an action that can't be ignored.\n\nThe part where she says he might be being a baby could indicate she doesn't fully take responsibility, but in her edit, she does acknowledge that she was wrong. That might be the case where she's trying to understand both sides but knows she made a mistake.\n\nSo, considering all this, even if there was provocation, using physical violence is not acceptable. Therefore, the answer would be that she is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
