It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation is a political disagreement, which escalated into yelling and mockery from the husband. The user then hit him with a closed fist, leading to a bruise, and now the husband is gone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Physical violence in a relationship is a big deal. Even if provoked, using physical force is generally not acceptable. The husband was yelling and mocking, which is disrespectful, but hitting someone is a criminal act in many places. The user admits it's their first time doing something like this and plans to apologize. \n\nHowever, regardless of the circumstances, hitting someone is wrong. It's important to resolve conflicts without physical aggression. The husband's response of calling them a \"bitch\" and driving off adds to the tension, but that doesn't justify the physical hit. The user's action crossed a line, even if the argument was heated.\n\nAlso, the user's edits show they're aware they were wrong and want to make up. But the initial question is about being in the wrong. So, the answer would be that yes, they're in the wrong for using physical violence. It's not about who started the argument but about the response. So the answer is A.\n"
