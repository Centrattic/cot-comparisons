It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The context is a political disagreement about abortion, which escalated. The husband was yelling and mocking, then the user hit him. He left and there's a bruise. The user now realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if it's the first time, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is not acceptable. But I should consider the provocation. The husband was yelling and mocking, which might have contributed. However, using violence as a response is not justified. The user later admits they're wrong, which is a good step. The husband's reaction of leaving and calling them a name might indicate his own faults, but that doesn't excuse the hit. Relationships require communication and de-escalation, not physical actions. The user's intention to apologize is positive. The answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because hitting is a clear violation, regardless of the argument's cause.\n"
