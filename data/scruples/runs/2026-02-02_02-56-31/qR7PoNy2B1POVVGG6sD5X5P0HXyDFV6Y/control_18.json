It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The key points here are that the argument was about politics, specifically abortion, and the husband was yelling and mocking her. She hit him in a fit of rage with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left, and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong, regardless of the circumstances. Even if there was provocation, using physical force can escalate conflicts and is often seen as crossing a line. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face is significant. While she claims it was a fit of rage and she's remorseful, the action itself is problematic.\n\nThe husband's behavior of yelling and mocking might have contributed to the situation, but that doesn't justify her response. In many cultures, mutual respect is important, and both parties should avoid escalating arguments to physical violence. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and the act of hitting someone, even in an argument, is typically viewed as a wrong action. The edits show that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, which indicates she acknowledges her wrongdoing.\n\nThere's also the edit about a troll account, but that doesn't change the fact that she admitted to hitting him. The final edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" is probably a joke or a meme, but it's irrelevant to the main issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because physical aggression is not acceptable, even if provoked. She should have de-escalated the situation instead of resorting to violence.\n"
