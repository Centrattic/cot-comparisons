It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. They mention they're a Democrat and he's a Republican, which led to a big argument about abortion. They usually ignore their political differences, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. She's questioning if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if the other person was being abusive or yelling, using physical aggression is generally not acceptable. The fact that he was mocking her and yelling might have been the trigger, but hitting someone is a criminal act in many places and can be considered assault. \n\nShe later edited to say she realizes she was wrong and will apologize. That shows some self-awareness, but the initial question is about whether she's in the wrong. The answer here is likely A. Also, there's an edit about a troll account and a random comment about gamers, which might be irrelevancies or attempts to deflect, but the core issue remains. So, A makes sense because using physical violence is wrong regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was at fault, hitting him isn't justified. The user should seek to resolve this through non-violent means.\n"
