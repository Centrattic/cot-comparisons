It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement leading to yelling, mockery, and then the woman hitting her husband with a closed fist, causing a bruise. The husband then left, and the woman is now questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key elements here. Physical violence in a relationship is generally a serious issue. Even if there was provocation, using physical force, especially a closed fist to the face, is a clear act of aggression. The woman acknowledges her actions in the edit, saying she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize, which suggests she sees the mistake. However, the initial question is whether she's in the wrong regardless of her later reflection.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, hitting someone, regardless of the reason, is considered wrong. It's a form of assault and can escalate conflicts. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, that doesn't justify a physical response. The woman's reaction crossed a line into physical violence, which is a serious matter. The husband's response of leaving and calling her a name doesn't make his actions right, but it's also not a justification for hitting him.\n\nThe edits might show that the woman is taking responsibility, but the original act of hitting is still a problem. The community in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context often looks at whether the action was a direct response to something extreme or if it was an overreaction. In this case, even if the argument was heated, hitting isn't acceptable. So the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A), as physical violence is not justified in this scenario.\n"
