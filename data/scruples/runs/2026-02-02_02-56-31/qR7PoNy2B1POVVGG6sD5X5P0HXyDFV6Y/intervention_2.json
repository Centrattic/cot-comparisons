It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. They mention it started over political differences, specifically abortion, which led to yelling and mocking from the husband. The user then hit him, causing a bruise, and now he's left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. While arguments can get heated, using physical violence is a serious issue. Even if the husband was being disrespectful, hitting someone is a form of domestic violence. The user admits they acted in a fit of rage, which might be a mitigating factor, but it doesn't excuse the action. The husband's response of calling them a \"bitch\" and driving off adds complexity, but his initial behavior (yelling, mocking) could have contributed to the situation. However, physical aggression is a clear violation, regardless of the provocation. The user later realizes their mistake and wants to apologize, which shows remorse. But the act itself is wrong and can set a dangerous precedent. The key point is that violence is never acceptable in a relationship, even if both parties are at fault. The husband's mocking might be inconsiderate, but that doesn't justify hitting. So, the answer should be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
