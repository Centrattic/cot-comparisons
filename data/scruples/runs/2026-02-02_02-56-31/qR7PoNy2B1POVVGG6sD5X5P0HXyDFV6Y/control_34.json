It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with political differences that led to an argument. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in a rage, she hit him. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. She mentions they usually ignore their political differences, but this time the argument escalated. The husband's behavior included yelling and mocking, which can be hurtful and disrespectful. Her response was to hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Then he left, calling her a name.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, physical violence is generally not acceptable in a relationship. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a form of assault. However, the context matters. He was being verbally abusive, which can be a trigger. But the appropriate response, even in anger, shouldn't involve physical harm.\n\nThe edits show that the author later realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That's a positive step, but the initial action is still problematic. The troll account edit might be a red herring or a way to deflect, but the main issue is her physical reaction. \n\nSo, while the husband's behavior contributed to the conflict, the act of hitting him crosses a line. The author is in the wrong for using physical violence, regardless of the provocation. The answer should be A.\n"
