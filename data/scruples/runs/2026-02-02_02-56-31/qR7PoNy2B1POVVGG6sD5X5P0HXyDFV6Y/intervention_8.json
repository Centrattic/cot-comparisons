It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument about politics. They mention that he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the circumstances. Even if provoked, hitting someone can escalate conflicts and cause harm. The user admits it was a fit of rage, which is understandable but not justifying the action. The husband's response of calling her a name and driving off might indicate his own issues in handling the conflict, but that doesn't excuse her hitting him.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. They usually ignore political differences, but this argument got heated. The user's edit shows she realizes her mistake and wants to apologize, which is a good step. However, the fact remains that physical aggression occurred. Even if it was the first time, it's still a serious matter. The husband's behavior of mocking and yelling isn't right either, but that doesn't negate her responsibility for the punch.\n\nAlso, the user's mention of a troll account pretending to be her husband adds a layer of complexity, but that's a separate issue. The main question is about her action. So, while the situation has elements of mutual provocation, the physical act of hitting is typically considered wrong and can have legal or emotional consequences. Therefore, the answer is likely that she is in the wrong.\n"
