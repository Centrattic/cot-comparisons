It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a big argument where the husband yells and mocks her, and she responds by punching him. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. She's questioning if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The husband was yelling and mocking her during the argument. That's disrespectful and could contribute to a tense situation. However, physical violence is never acceptable, regardless of the circumstances. The author used a closed fist to hit him, causing a bruise. Even if provoked, using physical force is a problem because it crosses a line into assault. \n\nThe author later says she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows she acknowledges her mistake. But the initial question is whether she's in the wrong. Domestic violence is a serious issue, and any physical aggression in a relationship is concerning. While the husband's behavior was poor (yelling, mocking, calling her a name), hitting someone is a criminal act and not an appropriate response. \n\nThe edits also mention a troll account and a joke at the end, which might indicate the post isn't entirely serious, but the main question about being in the wrong is real. The key point is that physical violence is not justified, regardless of the provocation. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Even if the husband acted poorly, hitting him was the wrong action.\n"
