It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to an argument where the husband yells and mocks, and the wife hits him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. The husband then leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both sides have responsibilities in a relationship. The husband was yelling and mocking, which is disrespectful. The wife, in a rage, hit him. Even if provoked, using physical violence is generally not acceptable. The fact that it was a closed fist hit to the face and resulted in a bruise is significant. \n\nThe user says they realize they were wrong and plan to apologize. That's important because acknowledging the mistake is a step toward resolution. However, the initial action of hitting someone, regardless of provocation, is a form of domestic violence. Even if the husband's behavior was inappropriate, the response of hitting him escalates the situation dangerously.\n\nAlso, domestic violence is a serious issue, and the law typically doesn't excuse it, even if there's mutual provocation. The wife's action could have serious consequences, like legal repercussions or damage to the relationship. It's important to note that while the husband's behavior was inconsiderate, it doesn't justify the wife's physical response. \n\nThe edits show she's taking responsibility now, but the initial act is still wrong. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and leaving adds complexity, but again, that doesn't justify her hitting him. The key here is that physical violence is not an appropriate response to an argument, no matter the provocation. So, the answer is A; the author is in the wrong.\n"
