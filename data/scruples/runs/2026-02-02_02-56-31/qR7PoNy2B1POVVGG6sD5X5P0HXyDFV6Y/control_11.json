It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement, he was yelling and mocking her, and in a rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left and hasn't returned. The author is questioning if she's the asshole or if he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. While the husband's yelling and mocking might have escalated the situation, using physical violence is generally not acceptable. Even in the heat of an argument, hitting someone, especially with a closed fist leading to a bruise, is considered assault. There's a clear line between verbal arguments and physical aggression. The author acknowledges this later in the edit, saying she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, which suggests she now understands it was wrong.\n\nAnother point is that domestic violence is a serious issue, and any physical altercation between partners is a red flag regardless of the provocation. The husband's reaction of leaving might indicate he felt the situation was too volatile, which is a valid safety measure. The author's initial justification of \"he started it\" doesn't excuse the physical violence. \n\nAlso, the part where she says \"he called me a bitch\" after she hit him\u2014it's possible he was reacting to being hit, but that still doesn't justify his name-calling. However, the focus here is on the author's action of hitting him first. \n\nThe edits also mention a troll account and a controversial phrase (\"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\"), which might be distractions or attempts to provoke, but the main issue remains the physical assault. \n\nIn conclusion, even if the husband had been provocative, the author's use of physical violence was wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
