It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement between a Democrat and a Republican, which escalated into yelling and mocking. The woman then hit her husband with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Afterward, the husband left, and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. Physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if there was provocation, like yelling and mocking, using physical force is generally considered wrong. The fact that it was a closed-fist hit to the face suggests intentional harm. The husband's reaction was to leave, which might indicate he felt threatened or hurt. The author later acknowledges she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, showing some self-awareness.\n\nThe edits mention a troll account pretending to be the husband, but that doesn't change the initial action. The final edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" seems like a joke or a meme, possibly to mock the situation, but it's irrelevant to the main question.\n\nLegal and ethical standards usually condemn any form of domestic violence. Even if the argument was heated, hitting someone is not acceptable. The husband's yelling and mocking might be inappropriate too, but that doesn't justify the physical response. The author's edit says it was the first time, but that doesn't excuse the action. Apologizing is a good step, but the initial act was wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Physical violence is not acceptable regardless of the situation, and she took responsibility in her edit, which aligns with recognizing her mistake.\n"
