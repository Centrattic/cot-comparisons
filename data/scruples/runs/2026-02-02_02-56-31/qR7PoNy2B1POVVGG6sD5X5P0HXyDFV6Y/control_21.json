It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. \n\nFirst, the situation: They had a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. \n\nThe key points here are the escalation of the argument. He was yelling and mocking her, which could be seen as provocation. But regardless of that, hitting someone is a physical act of violence. Even if he was being an ass, using a closed fist to hit someone on the face is a violent action. \n\nIn most societal norms and legal standards, hitting someone, even in the heat of an argument, is considered wrong. It's a criminal act in many places. The fact that she later realizes her mistake and plans to apologize shows she acknowledges it was wrong, but the question is whether she was in the wrong in the first place.\n\nThe husband's response of calling her a name and driving off might indicate he was also reacting negatively, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. The question is about her actions, not his retaliation. \n\nEven if there's mutual provocation, the use of violence is typically seen as the person's fault. So the answer would be yes, she's in the wrong. However, sometimes people consider the context, like if there was prior abuse or a history of violence. But in this case, she says it's the first time this happened. \n\nBut hitting someone is still a clear act of violence. So the answer is A.\n"
