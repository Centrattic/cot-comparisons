It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The argument was about politics, specifically abortion, with different party affiliations. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. He then left, came back with a bruise, called her a name, and drove off. She hasn't seen him since. She later realizes her mistake and plans to apologize.\n\nNow, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many jurisdictions, using physical force against a spouse, even in the heat of an argument, is considered assault. Closed-fist hitting to the face would likely be a criminal act. However, there might be defenses like self-defense, but in this case, the husband was the initial aggressor by yelling and mocking, which might not be enough for self-defense. But the woman's action was a retaliatory punch, which might not be justified even if he was being aggressive. Self-defense usually involves preventing imminent harm, and yelling and mocking might not constitute that level of threat.\n\nEthically, even if someone is being verbally abusive, hitting them is a physical escalation that's generally not condoned. The fact that she acknowledges her mistake in an edit suggests she feels it was wrong, which aligns with societal norms where violence isn't the solution. The husband's reaction of leaving and calling her a name is also problematic, but the question is about who is in the wrong here.\n\nThe presence of a troll account pretending to be her husband adds a layer of confusion, but the main issue remains the initial act of hitting. The user also mentions that this was the first time such a thing happened. However, physical violence in a relationship is a serious matter regardless of frequency.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author did commit an act of physical violence, which is generally considered wrong. Even if provoked, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a significant action that could lead to legal consequences. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
