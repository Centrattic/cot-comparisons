It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple arguing about politics, which escalated to the wife hitting her husband. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The argument was political, but they usually ignore differences. This time, the husband started yelling and mocking her. In a rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. The user is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nThe user later edited to say she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize. Also, there's a troll comment at the end which is probably irrelevant. \n\nLegally, using physical force in an argument is generally not acceptable. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is an act of violence. Emotional reactions don't excuse it. However, the husband was yelling and mocking, which could be considered verbal abuse. But that doesn't justify a physical response.\n\nThe key here is whether the action was a proportionate response. Yelling and mocking, while hurtful, don't typically warrant a physical assault. Closed-fist hit to the face could be considered assault, depending on jurisdiction. The fact that there was a bruise suggests it wasn't just a minor push or slap, which adds to the severity.\n\nEven if the woman regrets it and wants to apologize, the act itself is wrong. The question is about who's in the wrong, not about forgiveness or future steps. So the answer would be A, yes, she's in the wrong. The husband's behavior was inappropriate too, but the physical violence is a more serious issue.\n"
