It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a big argument where the husband starts yelling and mocking. The author hits him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise, then he leaves. The author later realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The argument is about politics, which can be a sensitive topic. The husband yells and mocks, which is disrespectful. The author responds with physical violence by hitting him. Even if provoked, using physical aggression is generally not acceptable. The fact that it's the first time and she's planning to apologize might mitigate some blame, but hitting someone in a domestic dispute is still a problem. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving is also poor, but that doesn't justify the hit. The author's actions caused harm, even if minor. So, from a moral standpoint, the author is likely at fault here. The answer should be A.\n"
