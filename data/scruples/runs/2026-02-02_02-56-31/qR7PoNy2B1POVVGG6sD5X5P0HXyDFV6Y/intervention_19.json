It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. They mentioned they usually ignore political differences, but this time it escalated. He was yelling and mocking her, so she hit him. Now he's gone and she's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is a big deal. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. But the husband also yelled and mocked her, which isn't great either. However, using physical force can cross a line because it's a form of abuse. The edits show she realizes her mistake and wants to apologize, which is good. The part about the troll account might be trying to add more context, but the main issue is the punch. Also, the last edit seems like a joke or troll, possibly affecting the tone.\n\nIn most cases, even if there's mutual escalation, physical contact is not acceptable. The answer here is likely A. She's in the wrong for hitting him. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving is also bad, but the physical act is more serious. She's acknowledging it was wrong in the edit, which supports that.\n"
