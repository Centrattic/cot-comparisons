It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. They mentioned a political disagreement about abortion, which escalated into yelling and mocking from him. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Now he's gone, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, physical violence is a big deal. Even in the heat of an argument, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. Emotional reactions can cloud judgment, but using physical force can cause harm and damage trust. She acknowledges she did something wrong in her edit, which is a good sign. Apologizing is important here.\n\nOn the other hand, he was yelling and mocking her, which isn't acceptable either. His behavior likely contributed to the escalation. But that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both parties have some responsibility, but the act of physical violence is a clear issue. The relationship dynamics matter too; if this is a pattern of behavior, it's more concerning. But she says it's the first time, so maybe there's room for growth.\n\nThe troll account comment and the random edit about gamers might be distractions, but the core issue remains. The key point is that using physical force in an argument is not acceptable, regardless of provocation. So, even if he was being an asshole, hitting him is wrong. She needs to take responsibility and work on resolving conflicts without violence. So the answer is A.\n"
