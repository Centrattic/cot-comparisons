It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement that escalated into yelling and mockery from the husband, leading the author to punch him, causing a small bruise. Then the husband left, and the author is now seeking opinions on whether they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The argument started over politics, specifically abortion. They usually avoid discussing politics, but this time it got heated. The husband started yelling and mocking the author, which led her to hit him. She then mentions that this was a closed-fist hit to the face. After that, he left, and she hasn't seen him since. The author added an edit later saying she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows some self-awareness.\n\nNow, considering the actions, using physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if provoked, hitting someone is not acceptable. The husband's yelling and mocking are problematic, but that doesn't justify the author's response. There's a fine line between self-defense and assault. Since the hit resulted in a bruise, it's considered an injury, which could be classified as assault depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nAlso, the author's afterthought about apologizing suggests she acknowledges her wrongdoing. The initial question is whether she's the asshole for punching him or if he's overreacting. The community usually looks at both parties, but in cases of physical violence, the person who initiated the physical contact is often held more accountable, especially in a relationship. The husband's behavior was inappropriate too, but physical violence is a more severe action. The author's use of a closed fist to the face is aggressive and could have caused more harm. Even if the husband was yelling, that doesn't make her action justified. \n\nAdditionally, the edits show that she's trying to address the issue by apologizing, but the initial act still stands. The presence of a troll account pretending to be the husband might be a red herring, but it's not relevant to the main question here. The final edit seems like a joke and might be a mistake, but it's irrelevant to the core issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while both parties had issues, the author's use of physical violence is a clear wrong. The answer is A because she is in the wrong for hitting her husband, even if provoked.\n"
