It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're the asshole for hitting their husband during an argument. They mention political differences leading to a big fight where he was yelling and mocking her. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He left afterward.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is generally wrong. Even if there's provocation, hitting someone is not acceptable. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face suggests it was intentional and could have caused harm. She admits she was in a rage, which might explain the action, but it doesn't justify it. He called her a name and left, but that doesn't excuse her violence.\n\nShe later realizes her mistake and wants to apologize, which is a good step. But the initial action\u2014hitting\u2014crosses a line. Relationships require non-violent communication. Even if the argument was heated, physical aggression is not the solution. Also, the fact that it's their first time doing this might be a mitigating factor, but the action itself is still wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
