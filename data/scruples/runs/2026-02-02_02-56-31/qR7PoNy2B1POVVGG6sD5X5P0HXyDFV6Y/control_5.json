It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement escalating into physical violence. \n\nFirst, the woman and her husband usually ignore their political differences, but this time it got heated. He started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. He left, and now she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nLooking at the details, physical violence is generally considered wrong in a relationship. Even if provoked, hitting someone is not acceptable. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face suggests it was intentional and could have caused more harm. The husband's reaction was to leave, and she admits she'll apologize, acknowledging her mistake. The edits also show she's taking responsibility, which is important.\n\nHowever, the husband's yelling and mocking might be seen as provocation. But even so, physical violence is not an appropriate response. The key point here is that using physical force to resolve an argument, regardless of the provocation, is typically considered wrong. There's no mention of self-defense here, just a reaction to emotional tension.\n\nAlso, the user's initial question is whether she's the asshole (AITA). The community usually looks at both sides, but in this case, the physical aggression is a clear issue. Even if the husband was at fault for yelling, the woman's response crosses a line.\n\nSo, the answer would be Yes, the author is in the wrong because hitting someone, even in a heated argument, is not acceptable. She took responsibility in her edits, which is good, but the action itself is wrong.\n"
