It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences, yelling, and eventually a physical assault. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The argument started over politics, specifically abortion, with the husband being Republican and the author Democratic. They usually avoid discussing their political differences, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, leading the author to hit him with a closed fist. After that, he left, and she hasn't seen him since. The author is questioning if she was in the wrong or if he's overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the information: physical violence is generally not acceptable in any relationship. Even if there's provocation like yelling or mocking, hitting someone is a criminal act and can be considered assault. The author admits in an edit that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, which suggests she acknowledges her wrongdoing. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and driving off also indicates conflict, but that doesn't justify the physical hit from her.\n\nThe additional edits mention a troll account and a random comment, which might be distractions but don't change the main issue. The key action here is the author hitting her husband, which is a clear case of physical aggression. Even if the husband was being offensive, using violence is not an appropriate response. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, domestic violence is a serious issue, and any physical altercation in a relationship is typically seen as the aggressor being at fault. The fact that this was a first-time incident and she's planning to apologize might mitigate the situation, but it doesn't negate the wrongfulness of the action itself.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because hitting someone, regardless of the circumstances, is an act of violence and is not justified.\n"
