It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for hitting their husband during a political argument. The husband is a Republican, and they usually avoid discussing politics, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, so she hit him with a closed fist. Now he's run off, she saw him with a bruise later, and he called her a name and left. She hasn't seen him since and is wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her action was justified. Hitting someone, even in anger, is generally considered wrong. Physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue and can cross a line into abuse. The fact that he was yelling and mocking her doesn't make her hitting him acceptable. Even if he provoked her, responding with violence isn't the right way to handle it. She should have tried to de-escalate the situation, maybe by walking away or using words to express her feelings without physical aggression.\n\nShe mentions it's the first time this has happened and she wants to apologize, which is a good step. However, the act itself was wrong regardless of the reason. The bruise indicates that there was physical harm, and using derogatory language is also a problem. The husband's reaction of driving off might be his way of handling the situation, but that doesn't excuse her actions. In a healthy relationship, both parties should avoid physical violence and verbal insults.\n\nThe edits also show that she's aware of her mistake now, which is important. The last edit about the troll account and the offensive term seems to be a red herring or maybe a way to provoke a reaction, but it's probably not relevant to the main issue. The key points are the argument, his yelling and mocking, her hitting him, and the consequences. So the answer here is A, she was in the wrong. Even if both sides had issues, the physical violence was her responsibility to avoid.\n"
