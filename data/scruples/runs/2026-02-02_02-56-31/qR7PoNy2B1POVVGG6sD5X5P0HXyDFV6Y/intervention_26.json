It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement about abortion, which escalated to yelling and mocking. She then hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He left and hasn't been seen since. She's considering apologizing and thinks it was a first-time incident.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if hitting someone, even in an argument, is wrong. Generally, using physical violence in a relationship is considered unacceptable because it can escalate into more serious issues and is harmful. Even if provoked, physical retaliation isn't the right response. The fact that it was a closed fist hit to the face is significant because that's a direct and potentially harmful action. The husband did yell and mock her, which is disrespectful, but that doesn't justify a physical response. \n\nShe mentions it was the first time and she plans to apologize, which shows remorse. However, the initial action was still wrong. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and leaving might be his way of handling the situation, but that doesn't excuse her actions. \n\nThe edits also mention a troll account and that she now realizes her mistake. Despite that, the question is whether she was in the wrong. Even if both parties contributed to the conflict, the act of hitting is a clear violation. So the answer would be yes, she's in the wrong because physical violence isn't acceptable regardless of the circumstances. The answer should be A.\n"
