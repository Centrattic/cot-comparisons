It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The husband was yelling and mocking, and she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Then he left and hasn't been back, calling her a name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They usually ignore political differences, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking, which might be part of the problem. She hit him first, which is physical violence. Even if provoked, using a closed fist to hit someone's face can be seen as excessive. But the question is about being in the wrong.\n\nIn many places, using physical force in a domestic dispute is generally considered wrong, even if there was provocation. The fact that he was yelling and mocking might be part of the context, but that doesn't necessarily justify hitting. She later realizes her mistake and wants to apologize. The husband's response of calling her a name and driving off also isn't great, but that doesn't excuse the hit.\n\nThe key points here are mutual escalation, but physical violence is a significant red flag. Even if there was verbal aggression, the physical action crosses a line. The user is being asked if they were in the wrong. The answer here would likely be yes, because hitting someone in an argument is generally not acceptable, regardless of provocation. So the answer should be A.\n"
