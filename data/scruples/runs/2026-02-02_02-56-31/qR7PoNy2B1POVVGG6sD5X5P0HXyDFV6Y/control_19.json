It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation is that they had a political argument, he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him, causing a bruise. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. Physical violence in any form is generally not acceptable. Even if there's provocation, hitting someone can be considered assault. The fact that they had political differences doesn't justify the physical act. The husband's behavior of yelling and mocking is bad too, but that doesn't make the hitting okay. \n\nThe author later admits that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, which shows she acknowledges her wrongdoing. The question is whether she's the asshole. In such situations, while both parties might have contributed to the argument, the physical violence is a clear boundary crossed. So, the answer would likely be A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the edits mention that she's taking responsibility now, but the initial action is still the key point. Even if it was the first time, hitting someone is a serious action. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving is also bad, but again, the question is about the author's actions. So, the conclusion is that she is in the wrong.\n"
