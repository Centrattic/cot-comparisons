It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a political argument, which escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her. In a rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He left afterward. She acknowledges her action was wrong in an edit, saying it was the first time and she'll apologize.\n\nNow, legally and ethically, using physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being abusive, hitting him is not an acceptable response. The fact that she hit him first and it resulted in a bruise is a form of assault, which is illegal. She later admits she was wrong, which is a good step, but the act itself is still a problem.\n\nSome might argue that he provoked her by yelling and mocking, but that doesn't justify physical violence. There's a difference between verbal and physical aggression. She had the option to walk away, de-escalate, or seek help instead of using force. Her response escalated the conflict, leading to him leaving and not returning.\n\nThe edits are important. She clarifies she's not making this up and admits her mistake. However, her initial action is what's under scrutiny. The fact that she's willing to apologize is positive, but it doesn't erase the wrongdoing.\n\nPossible counterarguments: If the husband's yelling was a form of abuse, maybe she felt cornered. But even in self-defense scenarios, the force used should be reasonable. A closed-fist hit to the face causing a bruise might be considered disproportionate if it's just verbal abuse. Also, in many places, self-defense during a verbal argument without physical contact might not hold up legally.\n\nAnother point is that mutual escalation in arguments can lead to poor decisions. She took the first physical action, which is a red flag in any relationship. Physical violence sets a dangerous precedent and can lead to a cycle of abuse or revenge.\n\nIn summary, while the husband's behavior was inappropriate and provoked her, her response of hitting him is not acceptable. The author is in the wrong because using physical violence, even in anger, is a violation in a relationship. She admitted her mistake, which is commendable, but the act itself remains wrong.\n"
