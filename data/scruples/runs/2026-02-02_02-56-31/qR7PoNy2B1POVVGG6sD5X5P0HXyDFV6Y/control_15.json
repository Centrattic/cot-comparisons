It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: political argument between a Democrat and a Republican spouse. They usually avoid discussing politics, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nI need to consider the context. Physical violence in relationships is generally a serious issue. Even if there's provocation, hitting someone can be seen as wrong. The question is whether the author's action was justified. The husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014might have contributed, but that doesn't make the punch acceptable. The author later admits she realizes she was wrong, so she's taking responsibility, which is a good sign.\n\nIn many cases, mutual respect and non-violence are key in relationships. Using physical force as a response to an argument is usually considered inappropriate. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and driving off also shows that he didn't handle the conflict well. However, the fact that the woman hit him with a closed fist leading to a bruise is a clear act of violence. \n\nLegal perspectives might vary, but socially, hitting someone even in anger is often frowned upon. The edit where she says she'll apologize shows remorse. But the initial act still stands. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to be careful. The husband's yelling and mockery might have been a trigger, but that doesn't justify the punch. The main point is that physical violence isn't the solution, so she's in the wrong.\n"
