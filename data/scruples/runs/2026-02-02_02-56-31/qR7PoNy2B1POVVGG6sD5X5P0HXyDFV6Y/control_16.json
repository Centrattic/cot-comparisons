It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a political argument between a husband and wife, which escalated into her hitting him, leading to him leaving and not returning. The author is asking if she's the asshole for punching him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The argument started over politics, specifically abortion. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it was a big argument. He started yelling and mocking her, which could be a provocation. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Then he left, called her a name, and drove off. She hasn't seen him since. She later realizes she's wrong and plans to apologize. There are edits where she mentions it's not her making a fake account and that she realizes her mistake.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Hitting someone, even in a heated argument, is physical violence. In most contexts, using violence in a relationship is considered wrong. Even if the other person was yelling or being disrespectful, a punch to the face causing a bruise is a serious physical act. The fact that she later apologized and acknowledges her mistake is important, but the initial action is still a problem. \n\nHowever, the husband's behavior might have contributed\u2014he was yelling and mocking her, which could have escalated the situation. But that doesn't justify her hitting him. In many legal and ethical frameworks, retaliation with physical violence is not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. \n\nThe edits show that she's taking responsibility now, which is positive, but the act itself is still a violation of healthy relationship boundaries. The fact that he left and called her a name adds to the tension, but again, hitting is not a solution. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she resorted to physical violence, which is not acceptable regardless of the circumstances. Even if there was provocation, using physical force in an argument is a clear mistake.\n"
