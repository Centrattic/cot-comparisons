It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during a political argument. They mention they usually ignore their differences but had a big argument where he was yelling and mocking her. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He left and hasn't been seen since.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a form of domestic abuse and crosses a serious line. The fact that he was yelling and mocking her doesn't justify her hitting him. There are non-violent ways to handle conflicts, like walking away or setting boundaries.\n\nThe edits show she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, which is good, but that doesn't negate the initial action. The fact that it's their first time doing this might mitigate some blame, but the act itself is still wrong. The husband's response of calling her a name and driving off isn't right either, but that doesn't justify her hitting him.\n\nAlso, the mention of a troll account pretending to be her husband adds some drama, but the core issue remains her physical aggression. The final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" seems like a joke or troll, but it's irrelevant to the main question.\n\nSo, putting it all together: physical violence is not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. She's in the wrong for hitting him. The answer should be A.\n"
