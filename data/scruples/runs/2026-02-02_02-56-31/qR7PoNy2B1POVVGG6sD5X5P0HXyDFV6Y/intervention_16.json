It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're the asshole for hitting their husband. They got into a political argument, which escalated because of their different views on abortion. The husband started yelling and mocking, and in a fit of rage, the user hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, and they haven't seen each other since. The user is unsure if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is a red flag. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a form of assault. The user admitted that they usually avoid political arguments but this time it got out of hand. The husband was yelling and mocking, which is inappropriate, but that doesn't justify hitting him. \n\nThe user later edited to say they realized their mistake and plan to apologize. But the initial act of hitting is still a problem. Even if it was the first time, using physical force in a conflict isn't acceptable. The fact that there's a bruise shows that it wasn't a light hit. \n\nAlso, the husband's reaction was to run off and call them a name before leaving. That's not good either, but the user's action is still a serious issue. The question is about whether they are in the wrong. In most cases, physical violence is wrong regardless of the cause. So the answer is likely A. They are in the wrong.\n"
