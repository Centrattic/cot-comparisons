It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had an argument with their husband about politics, specifically abortion. Their husband is Republican, they're Democrat. They usually ignore political differences, but this time it escalated into a big argument. The husband started yelling and mocking, and in a fit of rage, they punched him with a closed fist to the face. Then the husband left, they saw a bruise, and he called them a name before leaving. Now they're wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider domestic violence and the use of physical force in a relationship. Hitting someone, even in anger, is generally not acceptable. Regardless of the provocation, using physical violence crosses a line. The fact that the husband was yelling and mocking might be a contributing factor, but that doesn't make hitting okay. The user later edited their post to say they realize they were wrong and plan to apologize, which shows some self-awareness.\n\nBut then there's the husband's response. He called them a \"bitch\" and left, but he was also the one who started the shouting and mocking. However, responding to verbal abuse with physical violence is still not justified. So, even if the husband was being an asshole, hitting him isn't the right response. The user's action caused a physical injury (a bruise), which is a form of assault. \n\nAlso, the user mentions that this was the first time such a thing happened. That might be a mitigating factor, but it doesn't excuse the action. The key point is that physical violence is not an acceptable way to resolve conflicts, even in the heat of the moment. The fact that the husband left and didn't retaliate further might suggest that he wasn't the initial aggressor in the physical sense, which could support that the user was in the wrong for initiating the physical contact.\n\nThe edits also include a troll account and a later edit that seems like a joke (\"GAMERS RISE UP...\"), which might indicate the user is trying to downplay the situation or was being facetious. But the original question is serious, so the answer should focus on the actual scenario described before the edits.\n\nIn summary, even though the husband was being verbally abusive, the user's response with physical violence is not justified. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the user is in the wrong).\n"
