It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument about politics. The key points here are the context of the argument, the escalation to yelling and mocking, and the physical response.\n\nFirst, physical violence is generally not acceptable, even in heated arguments. The fact that the user hit their husband with a closed fist leading to a bruise is a clear act of aggression. While the husband did yell and mock, which is disrespectful, using physical force in response crosses a line. \n\nThe user mentions that they usually ignore political differences, so this seems like an exceptional situation. However, the response to yelling with a punch is problematic. It's important to note that mutual respect and communication are crucial in relationships, and violence undermines that foundation.\n\nThe user's plan to apologize is a positive step, but the initial action (hitting) is still wrong. Even if there was provocation, resorting to physical violence isn't justified. The husband's reaction of calling them a \"bitch\" and leaving might indicate his own issues in handling conflict, but that doesn't excuse the user's actions.\n\nConsidering all factors, the user did commit an act of physical violence, which is typically considered wrong regardless of the circumstances. So, the answer is A.\n"
