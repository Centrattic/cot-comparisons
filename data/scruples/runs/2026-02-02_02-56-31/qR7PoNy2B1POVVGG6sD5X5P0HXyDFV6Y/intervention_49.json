It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation started with political differences about abortion, which led to a big argument. The husband was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. He ran off, and later he called her a \"bitch\" and left.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if he was being abusive with his words, hitting him was a physical response that crossed a line. She acknowledges this in her edit, saying she realizes it was wrong. She plans to apologize, which shows she recognizes her mistake.\n\nHowever, the husband's behavior is also problematic. Yelling and mocking can contribute to a hostile environment. But regardless of his actions, using physical violence is not an appropriate response. It escalates the conflict and can lead to more serious consequences. The fact that he left and called her a name isn't an excuse for her actions but does indicate mutual conflict.\n\nThe user is taking responsibility now, but the initial action of hitting is still wrong. The key point here is that physical aggression is not justified, even in the heat of an argument. So, even though there's context, the act itself is on her. Answer A.\n"
