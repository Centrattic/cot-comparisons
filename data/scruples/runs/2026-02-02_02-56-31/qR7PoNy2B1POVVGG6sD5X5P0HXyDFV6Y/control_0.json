It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement that escalated into yelling and then a physical altercation. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He left afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They usually avoid discussing their political differences, but this argument was significant. He was yelling and mocking her, which might have provoked her. However, hitting someone, even in anger, is generally considered a form of assault. Even if there was prior provocation, using physical force can be problematic.\n\nThe edits show that she later realizes her mistake and plans to apologize. She also mentions it was the first time something like this happened. The troll account edit might be an attempt to add credibility or deflect, but the main points are clear.\n\nLegally, in many places, assault includes any intentional physical contact without consent. A closed-fist hit to the face would likely qualify. Even in the heat of an argument, the law typically doesn't excuse it. Emotionally, while arguments can get heated, physical violence crosses a line. It's important to consider both legal and social perspectives here. Socially, using physical violence is often seen as wrong regardless of the reason. She acknowledges this by saying she'll apologize, indicating she sees it as wrong.\n\nThe husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off isn't excusing her actions but adds context to the escalation. However, it doesn't justify the punch. Both parties might have acted inappropriately, but the physical act is a key issue here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did commit an act that's generally considered wrong, both legally and socially, even if there were provocation. The answer would be A.\n"
