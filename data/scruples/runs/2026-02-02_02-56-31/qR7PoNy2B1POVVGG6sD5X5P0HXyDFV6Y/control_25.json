It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation is that they had a political argument, he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him. Now, the main question is whether she's the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what's considered acceptable in terms of resolving conflicts. Hitting someone, even in a heated argument, is generally considered physical violence. That's a big red flag. Even if the husband was being a jerk, using physical force is not acceptable. So the act of hitting him would make her wrong in most people's eyes.\n\nThe husband did start yelling and mocking her, which is inconsiderate and rude. But does that justify hitting him? Probably not. The key here is that she used physical violence, which is a clear wrongdoer action. People usually expect to resolve arguments without aggression. Even if the other person is being a jerk, hitting them crosses a line.\n\nAlso, she mentions that she's planning to apologize, which shows she realizes her mistake. But the fact that she did hit him is the main issue. The husband driving off after the argument might be an overreaction too, but that doesn't excuse her action. The question is about her wrongness, not his. \n\nThere's also an edit about a troll account pretending to be her husband, but that's probably irrelevant to the main issue. And the last edit has some offensive language, which might be a red herring or just a mistake. \n\nIn most relationships, using physical violence is a serious issue. Even if it's the first time, it's still wrong. So the answer here is that she is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
