It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're the asshole for hitting their husband during an argument. They mention the argument was about politics, specifically abortion, with differing views. The husband started yelling and mocking her, leading her to punch him. He left, and she hasn't seen him since. She later says she knows she was wrong and wants to apologize.\n\nFirst, using physical force in an argument is generally a red flag. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a form of domestic violence. The husband's yelling and mocking might have been disrespectful, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The user admits she was wrong in her edit, which shows self-awareness. However, the initial action still stands. The husband's reaction (calling her a name and leaving) isn't excusing her actions but adds context to their conflict. The key point is that physical violence is not acceptable in a relationship, regardless of provocation. So, the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
