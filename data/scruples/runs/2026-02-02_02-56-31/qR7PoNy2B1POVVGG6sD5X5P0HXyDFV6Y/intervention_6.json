It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for hitting their husband during an argument. They mention political differences leading to a big fight where he was yelling and mocking her. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He left and hasn't returned since. She realizes she might be wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong, regardless of the situation. Even if provoked, hitting someone is not an acceptable response. While the husband's yelling and mocking were inappropriate, that doesn't justify her hitting him. The key point here is that using physical force to resolve an argument is not acceptable. Relationships should be built on communication and respect, not aggression. She acknowledges her mistake and wants to apologize, which is a good step. However, the fact remains that she committed an act of violence, which is a serious issue. The husband's behavior was also wrong, but that doesn't excuse her actions. So, the answer is yes, she is in the wrong.\n"
