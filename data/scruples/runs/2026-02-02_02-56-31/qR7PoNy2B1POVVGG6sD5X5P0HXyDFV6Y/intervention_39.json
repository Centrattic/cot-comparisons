It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation is political differences leading to a big argument, he yells and mocks her, then she hits him. He left and she hasn't seen him since. She says she'll apologize and it was their first time doing something like that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in relationships is a big deal. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is not okay. The husband's yelling and mocking might be part of the problem, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The user admits she's wrong in her edit, but the question is whether she is in the wrong.\n\nIn most cases, using physical force in an argument, even if it's a closed fist hit, is considered a form of domestic violence. The fact that there's a bruise supports that. Even if it's the first time, the action itself is wrong. The user's edit shows she realizes this, but the original question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the husband's reaction\u2014calling her a name and driving off\u2014might be his way of handling conflict, but that doesn't excuse her actions. The key point is that physical aggression is not acceptable regardless of the situation. So the answer should be A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
