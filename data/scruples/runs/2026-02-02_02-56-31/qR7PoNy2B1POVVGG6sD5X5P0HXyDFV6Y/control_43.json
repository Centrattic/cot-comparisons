It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple with political differences, specifically about abortion, leading to an argument. The husband yells and mocks her, and she hits him. Now, she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The argument started over politics, which can be a sensitive topic. The husband is Republican, she's Democrat. They usually avoid discussing it, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, so she hit him. Then he left and hasn't come back. She acknowledges her mistake in an edit, saying she'll apologize, and it was the first time. The user wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of domestic situations, using physical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of provocation. Even if the husband was being abusive or yelling, hitting him could be considered a wrong action. However, there's the context of self-defense or proportional response. But in this case, she hit him in the face with a closed fist, causing a bruise. That's more than just a light hit. The husband's response was to call her a name and leave, but her action was the use of force.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, using physical force in response to verbal abuse might not be justified unless there's an immediate threat of harm. Since the husband was yelling but not necessarily physically threatening, her hitting him could be seen as the wrong action. Also, the fact that she later realized her mistake and wants to apologize shows she's aware it was wrong, which supports that she is in the wrong.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of mutual escalation. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) contributed to the argument. But even so, using physical violence typically crosses a line. So the answer here would likely be A, the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband, regardless of his behavior.\n"
