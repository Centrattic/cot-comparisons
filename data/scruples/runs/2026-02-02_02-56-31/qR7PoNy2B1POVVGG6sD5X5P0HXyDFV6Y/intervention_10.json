It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument about politics. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they mention they usually ignore their political differences, but this time the argument escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, leading her to punch him. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's considering apologizing and says this was the first time such a thing happened.\n\nNow, the key points here are the use of physical violence. Hitting someone, even in anger, is generally considered wrong. Even if provoked, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a clear act of physical aggression. While the husband's yelling and mocking might have contributed to the situation, it doesn't justify the response. Domestic violence is a serious issue, and any form of physical harm in a relationship is a red flag. The user acknowledges her mistake in an edit, showing some self-awareness. However, the initial action of hitting is still wrong. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and leaving might have been inappropriate too, but that doesn't negate her responsibility. So, considering all factors, the answer would be A, she's in the wrong because she used physical violence.\n"
