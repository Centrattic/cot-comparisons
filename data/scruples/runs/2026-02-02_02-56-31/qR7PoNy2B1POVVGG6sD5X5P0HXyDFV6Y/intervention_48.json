It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. They mention that the argument was about politics, specifically abortion, with differing views. They usually avoid political discussions, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. Now he's left, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him is a form of physical aggression that can escalate conflicts. The user acknowledges that she's aware of her mistake and plans to apologize, which is a good step. However, the act itself is wrong because it's not solving the problem and can lead to more harm. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving might be his way of handling the situation, but that doesn't justify her actions. It's important to address conflicts without physical violence. So, the answer would be that she's in the wrong.\n"
