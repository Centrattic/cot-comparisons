It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for hitting her husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the argument started over politics\u2014abortion specifically. They usually avoid discussing their political differences, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led the author to hit him with a closed fist, resulting in a small bruise. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. The author is questioning if she was wrong or if he's overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the facts. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, using physical violence is generally not acceptable. In most societies, hitting someone, even in anger, is considered wrong because it crosses into physical aggression, which can lead to more serious issues. The author admits in her edit that she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize, which suggests she acknowledges her mistake.\n\nThe husband's response (calling her a name and leaving) is also problematic, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both parties might have acted inappropriately, but the key point here is the use of physical violence. In relationships, using physical force to resolve conflicts is usually seen as a major issue because it can escalate into domestic abuse. Even if there was provocation, the appropriate response isn't to hit.\n\nThe author's initial defense might lean on the husband's behavior, but the act of hitting someone is typically on the person who does it. So, while the husband's yelling wasn't good, the author's action is what's in question here. Also, the edits show her acknowledgment of wrongdoing, which reinforces that she was in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
