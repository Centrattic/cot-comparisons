It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that she had an argument with her husband about politics, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him. Then he left, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. She mentions they usually ignore their political differences, but this time the argument escalated. He was yelling and mocking, which she found offensive, leading her to hit him. The hit was a closed fist to the face, causing a small bruise. Now, she's apologized and wants to make up.\n\nLegally, using physical force in a domestic setting can be problematic. Even in self-defense, there are specific conditions that need to be met. Since this was an argument without any immediate threat of serious harm, her response might be considered excessive. The fact that she used a closed fist to hit someone's face generally isn't seen as a proportionate response, even if provoked.\n\nAlso, the context of a domestic relationship matters. Physical violence between partners is a form of abuse and is not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him isn't a justified reaction. The fact that she later apologized and wants to make up is a good step, but it doesn't negate the wrongness of the action.\n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual respect in relationships. While arguments can get heated, resorting to physical violence sets a dangerous precedent. It can lead to a cycle of aggression and may have legal consequences. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and leaving might be his way of dealing with the situation, but it doesn't excuse her actions.\n\nI should also consider cultural or social norms. In many societies, any form of physical violence is discouraged, especially within relationships. The initial provocation (yelling and mocking) might be hurtful, but it doesn't justify a physical response. It's important to address conflicts through communication rather than physical means.\n\nAdditionally, the edit about a troll account pretending to be her husband might indicate that the situation is more complex, but the original question is about her actions. The troll edit might be a red herring or an attempt to deflect, but the user is asking about her responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's behavior was inappropriate, the author's response of hitting him is not acceptable. Physical violence is a wrong response, and she is in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
