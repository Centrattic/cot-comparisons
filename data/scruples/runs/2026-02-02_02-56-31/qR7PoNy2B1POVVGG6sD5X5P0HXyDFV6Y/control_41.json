It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement, he was Republican and she's a Democrat, specifically about abortion. The argument escalated, he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In any conflict, physical violence is generally not acceptable. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is a form of assault. The husband was yelling and mocking, which could be seen as emotional abuse, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The key here is that physical violence escalates the situation and can lead to more harm.\n\nThe user also mentioned that she later realized her mistake and plans to apologize. She acknowledges it's wrong, which is a good step. But the act itself is still a problem. In many places, even if both parties are at fault in an argument, hitting someone can be considered a crime, especially since it resulted in a bruise. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and driving off might indicate his own issues, but that doesn't make her actions right.\n\nAlso, the part where someone made a troll account pretending to be her husband adds a layer of complexity, but the main issue is still her initial action. Even if he was being an asshole, hitting him is not the solution. The question is about whether she's in the wrong, and in most societal and legal contexts, using physical violence in a domestic argument is not justified unless it's self-defense, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A. Yes, the author is in the wrong for physically assaulting her husband, even if the argument was heated. The use of violence is not acceptable regardless of the provocation.\n"
