It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband. They had a political argument, he was yelling and mocking, then she hit him. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's generally considered right or wrong in such situations. Physical violence is usually not acceptable in relationships, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being disrespectful, hitting him is a form of physical aggression which can escalate conflicts. The fact that she hit him with a closed fist and caused a bruise is a clear instance of assault, which is both legally and morally problematic.\n\nHowever, the husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) also isn't great. But that doesn't justify her response. The question isn't about who started it, but whether her action was wrong. Most conflict resolution advice says that physical violence is never the solution. So from a moral standpoint, she likely did something wrong here.\n\nThe edits show she's aware of her mistake and plans to apologize, which is good. The part about the troll account and the last edit with \"YEET niggga\" might be trying to add humor or deflect, but the main issue is her action. \n\nSo, even though the husband's behavior contributed to the situation, her response was a physical attack, which is typically considered wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
