It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences, specifically about abortion, which led to a big fight. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in a rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He left after calling her a name.\n\nFirst, physical violence is a serious issue in any relationship. Even if provoked, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. While the husband's yelling and mocking might have contributed to the tension, the user's response was a physical attack. It's important to acknowledge that mutual respect and de-escalation are key in arguments. The user admits it was their first time reacting like that and plans to apologize, which is a positive step. However, the act itself is a problem. The husband's reaction of driving off might be immature, but it doesn't justify the violence. The user's action crossed a line, so they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
