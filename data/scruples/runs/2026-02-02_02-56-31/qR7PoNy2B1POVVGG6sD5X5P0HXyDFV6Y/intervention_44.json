It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hit their husband during an argument. The key points here are the context and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, they mention they usually ignore political differences, but this argument got heated. The husband started yelling and mocking her. In a moment of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's now wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFrom a general perspective, using physical violence in a relationship is almost always wrong, regardless of provocation. Even if the husband was yelling, hitting him escalated the situation. The fact that she realized her mistake and plans to apologize shows some self-awareness, but the action itself is still problematic. Also, the husband's reaction\u2014calling her a name and leaving\u2014might indicate his hurt or anger, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. \n\nThe edits suggest she's acknowledging her mistake, which is positive, but the initial act of hitting someone is a clear violation of non-violence in relationships. So, the answer would lean towards her being in the wrong.\n"
