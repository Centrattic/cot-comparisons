It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after hitting their husband during an argument. They mention it was over political differences, specifically abortion, which led to yelling and mocking. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left and called her a name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in any relationship is a serious issue. Even if it's a first-time incident, hitting someone is a clear act of aggression. The question is whether that makes her the asshole.\n\nIn many places, mutual combat can be a factor, but that doesn't justify physical harm. The fact that he was yelling and mocking might explain her anger, but it doesn't excuse hitting him. She acknowledges it was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows she knows hitting isn't acceptable. \n\nThe husband's reaction of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off might indicate he escalated things, but his actions don't make her physical assault okay. Relationships require resolving conflicts without violence. Even if both were at fault in the argument, the physical hit is a red line.\n\nAlso, the edits show she's taking responsibility now, which is good, but the initial action is still problematic. So the answer is likely A (she's in the wrong) because using physical force is not acceptable, regardless of provocation.\n"
