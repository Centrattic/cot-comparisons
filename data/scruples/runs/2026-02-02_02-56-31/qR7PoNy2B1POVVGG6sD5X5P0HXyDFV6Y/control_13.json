It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement about abortion, he was Republican and she's a Democrat. He started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, called her a \"bitch,\" and drove off. She hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her action of hitting him is justified or not. The key points here are mutual escalation of the argument, emotional reactions, and the use of physical violence. Even if he was being verbally abusive, does that make her hitting him wrong?\n\nFrom a general standpoint, using physical violence is usually considered wrong regardless of the provocation. Even if someone is yelling or being disrespectful, hitting is an aggressive act that can lead to harm. So, in most ethical frameworks, the person who uses physical violence is at fault. However, some might argue self-defense if there was imminent danger, but in this case, it's a domestic argument without mention of threats or physical aggression from him before she hit him.\n\nThe husband's response was to call her a name and leave, which adds to the tension but doesn't justify her initial act. The author later acknowledges she was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows she realizes her mistake. The troll edit is a red herring and not relevant to the main question.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is wrong) because physical violence is not acceptable, even in response to verbal abuse. There are better ways to handle conflicts without resorting to hitting. The fact that she's apologizing now shows she understands this, but the act itself was wrong.\n"
