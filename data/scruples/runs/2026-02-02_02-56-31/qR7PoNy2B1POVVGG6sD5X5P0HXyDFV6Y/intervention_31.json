It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. They mention they usually ignore political differences, but this time it got heated. The husband was yelling and mocking them, which led them to punch him. The husband left and there's a bruise. The user is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if the husband was being verbally abusive, hitting him is not justified. The user admits they acted in a fit of rage. While verbal abuse is wrong, using physical force can escalate the situation and is generally considered inappropriate. The user is taking responsibility now and wants to apologize, which is good, but the act itself is problematic. The husband's reaction was also poor, but that doesn't excuse the punch. So, the answer is likely A, they are in the wrong.\n"
