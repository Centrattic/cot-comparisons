It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with political differences leading to an argument. The husband starts yelling and mocking, and the wife hits him. Then he leaves, and she's questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The argument started over politics, which can be sensitive. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. The husband's actions\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014are negative and disrespectful. However, the wife's response was hitting him with a closed fist. Even if provoked, using physical violence is a problem.\n\nIn most cases, violence is never acceptable, regardless of the situation. The fact that it was a closed fist hit to the face would likely be considered assault. She acknowledges she's wrong in her edit, which shows self-awareness, but the act itself is still wrong. The husband's response of calling her a name and driving off is also poor, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. \n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual respect in a relationship. Even in disagreements, physical violence breaks that trust. The wife's apology is a good step, but the initial action is problematic. So, considering all that, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
