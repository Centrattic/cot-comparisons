It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for hitting her husband. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a political argument about abortion, which led to yelling and mocking. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which escalated the situation. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, calling her a bitch and driving off. Now she hasn't seen him since and is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nI need to determine if her action of hitting him makes her the wrongdoer here. The key points to consider are the context of the argument, the escalation, and the use of physical violence. \n\nPhysical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking her, hitting him with a closed fist leading to a bruise is considered assault. While the husband's behavior was inconsiderate and perhaps contributed to the escalation, that doesn't justify her hitting him. \n\nThe edits show that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, but the initial action of hitting him is still wrong. The law typically doesn't excuse physical violence even if the other person was being verbally abusive. Also, relationships require communication and resolving conflicts without violence. \n\nThe part about the troll account and the last edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems like a red herring or possible troll, but the main question is about her hitting him. \n\nSo, even though the husband's yelling might have been a trigger, the use of physical force is not justified. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
