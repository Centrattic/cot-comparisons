It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a political argument with their husband, which escalated. Their husband started yelling and mocking them, and in a fit of rage, they hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Now the husband called them a \"bitch\" and drove off. The user is asking if they're the asshole for punching him.\n\nFirst, using physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being a jerk, hitting someone is a form of domestic violence. The user acknowledges that they're sorry and it was their first time, but the fact remains that they used physical aggression. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband was yelling and mocking, which is also not okay. Verbal abuse can be just as harmful, and it's a contributing factor here. However, the threshold for acceptable behavior is crossed when it comes to physical harm. Hitting someone, even once, is a serious issue because it can lead to more violence and sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nThe user's edit mentions that they realize they were wrong and plan to apologize. That's a good sign, but the initial action is still problematic. It's important to consider both parties' actions, but the physical assault is a key point here. Even in self-defense or extreme anger, hitting someone is not justified. The husband's response of calling them a name and leaving is also not acceptable, but it's a different type of behavior.\n\nSo, while the husband's actions contributed to the escalation, the user's decision to hit their spouse is a clear violation of non-violence in a relationship. Therefore, the answer is likely A, as they are in the wrong for using physical violence.\n"
