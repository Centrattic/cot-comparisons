It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences, escalating into yelling and physical violence.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is typically a serious issue. Even if provoked, using a closed fist to hit someone, especially in the face, causing a bruise, is considered assault. The fact that the husband left and called her a name might show he escalated the conflict, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The woman acknowledges her mistake in an edit and plans to apologize, which shows some self-awareness. However, the initial action of hitting him is a clear act of violence. The edits also mention a first-time incident, which might mitigate the severity slightly, but it's still a harmful action. The presence of a fake account complicates things a bit, but the main issue is between the couple. In most contexts, using physical force in an argument is wrong regardless of provocation. So, even though both might have acted poorly, the author's action crosses a line. The answer should be A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
