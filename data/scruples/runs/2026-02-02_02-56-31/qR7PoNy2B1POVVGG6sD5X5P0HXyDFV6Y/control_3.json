It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they had a political argument with their husband. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it got big. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him in the face with a closed fist. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole for punching him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The key points here are that she hit her husband, which is a physical act. Even if he was yelling and mocking her, using physical violence is generally not acceptable. The question is whether her action was justified. In most societies, using violence in an argument, even if the other person was being verbally abusive, is considered wrong because it escalates the conflict and can lead to harm. The husband's response was to run off and call her a name, which might be his way of dealing with the situation, but her hitting him is a criminal act in many places. \n\nShe also mentions that she realized it was wrong and plans to apologize. That's a good step, but the act itself is still a problem. The first edit about the troll account is probably to throw off the responses, but the original question is about her action. The second edit shows she's taking responsibility, which is important. However, the initial act of hitting someone, regardless of the provocation, is a clear violation of non-violence. People can argue verbally, but physical violence is a different matter. \n\nSo, even though there was an argument and he might have been abusive, the correct answer here is that she is in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
