It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for hitting their husband. The situation started with a political argument about abortion, which escalated because they usually avoid discussing politics. The husband started yelling and mocking her, leading to her hitting him with a closed fist. He left, came back with a bruise, called her a bitch, and drove off. She's considering apologizing and believes it was a first-time incident.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. Physical violence between partners is a serious issue. Even in the heat of an argument, hitting someone is a form of abuse and is generally considered wrong regardless of context. The husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014might contribute to the escalation, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The user acknowledges that what she did was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows some self-awareness. However, the outcome is that the husband left and she hasn't seen him since, which complicates things. The edits mention she realizes her mistake and wants to make up, but the initial question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nIn most cases, using physical force in an argument is not acceptable. While the husband's actions may have been provocative, the appropriate response would not involve hitting. The fact that it's a first-time incident is noted, but that doesn't negate the action's seriousness. The user's justification might be that he provoked her, but societal norms and relationship advice typically advise against physical retaliation. The husband's response of calling her a name and driving off adds to the tension but doesn't excuse her hitting him.\n\nSo, the analysis leans towards the user being in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
