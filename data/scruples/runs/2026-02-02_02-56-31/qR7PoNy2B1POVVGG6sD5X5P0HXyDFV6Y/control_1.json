It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that she had an argument with her husband about politics, which escalated to him yelling and mocking her. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Physical violence in a relationship is a big deal. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him is a form of assault. The woman admits she hit him, which is a clear physical aggression. While the husband's behavior was inappropriate too (yelling and mocking), that doesn't justify her response. The use of a closed fist to the face can cause injury, and she did cause a bruise. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, mutual combat or self-defense might be factors, but here it seems like she initiated the physical violence. Also, the fact that she called him a \"bitch\" and he responded by leaving adds to the complexity. However, the main issue is the act of hitting. Even if both parties were at fault in the argument, the physical action is typically seen as a more serious breach. \n\nShe also later edited to say she realized she was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows some self-awareness. But the initial action is still problematic. The question is about whether she's in the wrong, not just the legal aspect but societal judgment. In most cases, using physical violence in an argument is considered wrong, regardless of provocation. So the answer would be A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
