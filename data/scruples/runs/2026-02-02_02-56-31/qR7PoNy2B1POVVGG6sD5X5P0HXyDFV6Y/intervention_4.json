It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. They mention political differences about abortion, he was yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him. Now he's gone, and she's wondering if she's the asshole or if he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the situation. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is a form of domestic violence. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face is concerning. She acknowledges she did something wrong in her edit, which is a good step. But the question is whether she was in the wrong initially. \n\nHer husband was yelling and mocking her, which is disrespectful, but that doesn't justify hitting him. The response to verbal abuse with physical violence can escalate things. The fact that he left and she hasn't seen him since might indicate he's upset or concerned about the situation. The user also edited to say it was the first time and that she plans to apologize. \n\nThe troll account edit is a red herring here; it doesn't affect the main issue. The second edit shows she's aware of her mistake. But the initial action of hitting him is still problematic. So, even if there was provocation, using physical violence isn't acceptable. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
