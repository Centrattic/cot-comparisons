My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. Their mom had a pretty rough history with them\u2014arrested for neglect and drug use, left the state, couldn't contact them until they were 18. They were adopted, which probably helped, but now the biological mom is trying to reconnect. The person hasn't responded because they feel hurt and disconnected, even though the mom is apologizing and trying to be part of their life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if not responding to \"I love you\" messages is wrong. Well, the user isn't in the wrong if they have valid reasons. The mom did abandon them due to drug abuse and legal issues, which is a significant betrayal. The user's emotional response is understandable. They haven't blocked her, just aren't replying. The mom initiated contact after years of absence, but the user is struggling with forgiveness and reconnecting. \n\nIs the user being an asshole? Probably not. They're dealing with past trauma and aren't ready to reconnect. The mom's actions in the past were harmful, and the user's decision to not respond is a boundary they need to set for their own healing. The key points here are the history of abandonment, the user's emotional state, and the fact that they're not ignoring her out of spite, but due to genuine pain and uncertainty. So the answer should be B.\n"
