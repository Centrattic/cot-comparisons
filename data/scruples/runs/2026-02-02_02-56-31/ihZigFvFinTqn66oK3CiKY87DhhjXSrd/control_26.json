My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a child ignoring their mother's messages for years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person's mother was arrested when they were 6 for neglect and drug use. The mom was forced to leave the state and couldn't contact the child until they turned 18. When they did, the mother reached out via Facebook, but the person felt hurt by the lack of information and the mother's past actions. Now, the mother sends messages expressing love and missing the person, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault for not responding. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the reasons behind the author's actions. The mother's past neglect and drug abuse caused significant trauma. The author has been in foster care and adopted by a new family, which provided a stable environment. When the mother reconnected, she admitted to drug use during pregnancy and couldn't provide answers about the child's heritage. This might have caused emotional pain, making it hard for the author to reconnect or show affection.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, the author might be dealing with unresolved trauma. The mother's absence and the circumstances of the separation could justify the author's emotional distance. The author isn't ignoring out of spite but because they can't emotionally connect to someone who caused them harm and then is distant for years.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the mother is trying to rebuild the relationship and deserves a response. But given the history of neglect and the author's emotional state, it's a personal decision about healing and boundaries. The author isn't obligated to respond if it's not in their best interest. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (no), the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons rooted in past trauma and the mother's actions. The mother initiated contact after years of absence, but the author's emotional response is a result of justified hurt and trauma.\n"
