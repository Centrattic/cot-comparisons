My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who asked the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. \n\nFirst, the backstory: The person was in foster care from age 6 due to their mom's drug abuse and neglect. They were adopted and had a good relationship with their adoptive parents. After turning 18, the biological mom tried to reconnect but didn't have answers about the child's heritage or father. The mom has since cleaned up her life and is trying to be part of the person's life again.\n\nThe person hasn't responded to their mom's messages, which include expressions of love and support. They feel justified because of the mom's past and their lack of relationship. The key points here are the history of abandonment, the mom's past issues, and the adoptee's emotional response.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on the context of their past. The mom did wrong by the child when they were young, leading to separation. The adoptive parents have been supportive. The biological mom's attempts to reconnect are genuine, but the adoptee has a right to process their feelings and set boundaries. \n\nThe adoptee hasn't been ignoring the messages out of spite but because of trauma and a lack of connection. So, they're not in the wrong for not responding. It's about healing and personal choice. The mom's actions in the past were harmful, and the adoptee is still dealing with that. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
