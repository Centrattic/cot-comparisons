My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complicated. The user was in foster care, adopted at a young age, and their biological mom was arrested for neglect and drug abuse. She couldn't contact them until they were 18. Now, she's trying to reconnect, but the user feels hurt and doesn't know how to respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They had a traumatic childhood, separated from their mom, and then had to deal with her past. They might feel anger, betrayal, or confusion. Their adoptive parents are supportive, which is important. The user is not ignoring messages out of meanness but because of unresolved trauma and difficulty forming a bond with someone who wasn't present in their life.\n\nOn the other hand, the biological mom is reaching out, expressing remorse, and trying to be a part of their life now. She's clean now and found faith. But the user isn't ready to accept her, which is understandable given the history. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for not responding.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a simple yes or no. The user's feelings are valid. They have the right to set boundaries, especially after such a history. Ignoring the messages might be a way to protect themselves emotionally. However, completely cutting off communication without any response could be seen as harsh by some, even if the user has reasons.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014severe neglect, being a stranger, and the user's need to process their feelings\u2014it's more about the user's emotional well-being. They're not being inconsiderate; they're dealing with deep-seated issues. The mom's actions in the past can't be undone, so the user's response is a reaction to that history.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B, meaning the user isn't in the wrong. They're allowed to take time to heal and decide if and when they want to build a relationship. However, maybe suggesting they consider professional help or finding a middle ground in communication could be helpful, but the question is specifically about being in the wrong.\n"
