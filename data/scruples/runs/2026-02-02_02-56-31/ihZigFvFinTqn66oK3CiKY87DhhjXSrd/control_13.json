My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The mom sends messages expressing love and care, but they don't respond. The backstory is pretty heavy: the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug use when the author was 6, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted by a new family. The mom couldn't contact them until the author turned 18, and when she did, there were emotional conversations where the mom admitted to drug use during pregnancy and didn't know the author's father.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the author's actions. The author explains that they don't feel they can love their mom back because she's a stranger to them. They were raised by adoptive parents and have a traumatic history with the biological mom. The mom has shown remorse, but the author is struggling with trust and feelings. \n\nOn one hand, not responding to messages from a parent, even if there's a history of abandonment, could be seen as cutting off communication. But on the other hand, the author's experience with the mother is complicated. They were neglected and then separated, and the mother's actions had long-term impacts on their life. The author's decision to not respond might stem from emotional trauma, distrust, and not feeling ready to reconnect.\n\nThe key factors here are the mother's past actions, the author's emotional state, and the nature of their current relationship. The author isn't ignoring messages out of spite but due to deep-seated issues. The mother is reaching out, showing remorse, but the author feels they can't form a bond. It's a situation where the author is dealing with complex emotions and past trauma. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, while it's ideal to maintain communication with family, especially parents, the author's mental health and emotional readiness are also important. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being over responding to their mom. Given the context, it seems more like they're protecting themselves from further emotional harm rather than being inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have valid reasons rooted in their history and emotional struggles. The mother's actions in the past have left lasting effects, and the author's decision not to engage is a personal choice to cope with that history.\n"
