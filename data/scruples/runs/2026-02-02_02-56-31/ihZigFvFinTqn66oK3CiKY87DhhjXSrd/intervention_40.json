My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. Their mom had a troubled past, including arrests and addiction, leading to the user being placed in foster care. Now, the mom is reaching out, but the user feels distant and can't return the love.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was absent for a long time due to legal issues and addiction. The user was adopted and has a different family that raised them. The reconnection is recent, and the user is struggling with the emotional baggage of their past.\n\nThe mother's actions\u2014being absent, using drugs, not knowing the father\u2014have caused significant harm. The user's response is rooted in trauma and the need to protect themselves. They might not feel ready to reconnect emotionally. It's important to recognize that the user's feelings are valid given their history. \n\nHowever, the mother is now trying to be part of their life, and the user is avoiding communication. Some might argue that the user is being closed off, but considering the circumstances, it's a complex situation. The user isn't ignoring out of spite but due to unresolved pain. \n\nIn terms of social norms, forgiveness and reconciliation are often praised, but they aren't always possible or healthy. The user has the right to set boundaries. They might not be in the wrong for needing time and space. The mother's attempts to connect are positive, but the user's emotional response is also justified. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the user's actions are seen as selfish or self-protective. Given the trauma involved, it's more about healing than right or wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
