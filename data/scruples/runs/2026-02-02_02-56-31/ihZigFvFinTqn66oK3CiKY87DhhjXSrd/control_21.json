My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The background is that the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, and they weren't allowed to contact each other until the author was 18.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the author's actions. The mom was absent for most of the author's life, left them in foster care, and there's a history of neglect and drug use. The author's adoption by a new family might have given them a good home, which is important. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author feels disconnected. They mention that the mom doesn't know details about the author's paternity and other things, which adds to the emotional distance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. Emotionally, it's complex. The author might have trust issues or unresolved trauma. The mom is clean now and trying to make amends, but the author hasn't built a relationship with her. Maybe the author is angry or hurt. Not responding could be a way to set boundaries. On the other hand, some might argue that the mom is reaching out and deserves a response.\n\nBut considering the context of the mom's past actions and the author's feelings of being a stranger, it's more about personal boundaries and healing. The author isn't obligated to respond if they haven't reconciled their feelings. So, probably the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
