My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's backstory is important. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six. They were placed in foster care and adopted. After 18, the mom tried to reconnect, but the author found out she didn't know their father or nationality. The mom is now clean and religious but the author can't find it in themselves to love her back. They don't respond to her messages.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent, emotional readiness, and boundaries. The author was separated from their mother against their will, and when recontacted, they were not given a choice but to accept this stranger. The mother's actions in the past caused significant trauma. The author's decision not to respond is about setting boundaries to protect their emotional well-being.\n\nSociety often expects people to forgive and engage with family, but every person has the right to their own emotional boundaries. The author isn't ignoring random messages; they're dealing with a traumatic history. The mother's attempts to reconnect might be sincere, but the author isn't obligated to reciprocate if it's not healing for them.\n\nHowever, some might argue that communication is important even if it's difficult, but considering the context, the author is prioritizing their mental health. It's not about not caring, but about not being ready or able to engage in a relationship that's based on past harm.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a personal choice based on their experiences and emotional state. The answer should be B.\n"
