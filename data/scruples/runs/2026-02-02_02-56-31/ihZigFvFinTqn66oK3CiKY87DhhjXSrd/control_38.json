My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The backstory is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6. The author was in foster care and then adopted. They had no contact until the author turned 18. When they did reconnect, the mom didn't have answers about the author's biological father or nationality and admitted to using drugs during pregnancy. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author feels they can't love her back because she's a stranger. The author isn't responding to her messages, and the question is whether that makes them the asshole.\n\nHmm. Well, the author's perspective is that they've been hurt and neglected, and the mother's absence was legally enforced. The mother had serious issues that led to her being unavailable. The author is probably dealing with a lot of complex emotions\u2014anger, confusion, maybe even fear. They might not be ready to reconnect, especially since the mother's return hasn't provided the closure or answers they needed. \n\nThe mom, on the other hand, is reaching out, expressing regret, and trying to be part of the author's life. But the author's non-response could be seen as cutting off someone who is making an effort. However, considering the history of abandonment and the mother's past actions, the author's reluctance is understandable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a simple yes/no. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the mom is genuinely trying to repair the relationship, not responding might be seen as dismissive. But if the author hasn't healed from the trauma and isn't ready, it's about their emotional needs. Since the mother's actions led to the separation and the author is dealing with the aftermath, it's more about their healing process than being in the wrong. So, the answer is probably B (No), because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not responding given their history and emotional state.\n"
