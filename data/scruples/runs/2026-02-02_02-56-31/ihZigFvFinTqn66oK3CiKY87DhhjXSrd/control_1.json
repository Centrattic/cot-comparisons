My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the backstory is crucial. The author's mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six. She was forced to leave the state and couldn't contact them until the author was 18. That's a significant period of separation. The author was in foster care and then adopted by a new family, which they love. So, the author's early experiences with their birth mother are traumatic and legally enforced separation.\n\nWhen the mother reconnected via Facebook, the author was eager to learn about their heritage and identity. However, the mother couldn't provide the answers they wanted. She admitted to using crack during pregnancy and not knowing the author's father. That must have been emotionally devastating. Now, the mother sends texts expressing love and support, but the author doesn't respond, feeling she's a stranger and can't form love for her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not responding. The key factors here are the history of abandonment, the mother's past actions, and the author's current emotional state. The mother is now clean and trying to reconnect, but the author hasn't forgiven her. In their eyes, the mother isn't a real mom anymore, just a stranger. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't obligated to respond out of obligation. They have the right to set boundaries after such trauma. The mother's actions caused significant harm, and the author's decision not to engage could be a form of self-protection. While some might argue that ignoring messages is harsh, given the context of abandonment and betrayal, it's understandable. The author might be prioritizing their emotional well-being over societal expectations of forgiveness.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is making efforts to reconcile, which could be seen as sincere. However, the author's right to feel hurt and disconnected is valid. The situation isn't a simple case of ignoring a relative; it's about years of abuse, separation, and the struggle to reconcile a complex identity.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The author has every right to prioritize their mental health and not force themselves to respond if they aren't ready. The mother is in a position to reach out, but the author's boundaries are their own to set.\n"
