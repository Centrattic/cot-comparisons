My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom was arrested when the user was six for child neglect and drug abuse. The user was in a foster home and then adopted by a different family they love. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When they did, she reached out, but the user found out some hard truths about their background. The mom is now trying to reconnect, but the user can't bring themselves to respond.\n\nSo, the core issue here is whether the user is being unreasonable by not responding. On one hand, the mom is trying to rebuild a relationship after years of absence and mistakes. She's clean now and wants to be part of the user's life. But on the other hand, the user has been through a lot of trauma. They were taken from their mother, didn't know their real family for years, and now the mom is giving them mixed or incomplete information about their heritage. The user might feel betrayed or hurt because the mom wasn't there when they needed her and is only reaching out now.\n\nEmotionally, it's valid for the user to shut her out. They have the right to set boundaries, especially after such a long period of neglect and then unexpected contact. The user might not be ready to forgive or accept her back into their life. It's not just about being angry; it's about processing a lot of unresolved feelings. The user's adoptive parents are important too, and their support might be a factor here.\n\nBut then, maybe the user is being too harsh? The mom is trying to apologize and connect. Even if they can't love her back, is it wrong to ignore her? Maybe the user should consider at least acknowledging her efforts, even if they don't reciprocate feelings. Ignoring someone's attempts to rebuild a relationship could be seen as cutting off communication entirely, which might be seen as harsh. But if the user has valid reasons for not wanting to engage, they aren't the asshole for doing so.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the user's right to set boundaries based on their past experiences. The mom's actions in the past were harmful, and the user isn't obligated to respond. They're dealing with their own emotions and trauma. So, the answer would be that they're not in the wrong. They have the right to decide how and when to engage, if at all.\n"
