My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's love texts for four years. The backstory is pretty heavy. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, they were in foster care, then adopted. When they turned 18, mom reached out, but the conversation was awkward and left the user feeling more confused. Now, the mom sends messages, but the user doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user had a traumatic experience with their biological mother, which led to being separated. The mom's actions were harmful, and the user was left with a lot of unanswered questions. The user's adoptive parents are supportive. The user isn't rejecting love from their adoptive parents, but their biological mom's messages are difficult.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect, the emotional trauma, and the user's struggle with identity. The user is not ignoring the mom out of spite but because of unresolved pain and the fact that she's a stranger. The user's feelings are valid. The mom is trying to reconnect, but the user isn't ready. It's about boundaries and healing.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a matter of being an asshole. The user is dealing with complex emotions. The mom's actions in the past were wrong, and the user's response is a reaction to that. The user isn't obligated to respond to someone who was absent and harmful. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
