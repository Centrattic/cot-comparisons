My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. They have a complicated history: their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were 6, leading to their placement in foster care and eventual adoption. Now, after reconnecting via Facebook at 18, they're not responding to her messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their past trauma. The mother's actions had a significant impact on their early life, which is a major factor. The user feels they don't know her anymore and can't just reconnect as a mother. The mother is trying to reach out, but the user is struggling with forgiveness and trust. \n\nLegally, the mother couldn't contact them until 18, so there's a long gap where the relationship was severed. The user's emotional response is understandable. They might be dealing with anger, betrayal, and the struggle to accept a mother who contributed to their hardship. The fact that the mother is now clean and seeking reconciliation is noted, but the user hasn't healed from the past.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user isn't ignoring someone who was present in their life. The mother's absence and actions were the cause of the separation. The user's current lack of response might be a protective mechanism. They're not obligated to respond out of obligation, but maybe their emotional state makes it hard. However, the mother's outreach is genuine, and the user might need to find a way to heal, even if it's not through traditional mother-son love.\n\nThe key here is that the mother is the one who caused the initial trauma. The user's response is a result of that trauma. The question is whether ignoring someone who is trying to reconnect is wrong in this context. Since the user's behavior is a reaction to past harm, it's not necessarily their fault. They might need to work on their own feelings, but the blame isn't on them for not responding. So the answer would be B.\n"
