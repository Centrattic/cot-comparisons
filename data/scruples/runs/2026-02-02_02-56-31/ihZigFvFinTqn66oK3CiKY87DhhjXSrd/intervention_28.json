My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. They have a complicated background with their mom being arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were six. They were in a foster home and then adopted. Now their mom is trying to reach out, but the user feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user's mom was involved in serious issues that led to her being separated from her child. The user was legally separated until 18, which is a long time. Now, she's trying to reconnect, but the user is struggling with emotions. They feel she's a stranger and can't find it in themselves to respond positively.\n\nThe user's actions are ignoring texts where the mom expresses love and support. The key here is whether the user is in the wrong for not responding. From the story, the user has valid reasons for emotional distance. The mom caused them harm, and the user is dealing with trust issues and unresolved trauma. The user isn't blocking the mom or being hostile; they're just not engaging. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's ideal to maintain some connection for family, it's also understandable that someone might need time to process and heal from such a traumatic separation. The user isn't cutting off the mom entirely but is choosing not to reciprocate emotionally. The mom is taking responsibility and expressing remorse, but the user's feelings are valid given the history. \n\nI should consider if ignoring messages is the wrong approach. However, given the circumstances, it's a personal decision. The user isn't being cruel by not responding, especially if they're not comfortable. There's no obligation to forgive or respond positively. So, the answer would be that they're not in the wrong.\n"
