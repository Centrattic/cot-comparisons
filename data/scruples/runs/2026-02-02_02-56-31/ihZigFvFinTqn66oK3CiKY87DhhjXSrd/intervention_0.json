My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complicated. They were taken into foster care when they were six because their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug use. Then they were adopted by their current parents, who they love. After turning 18, the mom tried to reconnect via Facebook, but the user found out she didn't even know who their father was and was using drugs during pregnancy. Now the mom is trying to reach out again, but the user can't bring themselves to respond or show love.\n\nSo, the user is asking if they're the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure out which one fits better. \n\nFirst, the mom did some really bad things in the past. She was a drug user, neglected her child, and was away for a long time. The user was put into foster care and adopted, which is a big deal. The user has every right to feel hurt and disconnected. The mom's attempts to reconnect come after years of absence and with some shocking revelations. The user's response is to not engage, which might seem cold, but considering the history, it's understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom has been clean, found faith, and is trying to make amends. But the user hasn't seen her in over a decade, and she contributed to their traumatic past. The user's current parents are their real family now. The user's choice to not respond is more about protecting their emotional well-being. It's not about being a bad person but processing past trauma. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No). The user isn't in the wrong for not responding. They've been through a lot, and the mom's actions caused significant harm. The user's feelings are valid, and they're not obligated to reciprocate love unless they choose to in the future. The key here is that the user's actions are a result of their history and the trauma they experienced, not out of spite or meanness. Therefore, they aren't the asshole.\n"
