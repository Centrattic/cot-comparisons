My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not responding to their mother's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author was taken away from their mom due to her drug abuse and neglect when they were young. They were in foster care, then adopted by a new family. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. After that, she tried to reconnect, but the author found out she didn't even know who the father was and had a lot of unanswered questions. The author hasn't spoken to her since that initial contact and is now ignoring her messages, even though she's trying to be clean and is sorry.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for not responding? The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The mother made significant mistakes in the past, leading to the child being taken away. The child was then raised by adoptive parents. When contact resumed, the mother's lack of information and the emotional trauma could have made it hard for the author to reconnect. The author hasn't returned any messages, which the mom finds hurtful.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author has valid reasons for not wanting to engage. The mother's actions caused them harm, and the sudden contact after years of absence might be difficult to process. The author might still be dealing with unresolved trauma. On the other hand, the mom is trying to reconcile, and ignoring her could be seen as cutting her out completely. However, considering the history, the author isn't obligated to respond if they're not comfortable. The fact that the author hasn't spoken to her since that initial meeting and now is ignoring messages might be a way to set boundaries, which is okay. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own emotional well-being. So the answer is probably B (No).\n"
