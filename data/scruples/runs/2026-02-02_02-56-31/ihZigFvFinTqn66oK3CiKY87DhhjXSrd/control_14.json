My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's messages over four years. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a pretty serious history. She was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the child being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. The mom was cut off from contact until the author turned 18. When she reached out after 18, the author had a lot of questions about their identity and background, but the mom couldn't provide answers. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond, feeling that the mom is a stranger.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect and abuse, the forced separation, and the author's current emotional stance. The author isn't ignoring the mom without reason; they have a traumatic past and are struggling to reconcile their feelings. The mom, while clean and religious now, caused significant harm in the past. The author's decision not to respond is rooted in unresolved trauma and the inability to reconnect with someone who was absent for so long and caused harm.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a simple matter. The mom's actions in the past were definitely harmful, but the author's current choice to not engage might seem harsh. However, considering the context\u2014trauma, lack of a built relationship, and the author's emotional state\u2014it's more about their right to set boundaries. The author isn't obligated to forgive or respond; healing from such experiences takes time, and their feelings are valid.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're dealing with the aftermath of significant personal and family issues, and their decision stems from a place of self-protection and unresolved emotions. It's not a matter of being a jerk but needing space to process and possibly heal.\n"
