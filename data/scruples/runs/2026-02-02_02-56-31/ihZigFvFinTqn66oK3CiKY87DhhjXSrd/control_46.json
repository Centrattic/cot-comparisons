My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts. The situation involves a complicated history of child neglect, drug abuse, and separation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. The mother wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. Now, she's trying to reconnect, sending messages of love and support, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nThe author explains that they have emotional barriers because of the mother's past actions. They feel disconnected, as the mother couldn't provide answers about their heritage and wasn't honest about their father's identity. The author's adoptive parents are important in their life, and they're struggling with the idea of reconnecting with someone they see as a stranger who caused harm.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. On one hand, the mother is reaching out and expressing remorse. On the other hand, the author has valid reasons for not wanting to reconnect. They were abandoned, neglected, and their early life was traumatic. The author might not feel obligated to respond to someone who wasn't present in their life for so long and who caused them pain.\n\nSocial norms often encourage family reconciliation, but this isn't a straightforward case. The mother's actions had severe consequences, and the author's emotional response is a result of that trauma. The author is prioritizing their emotional well-being, which is important. It's also true that ignoring the messages could be seen as cutting off a parent, but given the circumstances, it's a form of self-protection.\n\nI should consider if there's any obligation for the author to respond. Since the mother was absent for so long and the relationship was severed legally, the author isn't under any legal or moral obligation to reconnect. The mother initiated contact after years of absence, and the author is within their right to decide how much, if any, contact they want.\n\nThe author's decision might be hurtful to the mother, but the author's well-being is a priority here. It's also possible that the author is still processing their feelings and hasn't been able to forgive their mother. The fact that the mother's presence in the author's life was traumatic means that the author's response is a natural reaction.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they are protecting their emotional health and have a history of valid reasons to be distant. The mother's actions in the past make it understandable that the author wouldn't want to reconnect immediately or at all.\n"
