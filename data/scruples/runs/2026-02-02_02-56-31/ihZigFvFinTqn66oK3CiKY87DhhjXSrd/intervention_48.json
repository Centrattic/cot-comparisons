My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're the asshole for not responding to their mom's messages over four years. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the user was six. They were in foster care and adopted by a new family. The mom couldn't contact them until they were 18, which is probably due to legal restrictions. When she did contact them, the user felt neglected and angry because the mom didn't know basic info about their father or nationality. Now, the mom is trying to reach out, saying she's clean and wants to be part of their life, but the user can't forgive her and isn't responding.\n\nSo, the user isn't responding to messages that show love and apology. The key points here are the mom's past actions, the user's feelings of betrayal and loss, and the current attempts at reconciliation.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Legally, the mom couldn't contact them, but once she could, she tried. She's showing remorse and changed her life. But the user has valid reasons for feeling hurt and disconnected. They were taken away, the mom didn't know their father's identity, and there's a lack of closure.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they're not ignoring her out of spite but because of unresolved trauma and emotional distance. They have a right to set boundaries and not be forced to reconnect if they're not ready. The mom, while trying to reach out, might not understand the depth of the user's pain. However, the user's refusal to acknowledge her over four years could be seen as cutting off family. But given the context, it's more about healing and personal boundaries rather than being an asshole.\n\nSo, answer B (Not in the wrong) makes sense here because the user has legitimate reasons for their actions, and it's their right to decide how to handle the relationship after such a traumatic experience.\n"
