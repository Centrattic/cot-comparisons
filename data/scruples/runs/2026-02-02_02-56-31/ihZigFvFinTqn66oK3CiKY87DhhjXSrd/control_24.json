My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. They had a tough childhood because their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were six. They were put in foster care and adopted by a new family. After turning 18, the mom reached out, but the person felt hurt because she couldn't answer their questions about their heritage and father. Now the mom texts them love messages, but the person doesn't respond because they can't find it in themselves to love her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions when the person was a child were legally problematic and caused lasting trauma. The person's decision to not engage could stem from deep-seated emotional pain and a lack of trust. They were neglected and abandoned, which is serious. The mother's current efforts to reconnect might be genuine, but the person isn't ready to accept that. \n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, cutting contact could be seen as a personal choice based on their past. They are not obligated to respond if it's harmful to their mental health. However, some might argue that ignoring messages, especially expressions of love, could be seen as harsh. But given the history, the person's actions are a form of self-protection. They're not the asshole for prioritizing their well-being after such a traumatic experience. The mother's behavior in the past was the main issue here, and the person is dealing with the aftermath. So, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
