My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. The author's mom had a troubled past, including drug abuse and neglect, and they were separated. The author was adopted by a different family and had a good upbringing. Now the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author can't bring themselves to respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a traumatic experience with their mother, who was absent for most of their life. The mother's actions were legally problematic, leading to the child being placed in foster care. The author's current lack of response might stem from emotional pain, distrust, or unresolved trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is trying to reach out, expressing regret and wanting to be part of the author's life. But the author feels she's a stranger now. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a straightforward issue. The author isn't necessarily being cruel; they might be dealing with complex emotions. Not responding could be a self-protective measure. However, some might argue that the mother is trying to reconcile and deserves a chance. But considering the history, the author's decision is understandable. They might need time and space to process their feelings.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's past actions, the author's valid emotional response, and the fact that the author was forced into separation. The author's lack of response isn't malicious but a reaction to their history. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
