My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The backstory is pretty intense. Their mom was arrested when they were six for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the kid being placed in foster care and then adopted. The adoptive parents are Native-American and African-American, which the user loves. After 18, the mom reached out via Facebook, and the user was curious about their identity but felt let down. Now, the mom sends messages but the user doesn't respond, feeling she's a stranger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user was taken from their mom due to severe neglect and drug use. The adoptive parents raised them, so the user's current family is there. The biological mom hasn't been part of their life for years. When they reconnected, there was unresolved trauma and unanswered questions. The user isn't responding because they can't feel love for a parent who abandoned them and caused harm. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they aren't ignoring the mom out of malice but because of deep-seated issues. The mom is trying to reconnect, but the user hasn't had time to process everything. It's a situation where the user's emotional boundaries are important. The mom's actions in the past were harmful, and the user is still healing. Choosing not to respond to texts isn't about being an asshole; it's about protecting their emotional well-being.\n\nThe key points are the history of neglect, the user's need for space, and the fact that the mother's actions were legally and emotionally damaging. The user's decision to not reciprocate messages is a personal choice based on their trauma. Unless they're actively harming the mom without cause, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
