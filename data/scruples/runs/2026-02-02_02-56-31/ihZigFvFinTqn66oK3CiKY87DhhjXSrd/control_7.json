My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not responding to their mom's texts. The context is that their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were 6, leading to them being placed in foster care and adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. After reconnecting, the mom is trying to rebuild the relationship, saying she's clean and sorry, but the person feels they can't love her back because she's a stranger now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The mom did abandon the child due to her own issues, which is a serious matter. The child was in foster care and adopted, which is a traumatic experience. Now, trying to rebuild a relationship after such a long time and under such circumstances is complicated. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite but because they can't get over the past. They're not responding to her messages of love and support because they feel it's a stranger reaching out, not their mom.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is trying to reconnect, showing remorse and seeking forgiveness. She's clean now and part of a church. But the author hasn't spoken to her since the initial contact. Not responding to messages might be seen as cold, but given the history, it's understandable. The author has every right to set boundaries and take time to process their feelings. They might not be in the wrong for not being ready to reconnect or show affection yet.\n\nBut is there an obligation to respond? If someone reaches out, even if there's a complicated past, maybe the author should at least acknowledge the messages. However, considering the trauma and the fact that the mother was absent for so long, maybe the author isn't obligated to reciprocate love. They're not the asshole for prioritizing their own emotional well-being. They need time and space to decide if they want to rebuild the relationship on their terms.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). They're dealing with the aftermath of abandonment and are not ready to reconnect. It's their right to set boundaries and not respond until they feel comfortable.\n"
