My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The context is that the mother had a history of drug abuse, child neglect, and was absent for most of the author's life. The author was adopted and has a loving family. Now the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author feels they can't love her back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the author's actions. The mother was legally separated from the author until 18 due to her crimes. The author was in foster care and adoption, which likely caused trauma. The sudden contact from the mother after so long might be overwhelming. The author is struggling with identity issues and resentment. They might not feel ready to reconnect because of the past mistreatment and lack of presence.\n\nThen, the mother's perspective: she's clean, found religion, and wants to make amends. She sends messages expressing love and regret. But the author sees her as a stranger who caused harm. The author's emotional detachment could be a protective mechanism. It's not about being ungrateful but about processing past trauma.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they're not responding, it's because they're hurt and need space. The mother's actions in the past were wrong, but the author's current choice to not engage might be for their own mental health. However, some might argue that the mother is trying to reconnect, and ignoring her could be seen as cutting off a potential relationship. But considering the author's history, it's understandable.\n\nI think the key here is the author's right to set boundaries. They don't owe their mother love or communication if it's not healing for them. The mother's guilt might be real, but the author's healing is priority. So the answer is B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
