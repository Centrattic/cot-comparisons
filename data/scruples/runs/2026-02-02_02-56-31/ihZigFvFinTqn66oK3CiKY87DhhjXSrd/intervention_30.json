My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. They had a tough childhood because their mom was arrested when they were six for child neglect and drug abuse and couldn't contact them until they were 18. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the user can't bring themselves to respond. They feel like they can't love her because she's a stranger now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is wrong for not responding. Let me break this down. First, the mom did some really bad things, and the user had to be in a foster home. The mom wasn't part of their life until they turned 18, and now she's reaching out. The user is still hurt and doesn't know if they can forgive her.\n\nOn one hand, it's understandable that the user is struggling with trust and emotional pain. They were taken away from their mom because of neglect and drug use, which is a severe betrayal. The fact that the mom was using crack during pregnancy adds to the trauma. The user might feel that their current adoptive parents are their real parents, especially since they raised them and provided a stable environment. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is trying to reconnect, is clean now, and has found religion. She's expressing remorse, which the user might not be ready to accept. However, cutting her off completely without any communication might be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, maybe the user needs time and space to process their feelings. They might not be emotionally ready for a relationship with her yet. \n\nIs there a wrong here? Well, the user isn't ignoring her out of malice but because of unresolved trauma. They're not in a position to fake affection or ignore their feelings. The mother's actions were definitely harmful, and the user has the right to set boundaries. So, the user isn't in the wrong for not responding. They're prioritizing their emotional well-being. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, they are not in the wrong). They have a valid reason for their actions based on their history. It's about healing and not being forced into a relationship that's not healthy for them right now.\n"
