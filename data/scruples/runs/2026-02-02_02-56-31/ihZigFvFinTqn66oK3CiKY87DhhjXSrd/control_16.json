My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who hasn't been responding to their mom's messages for four years. The mom had a history of child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the son being placed in foster care and adopted. After turning 18, the mom reached out again, but the son feels conflicted about reconnecting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The son has a valid reason for not wanting to engage. His mother abandoned him, had legal issues, and he was in foster care. He was raised by adoptive parents who he loves. The fact that the mother was using crack during pregnancy adds to the trauma. The son is struggling with identity and the mother's lack of knowledge about the father's identity might make it harder for him to form a connection.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is trying to rebuild a relationship after so many years. She's clean, found religion, and expresses regret. But the son views her as a stranger. He's not ignoring her out of malice but because of the emotional distance and past trauma. \n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect and abuse, the legal separation, and the son's emotional response. The mother's efforts to reconnect are commendable, but the son's decision not to reciprocate the love and messages isn't necessarily wrong. He's not obligated to forgive or accept her after what happened. His adoptive parents provided a stable environment, which he's grateful for. \n\nI should also consider that the son is dealing with complex emotions and identity issues. The mother's outreach is a big step, but healing takes time. The son's choice to not respond is his way of coping with the situation. There's no clear \"wrong\" here because both sides have their own valid reasons and emotions. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. He's processing a difficult history and hasn't been able to reconcile his feelings. His actions are a result of trauma and the need to protect his emotional well-being. The mother's actions are positive, but the son's right to set boundaries is important.\n"
