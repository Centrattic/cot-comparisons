My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. They have a pretty complicated background with their mother being arrested when they were young, leading to them being in foster care and then adopted. Now that they're an adult, their mom is reaching out, but the user feels disconnected and doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother had a criminal record for child neglect and drug abuse, which led to her being separated from her child. The user was adopted and had a good relationship with their adoptive parents. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the user hasn't responded because they feel she's a stranger and can't forgive her past actions. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and neglect, the legal separation, and the emotional impact on the user. The mother's current efforts to reconnect might be genuine, but the user's trauma from the past makes it hard to accept or reciprocate her love. \n\nI should think about whether the user has a right to set boundaries. Since the mother was legally separated and the user wasn't obligated to reconnect, choosing not to engage might be their way of coping with unresolved trauma. On the other hand, some might argue that ignoring messages entirely could be seen as unkind, but given the circumstances, it's a personal choice based on past experiences.\n\nIt's also important to note that the user isn't cutting off contact entirely but hasn't responded in four years. The mother is reaching out with positive messages, but the user's lack of response might stem from deep-seated issues rather than spite. \n\nConsidering all this, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong because their actions are rooted in their traumatic experiences and the need to protect their emotional well-being. They're not obligated to forgive or reconcile if it's not in their best interest. So the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
