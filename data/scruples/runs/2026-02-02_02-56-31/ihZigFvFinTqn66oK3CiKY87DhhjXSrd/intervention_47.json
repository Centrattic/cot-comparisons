My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complicated. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the user had a really tough childhood. Their mom was arrested when they were six for child neglect and drug abuse. They were put in foster care and then adopted by a couple they love. So the adoptive parents were their primary caregivers, and they probably have a strong bond with them. At 18, the biological mom reached out again after being cut off for years. She's trying to reconnect, but the user feels conflicted. They ask a lot of questions, but the mom couldn't answer them, which made the user sad. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and missing them, but the user doesn't respond, and they haven't spoken in a while. The user is wondering if they're the asshole for not responding.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of the mother's actions leading to the child being separated, the sudden reconnection after years of absence, the emotional impact on the user, and now the mom's attempts to reach out again. The user feels like a stranger to her and can't muster the love she wants. \n\nI need to consider if ignoring her is wrong. Well, the user isn't ignoring out of spite but because of deep emotional wounds. The mom did abandon them and had substance abuse issues, which is a serious matter. The user has a right to feel hurt and disconnected. The adoptive parents provided a stable, loving environment, so maybe the user isn't obligated to reciprocate the love from someone who caused them harm. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user should try to engage, but that might not be realistic. It's also possible that the user is still processing the trauma and needs time. The fact that the user hasn't responded could be seen as a self-protective measure rather than being inconsiderate. The mom is clean now and shows remorse, but the past can't be erased. The user's feelings are valid. \n\nSo, I think the answer would be B (No, they're not in the wrong). The user isn't obligated to respond if they're not ready. Their emotional response is understandable given the history. The mom's actions were harmful, and the user has the right to set boundaries. It's not about being an asshole but about healing from past trauma.\n"
