My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. They had a tough childhood because their mom was arrested when they were six for neglect and drug use. They were in foster care and then adopted, which they're okay with. After turning 18, the mom contacted them through Facebook, and they had some emotional conversations where the mom admitted her past mistakes. But since then, the user hasn't spoken to her and ignores her messages.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The user's mom was absent for most of their life due to legal issues and drug abuse. They were placed in foster care and adopted, which seems to have had a positive impact. The user is struggling with their feelings towards the mom now that contact is possible. The mom is reaching out, expressing remorse and love, but the user feels disconnected and doesn't reciprocate.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, it's understandable that the user is having a hard time reconnecting. Trauma and abandonment can create barriers to forming or re-establishing relationships. The user's feelings are valid; they might feel anger, confusion, or resentment. The fact that the mom didn't know the father or nationality adds to the user's sense of loss of identity.\n\nHowever, from a relational standpoint, ignoring someone who is trying to reach out, especially a parent, can seem harsh. The mom is expressing regret and trying to make amends. But the user has valid reasons for their distance. They're not obligated to forgive or reconnect, especially if it's not healing for them. The key here is that the user is prioritizing their emotional well-being. \n\nIn terms of societal judgments, people might have different opinions. Some might say it's harsh to ignore someone's attempts to reconnect, especially if the parent is remorseful. Others would argue that the user has been through a lot and isn't responsible for their parent's past actions. The concept of 'toxic' or 'unhealthy' relationships also comes into play here. If the user isn't ready to engage, they aren't in the wrong for not responding. \n\nThe mom's intentions might be genuine, but the user's experience is what's crucial here. They need to do what's right for themselves. So, in this case, the user isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They might not be the 'asshole' because their actions are a response to their own history and emotional state. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
