My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's texts for four years. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a complicated backstory. Their mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, leading to them being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. The mother couldn't contact them until they were 18. After turning 18, the author tried to connect but found out the mother didn't know things about them, like their father or nationality. The author now ignores their mother's messages, not returning any love or affection. The mom is clean, found religion, and wants to be part of their life, but the author feels she's a stranger.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not responding. The key factors here are the history of abandonment, the mother's past actions, and the author's emotional response. The author wasn't given a choice in being separated from their mother, and the mother's absence was forced by legal means. The author's current lack of response could be seen as a protective mechanism rather than a malicious act.\n\nOn one hand, some might argue that the mother is trying to reconnect and deserves some response. But on the other hand, the author has valid reasons for not being able to reciprocate. They were essentially denied a relationship for most of their life and are now dealing with the aftermath of learning about their mother's past. Trust and emotional bonds take time, if they can be formed at all after such a history.\n\nThe mother's actions were harmful, and the author isn't obligated to forgive or respond immediately. The situation is complex, and the author's feelings are understandable. They might be in a place where they can't form that connection yet. So, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not responding. The answer is B.\n"
