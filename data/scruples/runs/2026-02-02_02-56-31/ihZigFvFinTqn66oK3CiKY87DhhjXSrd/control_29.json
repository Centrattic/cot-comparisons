My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. Their mom had a complicated past with drug use and neglect, leading to her leaving when the person was 6. They were adopted and now have a close relationship with their adoptive parents. The mom reached out after 18, apologized, but the person hasn't been able to reconcile and hasn't responded emotionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person's mother abandoned them due to serious issues, and they were taken in by loving adoptive parents. The bond with the birth mother was cut legally for years. Now that the mom is trying to reconnect, the person feels conflicted. They see her as a stranger despite her efforts.\n\nIs it wrong not to respond? Well, cutting off contact can be a personal choice, especially given the trauma involved. The person might not be ready to forgive or form a relationship. However, the mother is reaching out, expressing remorse, and the person isn't acknowledging her feelings. But considering the history, the person's decision to not engage might be a form of self-protection. They might not owe the mother a response, especially if they don't feel safe or connected. But maybe there's an expectation to at least acknowledge her efforts, even if not reciprocating love. \n\nOn the other hand, the person has valid reasons for their feelings. They were neglected, their mom was absent, and now they have a life with their adoptive family. Not replying could be seen as necessary for their emotional well-being. The mother's actions in the past were harmful, and forgiveness isn't mandatory. \n\nThe key points are the history of abuse, the legal separation, the person's current emotional state, and the mother's attempts to reconnect. The person isn't ignoring her entirely\u2014maybe they're responding to messages but not with love. But the question states purposefully ignoring \"I love you\" texts. If they're not responding at all, that's different. However, given the trauma, it's understandable. \n\nI think the answer is B, not in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries and protect their mental health. The mother's past actions don't obligate the person to show love or respond. The effort to reconnect is there, but the person's right to decide their own emotional investment is valid.\n"
