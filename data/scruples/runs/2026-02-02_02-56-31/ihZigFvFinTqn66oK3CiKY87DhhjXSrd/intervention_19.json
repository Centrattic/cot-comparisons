My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom was arrested when the user was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The user was placed in foster care and later adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. Now, she's trying to reconnect, sending messages expressing love and missing them, but the user doesn't respond.\n\nThe user feels conflicted. They want to know about their heritage and the mother's side but are also hurt by her past actions. They feel she's a stranger and can't bring themselves to love her back. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not responding.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the user's feelings are valid. The mother's actions had a significant impact on their life. The user has the right to set boundaries, especially if they're not ready to reconnect. Ignoring messages might be a way to protect their emotional well-being. The mother's attempts to reach out are good, but the user isn't obligated to reciprocate if they aren't ready. The situation involves complex emotions and past trauma, so the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for not responding. Their decision to not engage is a personal choice based on their experiences. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
