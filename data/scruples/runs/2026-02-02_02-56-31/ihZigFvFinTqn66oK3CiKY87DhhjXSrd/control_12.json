My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. \n\nFirst, the backstory is crucial. The mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. The mother wasn't allowed to contact the author until they turned 18. After reconnecting, the mother shares emotional details about her struggles, including drug use during pregnancy, and expresses regret.\n\nNow, the author hasn't responded to the mother's messages. The key points here are the mother's past actions and the author's emotional response. The mother's neglect and the subsequent separation for years are significant. The author was taken from their mother and placed into a different family, which could have caused trauma. The author now sees the mother as a stranger despite her efforts to reconnect.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not responding. From a moral standpoint, the mother's actions were harmful and she left the author in a difficult situation. The author's decision not to engage could be seen as a protective measure, especially if they haven't forgiven her or feel ready to reconnect. On the other hand, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends and deserves a response.\n\nBut considering the context of the mother's past, the legal separation, and the author's emotional state, it's understandable that the author hasn't responded. The author isn't obligated to forgive or reconnect, especially if it's not in their emotional well-being. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
