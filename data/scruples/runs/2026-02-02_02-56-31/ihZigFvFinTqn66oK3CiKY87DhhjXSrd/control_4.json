My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's messages. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mother was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was put in foster care and then adopted by a new family, which they love. The mother wasn't allowed to contact them until the author turned 18. When she did, she reached out via Facebook, but the author found out she couldn't answer questions about their background or father. The mother admits to drug use during pregnancy and now claims to be clean and found faith. The author hasn't spoken to her since, even though she sends messages expressing love and wanting to be part of their life. The author doesn't feel they can love her back and hasn't responded for four years.\n\nSo, the key points are the mother's past actions, the author's trauma from being neglected and separated, the lack of closure or accountability, and the current emotional distance. The author isn't responding to texts that say \"I love you\" and other messages. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a moral standpoint, cutting off contact might be seen as harsh, but considering the history of abuse and neglect, it's a form of self-preservation. The mother's actions caused significant harm, and the author isn't obligated to forgive or respond. Also, the author is still processing this and hasn't had closure. The mother's attempts to reconnect might be genuine, but the author's feelings are valid given the past. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being cruel by not acknowledging any messages, even if it's a small gesture. But given the context, the author's actions can be seen as protective. They are not in the wrong for prioritizing their well-being after years of trauma. The mother's mistakes don't entitle her to immediate forgiveness. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
