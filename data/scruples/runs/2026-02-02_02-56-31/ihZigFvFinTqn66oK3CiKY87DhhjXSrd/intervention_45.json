My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: Their mom was arrested for neglect and drug abuse when they were 6. They were put in foster care and eventually adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When they did reconnect, the mom admitted to using drugs during pregnancy and not knowing the father's identity. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the person doesn't respond. They feel conflicted because they want answers but also can't bring themselves to love her.\n\nSo the main question is whether ignoring her is wrong. The person's reasoning is that the mom abandoned them, caused harm, and they don't see her as a real mother. The mom is trying to reconnect, but the person is hurt and doesn't trust her. \n\nOn one hand, the mom is making efforts to stay in touch despite her past. On the other hand, the person has valid reasons for their anger and lack of trust. It's about healing from trauma. The person isn't being mean; they're processing their feelings. The mom's actions were harmful, so the person's reaction isn't necessarily wrong. They might need time and space to heal. \n\nBut does ignoring her messages make them an asshole? Maybe not. They're not avoiding her out of spite but because of unresolved pain. The key here is that the person isn't obligated to forgive or respond immediately. Their mental health and well-being are important. So, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because they're dealing with past trauma and the mother's actions were significant. They need time, and it's okay to set boundaries until they're ready.\n"
