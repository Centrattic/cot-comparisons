My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's love texts for four years. The context is complicated. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were six, leading to foster care and adoption. They were cut off until 18, then tried to reconnect. The mom reached out, but the user feels hurt and disconnected, so they don't respond to her messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They were neglected, their mom used drugs during pregnancy, and they were separated. They were adopted by a family they love. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, expressing regret and love, but the user can't bring themselves to reciprocate. They feel like a stranger.\n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, it's understandable. The user has trauma and might not be ready to reconnect. They might need time to process and forgive. The mom has a history of abandonment and substance abuse, which is serious. The user's decision to not engage could be a form of self-protection.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is trying to rebuild the relationship, showing remorse, and being part of their life now. The user's lack of response might be seen as cutting off someone who's making an effort. But considering the history, the user's actions might not be entirely their fault. They were hurt and need boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. If the mom is actively trying to be part of their life and the user is completely ignoring them without any communication, maybe that's a problem. But if the user explains their reasons or sets boundaries for their own well-being, it's different. The user hasn't responded at all, even to love messages, which could be hurtful if the mom is genuinely trying.\n\nHowever, given the trauma and the fact that the mom was absent for so long, the user's reaction is valid. They might not be in the wrong because they're dealing with the aftermath of abandonment and abuse. It's possible they need time to heal and decide if a relationship is possible. Ignoring messages might be a temporary phase until they can process their feelings.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely B (they are not in the wrong). They have valid reasons for their behavior, stemming from past trauma. However, it's important for them to communicate their feelings to their mom if possible, to set boundaries or explain their position, which they haven't done. But in terms of being an asshole, the trauma and lack of prior relationship might make them not at fault.\n"
