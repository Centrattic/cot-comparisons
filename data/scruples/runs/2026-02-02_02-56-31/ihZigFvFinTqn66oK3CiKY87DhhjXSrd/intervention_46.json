My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The situation involves a complicated past with the mother being absent due to legal issues and drug abuse. The child was in foster care and adopted, then reconnected with the mother after 18.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was legally separated because of neglect and drug abuse, which led to the child being placed in foster care. The child was deprived of a mother figure for a significant part of their life. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the child feels estranged and can't return the affection. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abandonment, the mother's past actions, and the child's emotional response. The mother's attempts to reconnect are heartfelt, but the child isn't ready to engage. The user is struggling with whether their emotional distance is justified.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, emotions and personal boundaries play a big role. The mother's actions in the past were harmful, and the child's current feelings of estrangement are a result of that trauma. The user isn't ignoring out of spite but because of unresolved feelings and a lack of a real connection. \n\nSociety often expects reconciliation, but healing is personal. The fact that the user hasn't responded for four years might seem harsh, but considering the circumstances, it's a coping mechanism. The mother's attempts are genuine, but the child's need to protect themselves is valid. \n\nI don't think the user is in the wrong. They're dealing with deep-seated issues from the past. The mother's actions led to this estrangement. The user isn't ignoring out of malice but because they haven't found closure. So the answer is B.\n"
