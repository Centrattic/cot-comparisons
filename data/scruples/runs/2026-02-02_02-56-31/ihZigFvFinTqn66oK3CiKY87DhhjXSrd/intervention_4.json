My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. They have a complicated backstory involving their mother's past actions and their own adoption.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the user was 6, leading to the user being placed in foster care and then adopted. For years, they couldn't contact their mom until they turned 18. Now, the mother is trying to re-establish contact, expressing love and regret. The user, however, feels disconnected and can't return the love, hence the silence.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's past actions and the user's emotional response. The mother's actions were severe, leading to the user's early life being upended. The user's decision to not respond might stem from unresolved trauma, lack of trust, or feeling that the mother isn't truly part of their life anymore. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is reaching out, showing remorse and trying to mend the relationship. The user's silence might be seen as cutting off an apology or opportunity for reconciliation. However, healing from such trauma isn't linear, and the user's feelings aren't invalid. They might not be ready to engage, especially if the mother's presence feels intrusive or if they don't see her as a real part of their life.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? It's about whether they're obligated to respond. Since the user has a valid reason for their stance and the mother's actions were significant, the user isn't necessarily at fault. The decision to engage or not is personal. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). But need to make sure not to overlook the mother's efforts, but the user's right to set boundaries is valid here.\n"
