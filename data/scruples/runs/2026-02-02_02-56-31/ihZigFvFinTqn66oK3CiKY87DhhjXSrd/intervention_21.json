My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the mother was arrested when the user was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The user was in foster care and then adopted by loving parents. The mother couldn't contact them until the user turned 18. When she did, there was a lot of emotional stuff, and the mother admitted to drug use during pregnancy and not knowing who the father is. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the user can't bring themselves to respond. They feel like a stranger to her and can't love her back. The user is being asked if they're in the wrong for not responding.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of neglect and abuse, the forced separation, the emotional reunion, and the user's current feelings of being disconnected. The mother is trying to reach out, but the user hasn't responded. The user is struggling with their feelings and whether their lack of response is justified.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, people might say that family bonds are important, and you should try to maintain some connection even if there are issues. But on the other hand, the user has a history of trauma and a complicated relationship. The mother's actions when the user was a child had severe consequences, and the user's emotional response is valid. The user may need time, space, and closure before being able to engage. Also, considering the mother's past, the user might have legitimate reasons to be hesitant.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, if the mother is reaching out with good intentions, but the user isn't ready, that's different from being cruel or dismissive. The user isn't ignoring her out of spite but due to unresolved trauma and a lack of a real relationship. Therefore, the answer would be that they're not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to not respond right now. The mother might need to understand the user's boundaries and not take it personally. So, the answer is B.\n"
