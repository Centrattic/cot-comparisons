My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. The author didn't return love or messages, and the context is pretty heavy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the background. The mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, which led to the author being placed in foster care. They were separated legally and couldn't contact each other until 18. When the author turned 18, the mom reached out, but there were unresolved issues and the mom admitted to drug use during pregnancy. The author feels conflicted\u2014there's curiosity but also a sense of distance. Now, the mom sends messages, and the author doesn't respond. The question is if that's wrong.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that the mom was absent for most of their life, had serious issues, and now wants to reconnect. The author might feel hurt, betrayed, and not ready to engage. The mom, on the other hand, is trying to reconnect, expressing remorse and affection. But the author sees her as a stranger. The key here is whether the author's refusal to respond is justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's complex. The author has every right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic separation. The mom's actions in the past were harmful, and the author isn't obligated to respond. However, if the mom is genuinely trying to make amends and the author is completely cutting her off without any attempt to communicate or understand, maybe there's a lack of empathy. But given the author's experience, their hesitation is understandable. \n\nI should also consider if the author is being cruel by ignoring messages. The mom is reaching out, but the author has valid reasons to be distant. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being. They haven't been abusive; they're just not responding. The answer hinges on the context of past trauma and the right to set emotional boundaries. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
