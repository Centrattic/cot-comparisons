My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The scenario is pretty complex, so I need to unpack it carefully.\n\nFirst, the author's mother was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was put into foster care and eventually adopted by a different family. The mother couldn't contact the author until they turned 18, which she did via Facebook. When they reconnected, the mother apologized and shared her struggles with addiction, but the author feels unable to love her back and has stopped communicating. The author is now ignoring the mother's messages, and the question is whether they're wrong for doing so.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abandonment and neglect, the mother's criminal history and drug use during pregnancy, and the author's current feelings of estrangement. The author's adoptive parents are loving and have provided a stable home. The mother, though now clean and active in a church, is seen as a stranger by the author. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, people can have valid reasons for not reconciling with a parent who was absent and abusive. The author's trauma from being neglected and abandoned might make it difficult to form an emotional connection. The mother's actions, especially during pregnancy and leading to the child's removal, are severe. The author's decision to cut off contact could be a protective mechanism, not just stubbornness.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother has changed and is trying to make amends, so ignoring her entirely could be seen as unkind. But considering the author's perspective, they have every right to set boundaries, especially given the history. The fact that the author's adoptive parents have filled the parental role might make it even harder to accept the biological mother back into their life. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't obligated to maintain a relationship with someone who harmed them. The mother's actions in the past have caused significant trauma, and healing is a personal choice. The author's silence isn't just about ignoring messages; it's about processing deep-seated pain and deciding their own emotional boundaries. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, while some might call the author an \"asshole,\" others would understand the trauma and lack of trust. The decision to engage or not is up to the author, and their feelings are valid. The mother's attempts to reconnect are commendable, but the author isn't required to reciprocate if it's not healthy for them. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because their actions stem from a place of unresolved trauma and the need to protect their emotional well-being, given the mother's history of severe neglect and absence.\n"
