My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the background: The user was in foster care since age 6 after their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse. She wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. After that, she reached out, apologized, and they had a conversation where the user learned a lot about their heritage and her past. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and missing them, but the user never responds.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong for not responding. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. The user's mom made some serious mistakes, leading to their separation. The user was adopted and has a new family that cares for them. After reconnection, the user feels conflicted\u2014there's a desire to know their roots but also pain from the past. The mom is clean now and trying to reconnect, but the user can't bring themselves to engage.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, the user isn't responding to messages, but given the history, it's understandable they have unresolved feelings. The mom's past actions caused significant harm, and the user is still processing that. The user isn't ignoring her out of spite; it's more about emotional barriers and not feeling ready to reconnect. \n\nThere's no obligation to maintain a relationship if the person has caused serious harm. The user is within their rights to set boundaries. The mom is trying to rebuild, but the user isn't obligated to reciprocate immediately or at all. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). But maybe some would argue they should at least respond politely. However, considering the trauma and the user's emotional state, it's a personal choice and not a case of being an asshole. So I think B is correct.\n"
