My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The author hasn't returned any messages where the mom says \"I love you\" or sends birthday wishes. The background is that the mom was arrested when the author was six for neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being in foster care and later adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until age 18, and when she did, she admitted to drug use during pregnancy and wasn't sure about the author's father. The author feels conflicted because the mom is clean now and wants to be part of their life, but the author can't find it in themselves to love her.\n\nSo, first, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether they're the asshole (AITA) for not responding. Legally, the mom was involved in criminal activity, but that's past. Emotionally, the author has been raised by adoptive parents and has a complicated relationship with the birth mom. The author's reasoning is that the mom is a stranger, and despite her efforts, the author can't reciprocate love. \n\nIs it the author's fault for not responding? Well, the author has valid reasons for emotional distance. They were taken from their mom as a child, and the mom's actions led to their being in foster care. The author's adoptive parents raised them, so the bond with the birth mom is tenuous. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite but due to deep-seated trauma and unresolved feelings. The mom's messages might be well-intentioned, but the author hasn't been given space to process their feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being unkind by not acknowledging their mother's attempts. However, considering the circumstances\u2014abandonment, drug use, and the sudden re-entry into the author's life\u2014it's more about emotional boundaries. The author isn't obligated to respond to someone who caused them harm, even if that person is their biological parent. The author's priority is their mental health and well-being. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), because the author's actions stem from valid emotional reasons and past trauma, not malice.\n"
