My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is at fault for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a history of child neglect and drug abuse, leading to their separation when the author was 6. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. After that, there was a brief emotional conversation where the mom admitted her past and expressed regret, but the author hasn't spoken to her since, despite her continued messages. The author feels conflicted because they can't bring themselves to love her back, as she's a stranger now.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and neglect, the forced separation, the mother's past actions, her current state of being clean and seeking reconciliation, and the author's emotional response. The author hasn't responded to messages, which the mom might see as rejection. But from the author's perspective, they're dealing with trauma and a complex mix of emotions, including anger, confusion, and a lack of connection.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether they should be returning the mother's messages. Legally and ethically, people have the right to choose who they communicate with. The author isn't obligated to respond to their mother. The mother's actions in the past were harmful, and the author's decision not to engage could be a form of self-protection and a way to process their feelings. However, the mother is reaching out with apologies and attempts to reconnect, which might be seen as a legitimate effort. But if the author isn't ready to engage, that's their choice. \n\nThe situation is complex, but the author isn't being cruel or unkind by not responding. They're dealing with the aftermath of significant trauma and may not have the emotional capacity to reciprocate affection at this time. The mother initiated contact, but the author's right to set boundaries is important. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their emotional well-being after a history of neglect and abuse.\n"
