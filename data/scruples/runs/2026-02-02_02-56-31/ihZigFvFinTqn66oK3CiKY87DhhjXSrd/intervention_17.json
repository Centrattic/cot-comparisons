My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the mother had a history of child neglect and drug abuse, leading to her son being placed in foster care. The son was adopted by a new family, and the mother was legally barred from contacting him until he turned 18. When she did reach out, she was honest about her struggles and expressed remorse. The son now feels conflicted because he wants to know where he came from but can't bring himself to respond with love or engage further. He's been ignoring her texts for four years, even though she sends messages of love and encouragement.\n\nNow, considering the perspective of the mother, she's trying to reestablish a relationship after a long separation due to her past actions. She's clean, found religion, and is expressing remorse. From the son's side, there's understandable trauma and a lack of emotional connection. He was essentially erased from his mother's life for most of his childhood, and when she reappears, he's dealing with the aftermath of that absence and her past behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the son is in the wrong for not responding. Emotionally, the son has valid reasons to feel this way. The mother's absence and the reasons behind it (neglect, drug abuse) caused significant harm. The son's decision to not engage could be seen as a protective mechanism rather than a selfish act. However, some might argue that ignoring someone's attempts to connect, even a flawed parent, could be seen as unkind or dismissive.\n\nBut given the context of the son's trauma and the mother's lack of consistent presence in his life, it's more about his personal boundaries and healing process. The fact that she was a stranger to him until 18 and now is trying to rebuild the relationship might not be something he's ready for. The son's feelings of not knowing who she is and not being able to love her back make sense in the context of their history.\n\nSo, the answer here likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because his actions are a response to past trauma and the complex dynamics of reconnection after such a long separation. He's not ignoring her without reason; it's rooted in deep emotional issues and the need to protect himself.\n"
