My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong by ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for not returning love messages.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a very difficult childhood. Their mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, leading to their placement in a foster home and eventual adoption. The mother couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When they did reconnect, the mother admitted to drug use during pregnancy and not knowing the author's father. The author is now ignoring her messages, not responding to expressions of love and support.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's past actions and the author's current emotional response. The mother's history is severe\u2014child neglect, drug abuse, abandonment. The author was essentially taken away and placed with adoptive parents they love. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect after 18 years, but the author feels disconnected because she's a stranger. They haven't spoken in four months after the initial contact, and the author is ignoring her messages, not reciprocating the love.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Is the author in the wrong for not responding? The mother is expressing remorse and trying to reach out, but the author has valid reasons for not feeling connected. The author's adoptive parents are their primary caregivers, so it's reasonable they might not feel obligated to reciprocate the mother's messages. Emotional healing takes time, and the author might not be ready to reconnect. The mother's actions in the past caused significant harm, so the author's hesitation is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends and deserves a response. But given the history, it's not the author's responsibility to forgive or engage. The author is not in a position to be held accountable for not showing love to someone who abandoned them and caused trauma. The mother's actions were the initial wrongdoing, so the author isn't in the wrong for not reciprocating. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
