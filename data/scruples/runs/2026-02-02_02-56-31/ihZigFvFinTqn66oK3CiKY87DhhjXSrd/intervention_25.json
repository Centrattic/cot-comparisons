My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. They have a complicated background with their mom being arrested when they were six, leading to them being in foster care and adopted. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect after being allowed to contact them at 18. The user doesn't respond to her messages, and they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother had serious issues: drug abuse, neglect, and left the user in foster care. The user was cut off from her for most of their life, only getting to know her after 18. The mother's attempts to reconnect are met with silence from the user, who feels she's a stranger and can't find it in themselves to love her back.\n\nOn one hand, the mother is showing remorse, is clean, and trying to be part of their life. But on the other hand, the user has been through trauma and is dealing with the aftermath of abandonment and lack of parental presence. The user's decision not to respond might stem from deep-seated pain and a lack of trust. It's important to consider that healing from such a relationship takes time, and the user might not be ready to engage emotionally.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. If we answer A (yes), it might imply that the user should forgive and reconnect, but that's not necessarily realistic given the circumstances. If B (no), it acknowledges the user's right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic history. The user isn't ignoring her out of spite but because they haven't processed the past and aren't ready. It's about emotional safety and healing. So, probably B is the right answer here.\n"
