My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The mother was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was put in foster care and then adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine and African American family. They didn't have contact with the birth mom until age 18. After turning 18, the mom reached out via Facebook, and the author had to ask a lot of personal questions. The mother then admitted to using crack cocaine during pregnancy and not knowing the father's identity. The author hasn't spoken to her since and now ignores her messages, even though she's been clean and apologetic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the author's mom was a significant source of trauma. She abandoned them, had serious issues with drugs, and the adoption was a major life event. The author might feel a lot of anger, confusion, or betrayal. When the mom finally contacts them, she doesn't provide clear answers, which could be hurtful. The author's response of not engaging and not reciprocating love might be a way to protect themselves from emotional pain. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is trying to reconnect after 12 years, expressing remorse and has been clean. But the author might not be ready to accept that. The question is about whether ignoring her is wrong. The mom initiated contact, and the author is choosing not to respond. The author might have valid reasons for their boundary, especially given the history. \n\nThe community often looks at intentions. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite but due to past trauma and current emotional distance. They're a stranger, so expecting love might be unreasonable. The author's adoptive parents are loved, so maybe they feel their identity is tied to that family. Also, the mother's admission about not knowing the father's identity and her drug use during pregnancy could be a significant emotional blow, making it hard for the author to reconcile. \n\nBut some might argue that the author is being too harsh, that the mother is making amends and deserves a chance. However, healing from such deep-seated issues takes time, and the author's decision might be a necessary step in their healing process. It's about personal boundaries and emotional readiness. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because they have a history of trauma and the mother's actions had lasting effects. The author is prioritizing their emotional well-being by setting boundaries, which is a common and understandable reaction. The mother's efforts are commendable, but the author's right to choose their response based on their experiences is valid.\n"
