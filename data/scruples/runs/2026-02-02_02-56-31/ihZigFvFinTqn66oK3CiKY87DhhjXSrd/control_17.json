My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for 4 years. Their mom was a bad parent when they were a kid\u2014arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, had to leave the state. They were in foster care, adopted, and had a good life with the adoptive parents. Then after 18, the mom contacts them, but she doesn't know things about the person's father or nationality. The person feels hurt and can't return her love. They haven't spoken since that initial contact.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions were severe: child neglect, drug use during pregnancy, abandonment. The child was taken away and couldn't contact her until 18. Then she reaches out, but the child is still upset and doesn't want to reconnect. The mother is trying to be part of their life again, but the child is a stranger to them now.\n\nThe author isn't ignoring messages in a current relationship but in a situation where there's a history of abandonment and trauma. The author has valid reasons for not being able to reciprocate love. The mother's actions caused lasting harm. The author is dealing with their own emotions and trauma, which makes sense. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they have been hurt and it's reasonable to need time to process and not respond immediately, especially given the mother's past behavior. The author isn't being selfish; they're dealing with the aftermath of abuse and neglect. So, the answer is B.\n"
