My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the background: The author was taken into foster care when their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse. She couldn't contact them until they turned 18. After that, she reached out, but the author found out she didn't know their father and had other issues. Now she sends messages, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, from the author's perspective, their mom was absent for most of their life, had legal issues, and contributed to their being in foster care. The author feels hurt and disconnected, even though the mom is now trying to make amends. The author's response is to ignore the messages, which is understandable given the trauma involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is reaching out, expressing regret and wanting to be part of their life. But the author has valid reasons for not wanting to reconnect. They feel like a stranger and can't find it in themselves to love her back. The author isn't ignoring her out of malice but because of past pain and lack of a current relationship.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the context of abandonment and the emotional impact. The author isn't being cruel; they're protecting their own emotional well-being. So, the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
