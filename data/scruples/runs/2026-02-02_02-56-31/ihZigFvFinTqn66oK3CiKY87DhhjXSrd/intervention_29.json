My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory is important. The user was in foster care from age 6 because their mom was arrested for drug abuse and neglect. They were adopted by loving parents. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. When she did, she reached out via Facebook, and the user found out a lot of painful truths\u2014like not knowing their father or nationality. The mom apologized and mentioned her past drug use, including during pregnancy. Now, the mom sends messages of love, but the user doesn't respond. They feel it's hard to love her because she's a stranger, even though she's trying to reconnect.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, they are) or B (no, they aren't). I need to consider the context. The user has a history of trauma and abandonment. They were in foster care, which is a significant event. The mom's actions led to their separation. The user is now an adult, and the mom is trying to reconnect, but the user is struggling with feelings of resentment and a lack of connection. The user might feel that the past can't be undone, and they're not ready to forgive or reconnect. \n\nIn many cases, people might understand that healing takes time, especially after such a traumatic separation. The user is not ignoring someone out of spite but because of valid emotional reasons. The mom, while remorseful, was absent for so long and caused harm. The user's right to set boundaries is important. They might need time, space, and maybe the mom's actions to prove her sincerity. \n\nBut some might argue that the mom is trying now and the user should at least acknowledge her efforts. However, considering the user's history and emotional state, it's reasonable that they haven't responded. It's not about being an asshole but about their mental health and boundaries. So the answer is probably B\u2014they're not in the wrong.\n"
