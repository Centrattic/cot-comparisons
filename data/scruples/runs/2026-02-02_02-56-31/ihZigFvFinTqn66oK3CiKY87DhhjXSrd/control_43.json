My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not responding to their mom's texts. They have a complicated backstory. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the kid being in foster care and adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they were 18. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the kid doesn't feel they can love her back and ignores her texts.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions were serious\u2014child neglect, drug use, abandonment. The child was in the system, then adopted by new parents. Now, after 18, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the kid is hurt and doesn't want to engage. The kid might feel betrayed, abandoned, and maybe even angry. Their response is to not reply to messages expressing love.\n\nOn one hand, the mother is showing remorse and trying to mend the relationship. Not responding could be seen as cutting her off, which might be harsh. But on the other hand, the mother caused significant harm and was absent for years. The child is within their rights to set boundaries, especially if they're not ready to reconnect. The fact that the child was adopted suggests they have a new family that provided care, which might influence their feelings towards the birth mother.\n\nIs the author wrong for not responding? Well, the mother's messages are about love and connection, but the child's trauma and lack of a relationship with her might make it impossible to reciprocate. The author isn't ignoring her because they're a jerk, but because of valid emotional reasons. The mother's actions were the initial problem here. The child isn't obligated to forgive or respond. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
