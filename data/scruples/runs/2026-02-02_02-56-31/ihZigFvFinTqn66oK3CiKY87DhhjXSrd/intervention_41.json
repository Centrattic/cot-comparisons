My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex. Their mom had a lot of issues when they were a child, leading to being put in foster care and then adopted. Now that they're an adult, their mom has reached out again, but the user hasn't responded emotionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's background. They were in foster care due to their mom's neglect and drug abuse. That's serious. The user was adopted by a couple they love. Now, their mom is trying to reconnect, but the user feels disconnected. They don't reciprocate the love or respond to her messages. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and neglect, the mother's past actions, and the user's current emotional state. The user might have trust issues and feel that their mother isn't truly sorry or deserving of love. They might also be struggling with their identity and the lack of information about their biological father. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is trying to reach out, expressing remorse and trying to be part of the user's life. She's clean and found faith. But the user sees her as a stranger, which is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nIs the user in the wrong for not responding? Well, in terms of legal or social obligations, probably not. They aren't required to respond to messages from someone who abandoned them. Emotionally, it's a personal choice. They might not be ready to forgive or connect, especially after such trauma. \n\nHowever, some might argue that ignoring someone's attempts to connect, even if there's a history of issues, could be seen as cutting them off without giving a chance. But given the user's experience, forcing themselves to respond might not be healthy. \n\nThe answer hinges on understanding the user's right to protect their emotional well-being. They have a valid reason to feel the way they do. So, they're not in the wrong for prioritizing their healing and not engaging with someone who caused them harm in the past.\n"
