My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the person is asking if they're an asshole for not responding to their mom's love texts for four years. The background is that their mom was arrested when they were six for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to their placement in foster care and eventual adoption. They were only allowed to contact the mom after turning 18. When they did reconnect, the mom was apologetic but didn't have all the answers the author wanted about their identity and past. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and encouragement, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The mother's actions had a significant negative impact on the author's life, leading to separation and a lack of contact for most of the author's life. The author's decision not to respond could stem from unresolved trauma, anger, and a sense of betrayal. They might feel that their biological mother isn't truly part of their life anymore, especially since they were raised by adoptive parents who they love. The author might be struggling with identity issues and is still processing the information about their past.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother has reached out after many years, is clean, and is making efforts to reconnect. She's showing remorse and trying to be part of their life again. However, the author might not feel ready to reconnect. It's important to recognize that healing takes time, and not responding doesn't necessarily make someone an asshole. The author's feelings of not knowing their mother and not being able to form a bond could be valid. The mother is a stranger in many ways now, and the author's emotional response is justified given their history.\n\nThe key factors are the mother's past actions, the author's current emotional state, and the fact that the author hasn't engaged in direct communication. The author isn't cutting off their adoptive parents or being harmful; they're just not engaging with someone who had a traumatic impact on their life. It's not about right or wrong but about their personal boundaries and healing process. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding, considering the complex history and their emotional journey.\n"
