My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complicated. The user was in foster care and adopted because their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug use. They didn't see her until they were 18, and when they did, she couldn't answer their questions about their father or nationality. Now she's trying to reconnect, but the user can't bring themselves to respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. The mother's past actions led to the user being separated from her during childhood. The user was adopted by a family they love, which probably helped them heal. When the mother reappeared, she couldn't provide the answers the user needed, which caused emotional pain. The user is struggling to reconcile this history with the mother's current attempts to connect. They might feel betrayed or resentful, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is expressing remorse and trying to rebuild the relationship. She's clean now and found faith, which might be genuine steps toward change. The user's refusal to communicate could be seen as cutting off someone who's trying to make amends, but the user's feelings of her being a stranger might make it hard to respond.\n\nI need to weigh the user's right to their feelings against the mother's attempts to connect. The user isn't being cruel; they're just not engaging. It's possible that the user isn't in the wrong because their past trauma and the lack of answers have made it difficult to form a connection. The mother's actions in the past were harmful, and the user has the right to set boundaries. So, the answer would probably be B (No), they aren't in the wrong. They're dealing with complex emotions from a difficult past, and not engaging isn't necessarily wrong if it's their way of protecting themselves.\n"
