My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts and not returning her love. Let me start by understanding the context.\n\nFirst, the mom was arrested when the person was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. They were placed in foster care and adopted by a new family, who they love. Then, after turning 18, the mom contacted them through Facebook. The person wanted to know about their past, but the mom didn't have answers. The mom has since been clean and found religion, but the person can't bring themselves to love her back. They've been ignoring her texts for four years.\n\nSo the question is whether not responding or not showing affection is wrong. The person feels they're justified because of the mom's past actions and the emotional distance. The mom, on the other hand, is reaching out, showing regret and wanting to be part of their life. The person's response is to not engage, which the mom might find hurtful.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the person's right to set boundaries is important. They were neglected and abandoned as a child, which is a significant trauma. Not being able to reconcile with the mother might be a protective mechanism. On the other hand, the mother is trying to rebuild a relationship, and the person's silence might be seen as cutting off communication without effort to understand each other.\n\nBut in this case, the person has valid reasons for not being able to connect. The mother's actions in the past have caused lasting damage. The person's inability to love her back isn't necessarily a bad thing if it's due to unresolved trauma and lack of a real relationship. The mother's attempts to reach out are commendable, but the person isn't obligated to respond if they feel it's not healthy for them. So the person isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being.\n"
