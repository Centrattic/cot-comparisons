My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. From the story, they were taken into foster care at six due to their mom's actions, including drug abuse and neglect. They were adopted by a loving family and had a tough time with their biological mom's absence. When they turned 18, the mom reached out, but the user found out she didn't know who the father was and had been using drugs during pregnancy. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the user can't bring themselves to respond.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of neglect, the long-term separation, the trauma involved, and the user's current emotional state. The user feels that the mother is a stranger and can't love her back. The mother is clean now and wants to be part of their life, but the user hasn't responded. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit complex. The user has been hurt and has valid reasons for not wanting to reconnect. The mother did abandon them and was involved in harmful behavior. The user's decision not to respond might seem cold, but considering the background, it's more about self-protection and emotional healing. \n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since the mother's actions led to the separation and the user is dealing with the aftermath, their choice to not respond might be seen as self-preservation, not being in the wrong. So the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
