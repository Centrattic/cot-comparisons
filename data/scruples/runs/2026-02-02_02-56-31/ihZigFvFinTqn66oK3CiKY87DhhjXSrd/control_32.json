My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a lot of issues. She was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six. The author was put in foster care and then adopted. That's a lot of trauma. After 18, the mom tried to reestablish contact, but the author found out she didn't even know the author's father or nationality. The mom was using drugs during pregnancy, which adds to the hurt.\n\nThe author hasn't responded to her messages, even though the mom is clean now and expresses regret. The key here is the author's reasons for not responding. They feel disconnected, seeing the mom as a stranger. The author's adoptive parents are important in their life, which might influence their feelings.\n\nIs the author wrong for not responding? Well, the mom's actions in the past were harmful. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic separation. The fact that the author hasn't returned messages might stem from justified hurt and a lack of trust. People can have different emotional responses, and not everyone can forgive or reconnect immediately. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite but because of deep-seated issues. So, probably not in the wrong.\n"
