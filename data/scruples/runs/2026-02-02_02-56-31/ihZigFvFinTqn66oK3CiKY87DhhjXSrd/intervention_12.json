My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. They had a really rough history with their mom, who was involved in drug abuse and neglect, leading to foster care and adoption. The user's mom reached out when they were 18, but the conversation didn't resolve feelings, and the user hasn't responded since. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's mom had a criminal record and wasn't in their life for years due to legal issues. The user has trust issues and feels disconnected. They're not ignoring texts out of spite but because they can't forgive or connect.\n\nNext, the definition of an \"asshole\" here. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit often looks at intent and harm. If someone is hurt, the responder isn't necessarily an asshole if their actions are self-protective. The user's mom is reaching out, but the user hasn't been harmed by their decision to not respond. They're maintaining boundaries.\n\nAlso, the user's mental health and healing process are important. They need time to process their past. The mom's actions in the past are beyond the user's control, so holding onto anger isn't the same as being an asshole.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the user could try to reconnect for closure. But the user clearly states they feel a stranger and can't love her back. That's valid. The user isn't cutting her off out of malice; it's due to their history.\n\nSo, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The user's actions are a result of their traumatic experience and the need for personal boundaries, not an asshole move.\n"
