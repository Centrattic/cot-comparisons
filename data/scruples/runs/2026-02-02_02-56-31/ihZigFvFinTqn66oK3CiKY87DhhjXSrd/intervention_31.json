My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex with a lot of backstory.\n\nFirst, the mother was arrested when the user was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The user was in a foster home and later adopted by their current parents, whom they love. The mother wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. When she did, it was emotional, but the user found out she didn't know their father or nationality, which added to their distress. Now, the mother sends affectionate messages, but the user can't reciprocate love because they feel she's a stranger.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The options are A or B. \n\nConsidering the context, the user's actions are rooted in trauma and a lack of relationship. The mother's past actions led to a forced separation, and the user's current emotional distance is a result of that. The user isn't ignoring out of spite, but because they can't form a bond. The mother's attempts to reconnect are genuine, but the user isn't ready. \n\nIn such cases, it's about emotional response to past trauma. The user isn't being malicious; they're struggling with their feelings. So, they're not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
