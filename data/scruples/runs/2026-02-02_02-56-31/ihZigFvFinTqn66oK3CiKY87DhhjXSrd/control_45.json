My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The situation is pretty complex. The mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, leading to the author being placed in foster care and adoption. After turning 18, the mother reconnected but didn't provide the information the author was seeking, like paternity or their nationality. The mother is now clean and religious but the author feels no connection, viewing her as a stranger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. The mother was legally barred from contact until the author was 18. That's a significant barrier. The author's lack of response might seem cold, but given the history of abandonment and the mother's inability to provide answers, it's understandable. The author has built their life with an adoptive family, which is crucial for their identity. The mother's return after so many years might not be enough to bridge the emotional gap caused by her past actions.\n\nThe mother's attempts to reconnect are genuine, but the author's trauma and the lack of a real relationship might mean that expecting a response is unreasonable. The author isn't ignoring the mother out of spite but because they can't form a bond with someone who was absent for so long and didn't fulfill her role as a parent. The question is whether the author is being an asshole for not responding. Considering the circumstances, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author's actions are rooted in personal trauma and a justified need to protect their emotional well-being. The mother's role in their life was severed legally and emotionally, so expecting immediate reconciliation isn't fair. The author isn't obligated to reciprocate love without a foundation of trust and presence.\n"
