My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the user was in foster care and adopted because their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse. She couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When she did reach out, the user had a lot of questions but felt let down because the mom didn't know things about their father or heritage. The user hasn't spoken to her since, even though she's trying to reconnect, being clean and going to church. But the user can't bring themselves to respond.\n\nSo, the question is whether not responding makes the user the asshole. From what I gather, the user has valid reasons for their anger and hurt. Their mom was absent due to serious issues, and when she reappeared, it didn't provide the closure or answers they needed. The user is now an adult, and choosing to not engage could be seen as a way to protect their own emotional well-being. \n\nBut maybe some people might argue that the mom is trying to make amends, and the user should at least acknowledge her efforts. However, given the history, it's understandable that the user is estranged. The key points here are the mom's past actions, the sudden reconnection without real answers, and the user's emotional response. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, not in the wrong). The user has every right to feel hurt and to set boundaries. They're not obligated to forgive or respond if they're not ready. The mom's actions caused significant harm, and the user's reaction is a form of self-preservation. Others might judge, but from an ethical standpoint, the user isn't the asshole here.\n"
