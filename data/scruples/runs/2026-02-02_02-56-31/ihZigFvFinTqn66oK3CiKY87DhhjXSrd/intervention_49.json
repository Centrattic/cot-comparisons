My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The context is pretty heavy.\n\nFirst, the mom was involved in criminal activity when the user was a child\u2014arrested for neglect and drug abuse. The user was in foster care and then adopted by a different family, which they love. After 18, the mom reconnected, but there's a lot of unresolved stuff. The user is still struggling with their feelings towards her, and they don't respond to her messages, even though she's trying to be part of their life now.\n\nThe user's main point is that they can't love her back because she's a stranger. The mom sent \"I love you\" texts, but the user doesn't reciprocate. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for this.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the user has valid reasons for not feeling connected. The mother's past actions led to the separation, and the user is dealing with the aftermath. The user hasn't blocked her, just isn't responding. It's their right to set boundaries, especially given the trauma and lack of a real relationship. The mother is trying to reach out, but the user has the autonomy to decide how much interaction they want.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is genuinely trying to reconnect, showing remorse. But the user isn't obligated to forgive or respond. Their emotional response is justified given their history. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
