My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years and not returning her love.\n\nFirst, the background: The person had a very traumatic experience. Their mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were 6. They were placed in foster care and eventually adopted. The mother couldn't contact them until they turned 18. After that, she reached out, but the reunion was painful because the mother couldn't answer basic questions about the person's father or heritage. The mother now messages regularly, but the child feels they can't reciprocate love because their mom is a stranger and the past trauma is too fresh.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the mother's history of abuse and neglect, the forced separation, the lack of closure or explanation for years, and the emotional impact on the child. The mother's current actions might be genuine, but the child's struggle is valid given the past. Healing takes time, and the child's decision to not engage could be a protective mechanism. The mother's messages might come off as insincere or triggering, especially if the child feels she can't be trusted. The fact that the child has a loving adoptive family also plays a role in their current sense of identity and security.\n\nConsidering all this, it's not about whether the mother's intentions are good now, but about the child's right to set boundaries after trauma. The child hasn't cut her off entirely; they're just not responding. That's their choice, and society might not judge that as wrong, especially without understanding the full context. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
