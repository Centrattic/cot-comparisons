My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person's mom was arrested when they were six for child neglect and drug abuse, which led to the child being in a foster home and then adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they were 18. After turning 18, the mom reached out, they had a conversation where the mom admitted to drug use during pregnancy and not knowing the child's father, and now she's clean and trying to reconnect. The person hasn't responded to her messages for four years and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the mother's past actions and the child's current feelings. The mother's abandonment and substance abuse during pregnancy are significant. The child was taken away and placed in a different family, which shows the legal system's involvement due to the mother's actions. The mother's return after 18 years is a big change, but the child has valid reasons for not wanting to reconnect. The child feels the mother is a stranger and can't find it in themselves to love her back. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the mother's actions were harmful and led to the child's separation. The child's non-response could be seen as justified given the trauma and lack of prior relationship. However, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends and deserves a chance. But considering the child's right to set boundaries and protect their emotional well-being, it's reasonable for them to distance themselves. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite but because of unresolved pain and a lack of connection. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
