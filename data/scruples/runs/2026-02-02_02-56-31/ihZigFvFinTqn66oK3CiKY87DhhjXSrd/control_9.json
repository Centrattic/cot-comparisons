My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone not responding to their mother's love texts for four years. The background is that the mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the person was 6, leading to the child being placed in foster care and adoption. After turning 18, the mother reconnected, but the person hasn't been able to reconcile and stops responding to her messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's past actions were severe\u2014child neglect, drug abuse during pregnancy, which directly affected the child's life. The child was taken away and placed in a different home, so the mother wasn't involved in their upbringing. The emotional impact of that separation is significant. The person might feel hurt, anger, or confusion, making it hard to accept or reciprocate the mother's love now.\n\nThe mother is expressing remorse, but the person doesn't feel the same. The question is whether not responding is wrong. In some cases, cutting off contact or not engaging can be seen as a self-protective measure, especially if there's unresolved trauma. However, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends and deserves a response, regardless of the past. \n\nBut given the history, the person's reaction is understandable. They might not be ready to forgive or reconnect. Emotions here are complex. The answer would likely lean towards the person not being in the wrong (B), as they have valid reasons for their feelings and actions based on their traumatic past. The mother's intentions might be good, but the child's response is a result of deep-seated pain and the reality of their history.\n"
