My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person hasn't responded to their mom's texts for four years. Their mom sends messages of love and support, but they don't reply. The backstory is that the mom was arrested when the person was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, which led to the child being placed in foster care and then adopted by a new family. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18, and when she did, there was a lot of emotional stuff revealed, like not knowing the father's identity or nationality, and the mom had been using crack during pregnancy. Now the mom is clean and trying to reconnect, but the author hasn't responded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They were neglected and abandoned by their mother, which caused a lot of trauma. The sudden reconnection after so many years might be triggering. The author might feel that their mother isn't a real mom because of the years of absence and the harmful actions. They might be struggling with trust and emotions, leading them to cut off communication. In many cases, people who've experienced such trauma might need time to process and might not be ready to reconnect, even if the parent is remorseful. The author's right to set boundaries is important here. They are not obligated to respond or forgive.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is trying to reach out and express love, which is commendable. She's acknowledging her past mistakes and wants to be part of the author's life. However, the author's actions (not responding) could be seen as ignoring a relationship attempt. But given the history, it's more about the author's need for space and healing. Society often judges people for not being \"nice\" or \"responsive,\" but in cases of neglect and abuse, the child's response is a valid reaction to past trauma. The author isn't being cruel without reason; they're processing a complex situation. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because their response is a result of justified emotional boundaries after experiencing significant trauma and abandonment.\n"
