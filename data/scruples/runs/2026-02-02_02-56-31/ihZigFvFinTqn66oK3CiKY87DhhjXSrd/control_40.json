My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's love texts for four years. The backstory is pretty intense. Their mom was arrested when they were six for neglect and drug abuse, leading to the child being fostered and adopted. The adoptive parents are loved, and the biological mom was cut off from contact until the child was 18.\n\nSo, the person reconnected with their mom after 18, but there's a lot of emotional baggage. The mom admits to using crack cocaine during pregnancy, doesn't know the child's father, etc. The person feels a lot of anger and confusion. They haven't spoken to her since the initial contact, but the mom keeps reaching out with love messages. The person hasn't responded because they can't find it in themselves to love her back, seeing her as a stranger.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abandonment, abuse, and the fact that the mother's actions led to the child being separated from her. The child was legally prohibited from contacting her until adulthood, so there's a lack of ongoing relationship. The mother's actions caused significant trauma, and the person is struggling with forgiveness and reconciliation.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, can someone be blamed for not being able to reciprocate love after such a traumatic experience? The person is prioritizing their emotional well-being. The mother's attempts to reconnect might be seen as genuine, but the child's right to set boundaries is important. The fact that the mother caused harm and then reentered the life without a stable relationship makes the situation complex.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding. They have a valid reason rooted in their past. The mother's actions were harmful, and the child's inability to show love back is a result of that trauma. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
