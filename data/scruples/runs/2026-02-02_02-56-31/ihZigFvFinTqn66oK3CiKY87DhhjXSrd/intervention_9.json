My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. Their mom had a history of drug abuse and neglect, leading to their placement in foster care. They were adopted by a new family and now feel conflicted about reconnecting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The mother's past actions were harmful and had legal consequences, which caused the child to be separated. The child was in a good adoptive home. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the child feels no love because of the past. \n\nThe person hasn't responded to their mom's messages. They explain that they're struggling with the fact that their mom doesn't know their father and wasn't there for them. They feel like a stranger to her. The key question is whether the person is in the wrong for not responding.\n\nFrom one angle, the mother is trying to make amends and express love. Not responding might seem harsh. But from another angle, the child's trauma and the mother's past actions caused significant harm. The child's emotional distance is understandable given the history. They were forced to have no contact until 18, which is a long time. Rebuilding trust isn't easy, and the child's feelings of being a stranger to their mom are valid. \n\nAlso, the person isn't cutting off contact out of spite but because of unresolved issues and lack of love. The mother's actions were a major part of their life, and the child's current stance is about self-protection and emotional healing. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their actions based on their past experiences. However, it's a sensitive situation where empathy is needed for both sides. The mother is trying, but the child's feelings aren't invalid.\n"
