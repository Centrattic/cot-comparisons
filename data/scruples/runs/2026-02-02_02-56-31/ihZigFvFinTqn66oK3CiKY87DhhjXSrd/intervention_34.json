My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages over four years. The backstory is pretty heavy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation fully. The user was in foster care after their mom was arrested for neglect and drug abuse. She couldn't contact them until they turned 18. Now, she's trying to reconnect, but the user can't bring themselves to respond. \n\nThe main issue here is the emotional distance. The user has a valid reason for not wanting to engage\u2014years of abandonment, the trauma of being in foster care, and the sudden re-entry of someone who wasn't present in their life. The mother's actions were harmful, and it's understandable that the user would struggle with forgiveness or acceptance.\n\nThe user is using \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), which typically looks for whether the person's actions were inconsiderate or wrong. In this case, the user isn't acting out of malice. They're dealing with unresolved trauma and emotional barriers. The mother initiated contact after years of absence, but the user isn't obligated to respond immediately or at all. \n\nThere's also the aspect of emotional readiness. Healing from such a situation takes time. Not replying to messages doesn't mean they're cruel; it could be a self-protective measure. The mother's messages might be genuine, but the user is still processing their feelings. \n\nAnother point is that the user has a supportive adoptive family, which probably played a significant role in their upbringing. Their current emotional state might be influenced by the contrast between that stability and the mother's troubled past.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their actions. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
