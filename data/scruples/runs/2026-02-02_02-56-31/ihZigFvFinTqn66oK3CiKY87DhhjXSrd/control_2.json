My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's messages for four years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was taken from their mother at a young age due to her legal issues and drug abuse. They were placed in foster care and then adopted by a different family. The mother couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When she did reach out, the author wanted answers about their background, but the mother couldn't provide much. Now, the mother sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond, feeling she's a stranger and can't form a bond. The author is asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for not responding.\n\nSo, the key points are the history of the mother's neglect and addiction, the sudden contact after years of separation, the author's emotional struggle with identity and loss, and the current situation of not responding to the mother's messages. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, but morally? Well, the mother is trying to reconnect after a long time, but the author has valid reasons for not wanting to engage. The author's trauma and lack of relationship could make it reasonable not to respond. On the other hand, some might argue that even if there's anger or distance, acknowledging the mother's attempts could be considerate. However, given the circumstances\u2014abandonment, abuse, and being a stranger\u2014it's more about the author's right to set boundaries. The author isn't obligated to have a relationship with someone who wasn't present in their life. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. They're dealing with the aftermath of a painful past and have the right to decide their level of engagement.\n"
