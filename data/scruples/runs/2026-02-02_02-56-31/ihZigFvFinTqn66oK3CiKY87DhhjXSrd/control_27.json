My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's love texts for four years. The author had a pretty rough backstory with their mom being incarcerated for child neglect and drug use when they were young. They were adopted and raised by a different family, which they love. After turning 18, they tried to reconnect with their birth mom, but found out she didn't know much about their father or their background. Since then, the mom has been reaching out, expressing regret and love, but the author hasn't responded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's mom made serious mistakes that led to their separation from the author during childhood. The author was in a foster home and then adopted, which probably had a significant impact on their life. The author is now an adult and has a right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic history. The mom, on the other hand, is trying to reconnect and express her feelings, which is understandable given her regret.\n\nBut the author feels that their mom is a stranger, and the pain from the past is still there. The author hasn't returned any messages or shown affection, even though the mom is clean and has found religion. Is the author in the wrong for not responding? Well, the author isn't obligated to have a relationship with someone who abandoned them and caused them harm. Emotional healing takes time, and it's valid for the author to need space. The fact that they even considered the situation and posted here shows some level of empathy, but their actions are a personal choice based on their history.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends and deserves a chance. However, given the circumstances, the author's decision to not engage isn't necessarily wrong. They have the right to prioritize their own emotional well-being. The mother's actions in the past had long-term consequences, so the author isn't obligated to reciprocate love or messages. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
