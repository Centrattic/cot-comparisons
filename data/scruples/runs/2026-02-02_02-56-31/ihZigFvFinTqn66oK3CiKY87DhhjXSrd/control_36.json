My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not responding to their mom's love texts for four years. \n\nFirst, the backstory is important. The person had a really rough childhood. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were six, leading to them being put in foster care. They were adopted by a different family, which they love. The mom was cut off legally and couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When they did reconnect, the mom admitted to using crack during pregnancy and not knowing the father of any of her kids. The user is still struggling to forgive her and hasn't responded to her messages.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the user is in the wrong for not responding. On one hand, the mom is trying to rebuild a relationship, and not responding could be seen as cutting her off. But on the other hand, the user has a valid history of trauma and neglect. They were essentially abandoned and have every reason to be hurt and angry. The user might not feel safe or ready to reconnect, and not responding isn't the same as being mean; it's more about emotional boundaries.\n\nThe mom's actions in the past were harmful, and the user isn't obligated to show love or respond if they don't feel it. Healing takes time, and the user is dealing with a lot of unresolved issues. The fact that they even consider the question shows some conflict, but their right to prioritize their emotional well-being is key here. So, it's not that they're in the wrong for not responding. They have every right to take their time, especially given the history.\n"
