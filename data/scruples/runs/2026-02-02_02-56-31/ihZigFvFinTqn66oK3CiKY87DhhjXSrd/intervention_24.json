My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The situation is complicated with a history of their mother's neglect and drug abuse, leading to the user being placed in foster care. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the user feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was arrested for serious issues, which caused the child to be separated at a young age. The user was adopted by a new family, which has been supportive. Now, the mother is reaching out, expressing remorse and wanting to reconnect, but the user is hesitant because they see her as a stranger. The user hasn't responded to her messages, including her expressions of love and support.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, cutting off contact might seem harsh, but given the history, the user's feelings are valid. They might need time to process and build trust. The mother's actions in the past have caused significant trauma, so the user's reluctance isn't unfounded. However, the mother is now clean, seeking faith, and wants to make amends. The user's silence could be seen as not giving her a chance, but they have the right to set boundaries based on their past experiences.\n\nI should consider the principles of empathy and understanding. The user's right to emotional safety is important. They might not be ready to engage, and that's okay. The mother's outreach is positive, but the user isn't obligated to reciprocate immediately. It's about mutual respect. The user isn't ignoring her out of spite but because of unresolved trauma. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). They're not being an asshole for prioritizing their emotional well-being.\n"
