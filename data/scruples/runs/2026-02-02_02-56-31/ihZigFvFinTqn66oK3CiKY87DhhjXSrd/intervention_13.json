My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they haven't been responding to their mom's messages for four years. Their mom sends love texts, birthdays, etc., but they don't reply. The backstory is pretty heavy\u2014mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, they were in foster care, adopted, and then mom reached out after 18. The person is struggling with whether they're being an asshole or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom did some serious stuff when the person was a child. She wasn't around, had legal issues, and admitted to drug use during pregnancy. That's a lot for a kid to process. Now that she's trying to reconnect, but the person feels she's a stranger and can't find it in themselves to love her back. \n\nThe question is whether not responding is being an asshole. On one hand, cutting off communication completely might seem harsh, but on the other, considering the history, it's a way to protect their emotional well-being. The person might be dealing with trauma and unresolved feelings. Not responding could be a self-protective mechanism. Also, the mom didn't know the father or nationality, which adds to the confusion and sense of loss. \n\nIs there an obligation to respond? Maybe in some cases, but if the person isn't ready, maybe not. It's their choice how to handle their emotions and relationships. The mom is clean and trying now, but the past can't be undone. The person isn't in the wrong if they need space to process and heal. So perhaps the answer is B, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
