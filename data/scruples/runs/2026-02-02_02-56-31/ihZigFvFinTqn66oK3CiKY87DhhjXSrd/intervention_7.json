My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user's mom was arrested when they were six for child neglect and drug use. She left the state and couldn't contact them until they turned 18. The user was adopted by a new family and had a pretty decent upbringing. After turning 18, the mom reached out via Facebook, and the user felt confused and hurt because the mom didn't know their father or nationality. The user hasn't spoken to her since, even though the mom is now clean and trying to reconnect. The user doesn't feel they can love her back and ignores her messages.\n\nNow, to determine if the user is in the wrong (A or B). The key points are the mom's past actions leading to the child being separated, the lack of contact for years, and the child's emotional response. The user is struggling with whether ignoring the mom is justified.\n\nIn situations like this, it's important to consider the context. The mom did lose custody and couldn't contact them, which is a legal matter. Now, she's trying to reconnect, but the user has valid reasons for not wanting to engage. The user's feelings are understandable given the history. They might not be in the wrong for not responding, given the lack of a nurturing relationship in the past. However, some might argue that the mom is making amends and deserves a chance. But considering the user's trauma and the fact that the mom abandoned them, the user's choice to not respond might be seen as a self-protective measure. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
