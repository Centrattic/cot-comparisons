My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The context is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the mom was arrested when the user was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The kid was put in foster care and adopted by a new family. Then, after 18, the mom contacts them via Facebook. The user wanted to know their background, but the mom didn't have answers. The user feels hurt and can't find love for her, so they don't respond to her messages.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The options are A or B. \n\nI need to consider the situation from both sides. The mom did abandon them and has a history of drug abuse. The user has a valid reason to feel hurt and disconnected. They were taken away as a child, and now she wants a relationship after so long. The user's adoptive parents are important too. The user might have a right to set boundaries, especially if they're not ready to reconnect. \n\nBut on the other hand, the mom is reaching out, showing remorse, and trying to be part of their life. However, the user isn't obligated to respond if they don't feel comfortable. The key here is the user's emotional state and their right to prioritize their healing. \n\nI think the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The user has been through trauma and might need time. They aren't obligated to reciprocate if they haven't healed. The mom's actions in the past don't require the user to forgive or respond immediately. It's about their emotional well-being.\n"
