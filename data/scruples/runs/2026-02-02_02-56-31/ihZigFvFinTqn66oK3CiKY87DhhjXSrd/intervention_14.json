My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's love texts for four years. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The user was in foster care after their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse. They were adopted by a new family and have a good relationship with them. At 18, the mom reached out, apologized, and the user learned more about their past. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and missing them, but the user doesn't respond. They feel conflicted because they don't know who their mom is anymore.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not responding. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to decide based on the details provided.\n\nKey points to consider: The user's mom had a significant past that led to the child being separated. The user has built a life with a new family. Reconnecting after so long brings up a lot of unresolved feelings. The user's reluctance isn't about ignoring love but about not being able to reconcile the mother's past with the current relationship. They aren't cutting her off completely but aren't reciprocating emotions because they feel disconnected.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, not responding to messages isn't inherently wrong. The user has valid reasons rooted in their history. They're not being cruel, just emotionally distant. The mother's actions in the past were harmful, and the user's emotional response is a result of that trauma. People need time to process such things. The user isn't rejecting love but hasn't found a way to reconnect yet. So, the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
