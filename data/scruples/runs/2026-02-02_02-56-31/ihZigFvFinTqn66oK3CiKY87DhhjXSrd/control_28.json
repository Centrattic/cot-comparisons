My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they should be answering their mom's messages. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author was taken from their mom when they were 6 due to her drug abuse and neglect. They were in foster care and adopted by a different family. Then, after 18, they tried to reconnect with their mom. She sent texts expressing love and missing them, but the author hasn't responded for four years. The author is struggling with feelings of anger and not knowing how to feel, given their mom's past and the sudden contact after so long.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect and abuse, the forced separation, the sudden contact after years of no communication, and the emotional impact on the author. The mom's actions, as described, were harmful, leading to the child being taken away. Now, she's trying to reconnect, but the author is hurt and doesn't see her as a mom anymore, just a stranger.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author is being unreasonable by not responding. The author has valid reasons to be estranged. The mom's past actions were serious and legally sanctioned, leading to the child's removal. The author's lack of response could be a way of coping with the trauma and not feeling obligated to repair a relationship that was broken under those circumstances. \n\nAlso, the author is struggling with identity and the mom's inability to provide answers adds to their pain. The mom's messages might feel insincere or like an intrusion into their life. The author might not be in a place to forgive or accept the mom's attempts at reconciliation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding. It's about their emotional well-being and the history they've endured. The mom's actions in the past have created a situation where the author needs time, space, or may not want a relationship. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
