My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they are in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The background is pretty complex. So, when the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, the kid was put in a foster home and adopted. Then, after 18, the mom tried to reconnect through Facebook. The user had a lot of questions about their identity and heritage, but the mom couldn't answer them. Now, the mom sends texts expressing love and regret, but the user doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They were taken from their mom due to her actions, which caused trauma. The adoption was a big part of their life, and they have a strong bond with their adoptive parents. The mom's return after years might feel like an intrusion, especially since she couldn't provide the answers they sought. The user's lack of response could stem from unresolved feelings, fear of betrayal, or anger towards the mom for abandoning them. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is trying to reach out, showing remorse and wanting to be part of their life. From her side, she's clean, found faith, and is expressing love. But the user hasn't had time to process this relationship. \n\nThe key here is emotional readiness. The user isn't ignoring the texts out of spite but because they haven't found the emotional capacity to reconnect. They are not in a position to reciprocate love until they can work through the past. It's about healing and personal boundaries. The user's actions are a response to deep-seated issues, not a simple act of being rude. So, the answer would be that they are not in the wrong because their feelings are valid given the circumstances.\n"
