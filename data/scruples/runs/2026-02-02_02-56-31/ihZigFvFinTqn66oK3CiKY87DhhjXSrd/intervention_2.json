My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The background is pretty intense. Their mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, which led to the child being in a foster home and then adopted. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they were 18. When they reconnected, the mom was apologetic, clean, and trying to be part of their life again.\n\nSo, the user hasn't responded to her love messages. They feel conflicted because they have a lot of unresolved issues and trauma. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not responding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's mom did some really harmful things that led to their separation. The child had to be in a foster home, which is a traumatic experience. The mom's actions caused a lot of pain, and the user is dealing with that. When they reconnect, the mom is trying to make amends, but the user is still hurt and doesn't feel they can love her back. \n\nEmotionally, it's understandable that they can't just forgive and forget. The user has a right to their feelings. They mention that their adoptive parents are supportive and they have a good relationship with them. The user isn't rejecting their mom because she's bad, but because they're still dealing with the aftermath of her actions. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse/neglect, the legal separation, the trauma of being in foster care, and the struggle to reconnect after so many years. The user isn't being cruel; they're dealing with complex emotions. The mom is trying, but the user hasn't been able to move past the hurt. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a straightforward answer. The user isn't in the wrong for not responding. They have a valid reason based on their past. The mom's actions were harmful, and the user is still processing that. It's important to acknowledge their feelings and that they're not obligated to forgive or respond if they're not ready. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, they are not in the wrong). It's about respecting their emotional journey and the trauma they've experienced.\n"
