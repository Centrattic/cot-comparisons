My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. From the context given, the mother had a history of child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the child being placed in foster care and adoption. The mother was legally barred from contacting them until they turned 18. When they did reconnect, the mother admitted to using crack cocaine during pregnancy and being unsure of the user's father's identity. The user feels conflicted, as the mother is now clean and apologetic, but they can't bring themselves to respond to her messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the mother's actions. She was arrested for neglect and drug abuse, which is a serious matter. The child was in foster care and adopted, so the bond might have been severed during that time. The mother's return after 18 years with apologies and attempts to reconnect might be genuine, but the user has valid reasons for not wanting to engage. The user mentions they're not ungrateful but feel like a stranger. \n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong by not responding. The mother sends messages expressing love and missing them, but the user hasn't replied for four years. There's no obligation to respond to family, especially under such circumstances. The user's feelings of being disconnected and the trauma from the mother's past actions justify their current stance. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends and deserves a response. But given the history and the user's emotional state, it's reasonable for them to prioritize their well-being. The key here is that the mother's actions in the past caused significant harm, and the user is not obligated to reciprocate if they're not ready. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the user has legitimate reasons for not engaging, and their emotional response is valid given the history.\n"
