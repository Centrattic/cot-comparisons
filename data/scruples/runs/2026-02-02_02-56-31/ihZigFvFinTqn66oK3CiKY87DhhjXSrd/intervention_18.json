My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages over four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, there's the backstory: the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the user was 6. They were put in a foster home and eventually adopted. Then, the mom couldn't contact them until they were 18. After that, they connected via Facebook, but the mom didn't have answers about the user's father or heritage. The user felt let down and hasn't spoken to her since. Now, the mom messages them with love and support, but the user doesn't respond, feeling like a stranger.\n\nThe user is conflicted. They want to know about their past but also feel resentment. The question is whether their choice to ignore the mom's messages is wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's about emotional healing. The user experienced significant trauma and neglect. The mom's absence for so long, especially due to legal reasons, probably caused lasting emotional damage. The user's decision to cut off contact could be a form of self-protection. They might not feel obligated to maintain a relationship with someone who abandoned them and caused harm.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mom has made amends, is clean, and wants to reconnect. But the user has valid reasons to be distrustful. The fact that she couldn't provide answers about their father or heritage might add to the user's frustration. The user isn't ignoring her just for spite; it's because they're still dealing with the aftermath of abandonment and betrayal.\n\nSo, considering the history of abuse, neglect, and the legal separation, the user's actions are more about protecting their emotional well-being. They're not in the wrong for not engaging with someone who caused them pain, even if the person is now trying to reconcile. The answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
