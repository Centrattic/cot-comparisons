My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's mother was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, and she left the state, not allowed to contact them until they turned 18. The author was in a foster home and then adopted by a new family, which they love. After 18, the mom contacted them via Facebook, and the author learned a lot about their past, including that their mom used crack cocaine during pregnancy. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and wanting to be part of their life, but the author never responds. They feel the mom is a stranger and can't return the love. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and emotional aspects. The mother was legally prohibited from contacting the author until they were 18, which means she couldn't maintain a relationship during that time. The author was placed in a stable environment with adoptive parents, and they've grown to love them. The mother's return via Facebook brings up a lot of unresolved issues and trauma. The author's response (or lack thereof) is driven by their feelings of anger, betrayal, and being a stranger to her.\n\nThe mother has since cleaned up her life and found faith, but the author might feel that it's too late or that the mother's actions caused lasting damage. The author has a right to their feelings, especially given the history. However, some might argue that the mother is trying to reconnect and deserves a chance, even if the author is hurt. On the other hand, the author's decision not to respond could be seen as cutting off familial ties, which is a personal choice but might be judged by others as harsh.\n\nBut considering the context, the author's trauma and the fact that the mother wasn't part of their life for so long, the author isn't obligated to respond. The mother's actions in the past have led to the author's current feelings. The author is dealing with their own emotions, and it's their choice how to handle the relationship. The question is whether ignoring the texts is wrong given the circumstances.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author has a valid reason for their emotional response. They were neglected, their mother abandoned them, and now they're dealing with the aftermath. The mother's attempts to reconnect are appreciated, but the author has the right to not engage if they feel it's not right for them. It's about personal boundaries and healing from past trauma.\n"
