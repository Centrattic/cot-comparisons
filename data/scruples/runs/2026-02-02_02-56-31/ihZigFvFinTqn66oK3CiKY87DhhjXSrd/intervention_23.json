My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. They have a complicated history. Their mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, which led to their placement in foster care until adoption. Now, after turning 18, the mom has reached out again, but the user isn't responding emotionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their perspective. They were neglected as a child, which is traumatic. The mother's absence and the reasons behind it (drugs, multiple fathers, unknown nationality) add layers of pain. The user might feel disconnected because of the years of absence and the lack of a real relationship now. They might see the mother as a stranger, so not responding emotionally is a protective mechanism.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is trying to reconnect, showing remorse, and being clean now. But the user's trauma makes it hard to accept or reciprocate those feelings. Is it wrong to not respond to someone who wasn't there during critical years? The user's actions are a result of past trauma and current emotional barriers, which are valid.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, if someone has caused you harm and you're not ready to forgive or engage, it's not necessarily wrong. The user is prioritizing their emotional well-being. However, if the mother is trying to build a relationship now, the user's silence might be seen as cutting off a potential healing process. But given the history, the user's stance is understandable. They aren't ignoring her out of spite but because of unresolved trauma.\n\nSo, the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the user's actions stem from justified emotional responses to past trauma rather than malice. They have the right to set boundaries until they're ready to engage, if ever.\n"
