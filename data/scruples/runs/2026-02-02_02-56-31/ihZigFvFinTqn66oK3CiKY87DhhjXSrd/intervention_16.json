My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's love messages for four years. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the background: The user's mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. They were in foster care and then adopted by a new family. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When they did reconnect, the user found out their mom had been using drugs during pregnancy and didn't know the father's identity. The mom now says she's clean and wants to be part of their life again, but the user can't bring themselves to respond to her messages.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect, the mother's past actions leading to separation, the emotional impact on the user, and the current lack of response. The user feels a disconnect because they view the mother as a stranger despite her efforts to reconnect. \n\nThe question is whether the user is wrong for not responding. From an emotional standpoint, the user has valid reasons for their feelings. The mother's past actions caused significant trauma and a loss of connection. The user might be struggling with trust and emotional pain, making it difficult to reciprocate love. \n\nHowever, the mother is reaching out, showing remorse, and trying to rebuild the relationship. The user's silence could be seen as cutting off someone who is making an effort. But given the circumstances, it's also understandable that the user hasn't forgiven her yet. There's no right or wrong answer in such emotional situations, but it depends on the user's healing process.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some might argue the user is justified in their feelings, while others might think they should make an effort. But considering the trauma involved, it's more about the user's emotional state rather than being in the wrong. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
