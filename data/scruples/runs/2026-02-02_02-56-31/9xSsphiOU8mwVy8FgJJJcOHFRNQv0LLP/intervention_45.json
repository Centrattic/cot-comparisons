I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them. The main issue here seems to be about the husband's feelings of emasculation if his wife makes more money. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They don't plan on having kids, so financial stability isn't as crucial as it might be in a family. The husband says he makes enough for them to live comfortably, so the wife's decision to pursue a higher salary isn't about necessity but personal ambition.\n\nThe wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which removes the financial burden on the couple. The husband's initial hesitation was based on the wife not wanting to go back to school, but now she's interested again. The husband's real concern is his own ego and feeling good as the breadwinner. That's a common issue, but it's important to evaluate if such feelings are valid in a healthy relationship.\n\nIn a modern context, gender roles have evolved, and it's expected that both partners can have independent careers. The husband's reaction might be influenced by traditional stereotypes rather than the wife's actual needs or desires. The wife is expressing a desire to follow her dream, which is a significant personal goal. The husband's opposition, even if he backs off, could be seen as undermining her aspirations.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's right to pursue her career and the husband's emotional response. The husband's argument that the wife loves her current job is valid, but she's choosing to pursue a different path. It's her choice, and supporting her should be a priority. The husband's feeling of emasculation is a personal issue that might need addressing, perhaps through communication or self-reflection. However, the wife's autonomy in career decisions is important, and the husband shouldn't hinder her for his own ego. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband is in the wrong because he's allowing his own insecurities to affect his support for his wife's ambitions. The correct answer should be A.\n"
