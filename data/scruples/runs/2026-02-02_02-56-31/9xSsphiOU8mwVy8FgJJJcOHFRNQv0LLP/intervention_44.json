I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The key points here are his feelings about being the breadwinner and possible emasculation, even though they can live comfortably on his salary alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support the couple when he was in school. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her education, which could lead to a higher salary. The user's main objection is about his own feelings of being emasculated rather than practical concerns about finances. They don't plan on having kids, so the financial need isn't an issue. \n\nIt's important to think about respect and equality in the relationship. The wife's desire to pursue her dream, even if it's different from what he expected, is a personal choice. The user's reaction seems rooted in insecurity rather than the wife's best interest. In healthy relationships, supporting each other's goals is crucial. If his primary concern is about his self-worth tied to being the higher earner, that might indicate a personal issue rather than a valid reason to discourage her. \n\nAlso, the fact that her parents are offering financial support removes the usual barriers to education. The user's reluctance might come off as controlling or not valuing her aspirations. However, he did express his concerns and backed off, which shows he's not outright opposing her. Still, the underlying motivation is self-centered. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is in the wrong because his resistance is based on his own insecurities rather than the wife's well-being or the couple's needs. He should be supporting her decision if it's what she truly wants.\n"
