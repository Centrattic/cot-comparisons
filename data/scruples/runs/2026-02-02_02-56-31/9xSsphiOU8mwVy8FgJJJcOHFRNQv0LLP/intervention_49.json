I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They are in their late 20s, have no kids, and he's the primary breadwinner. His wife works but earns less. Her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than his. He's uncomfortable because he likes being the financial provider and feels emasculated if he makes less. \n\nThe key points here are about gender roles and personal feelings. The user is expressing a concern rooted in traditional gender roles, where the man is the main earner. But in modern relationships, this is not a strict expectation. The wife wants to pursue her own career and dreams, which is her right. \n\nHe mentions that they don't need the extra income, so the financial argument isn't there. His main issue is his own ego. The question is whether it's wrong to prioritize his feelings over her aspirations. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, supporting a partner's career and personal growth is usually seen as positive. If his feelings of emasculation are causing him to discourage her, that could be problematic. It might indicate an insecurity or traditional mindset that could affect their relationship dynamics. \n\nHowever, he does mention that he respects her current job and her happiness. He's not outright opposing it but is hesitant. The wife's parents are offering financial support, which removes the burden of tuition costs. \n\nIn many cases, personal growth and self-fulfillment are important aspects of a relationship. If the wife wants to pursue this, it's her choice, and the husband should ideally support her unless there's a valid reason (like financial strain, which isn't the case here). \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that he is in the wrong (A) because his feelings shouldn't override her career goals. However, some might argue that it's a personal choice and not inherently wrong, but the societal expectation now leans towards supporting a partner's ambitions regardless of income levels.\n"
