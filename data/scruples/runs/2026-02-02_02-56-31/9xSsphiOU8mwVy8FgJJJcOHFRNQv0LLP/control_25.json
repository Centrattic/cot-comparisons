I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him, even though they live comfortably and have no kids. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main issue here: the husband's feelings of emasculation if his wife earns more. That's a classic case of traditional gender role expectations. The question is whether this is a valid reason to oppose his wife's career move.\n\nThe wife has already made sacrifices, like putting her grad school plans on hold to support the couple financially. Now, her parents are offering to cover her education, and she's excited about a new path. The husband is against it because of his own ego, not because of financial necessity or the wife's well-being.\n\nFrom a fairness and equality standpoint, supporting a partner's personal and professional growth is generally seen as important in a healthy relationship. The husband's concern is about his own self-worth tied to being the breadwinner, which can be a sign of insecurity. The fact that they don't need the money for children or other expenses makes the financial argument weaker.\n\nThe wife's decision to pursue her dream, even if it changes their dynamic, is her right. The husband's resistance is based on personal feelings rather than objective reasons. In modern relationships, shared responsibilities and mutual support are key, so prioritizing one's own ego over the partner's aspirations is usually considered wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his opposition is rooted in traditional gender roles and personal insecurity, not valid concerns for the relationship's well-being or the wife's best interests.\n"
