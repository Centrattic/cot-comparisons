I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a guy in his late 20s married to his wife. They don't have kids, and he makes enough for them to live comfortably. His wife works but makes less than half of his salary. She had put her grad school plans on hold during his master's, and now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her to go to grad school. The program would lead to a higher salary than his. He's not sure if she should do it because he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if she makes more. He's worried about this dynamic changing even though they don't need the money. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, let's consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife has already made a sacrifice by putting her education on hold to support them. Now she's excited about a new opportunity that's been made possible by her parents' financial support. The author's main issue is about his ego and feeling good about being the primary earner. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, supporting each other's career aspirations is usually important. The wife is pursuing her dream here, which she may have put on hold before. The fact that her parents are helping financially removes the financial burden from the couple. The husband's resistance seems to stem from personal feelings of insecurity rather than practical concerns. \n\nThe husband mentions they don't need the money, so there's no economic necessity for him to earn more. His concern is about his self-image and societal expectations about being the breadwinner. This seems outdated and possibly harmful because it's based on traditional gender roles. \n\nAlso, the wife's happiness and fulfillment in her career should be a priority. If she wants to pursue this path, the husband's support is important for the relationship's health. His reluctance to let her go due to ego might hinder her personal growth and could lead to resentment if she feels unsupported.\n\nHowever, there's a point where the husband might feel emasculated, but that's more about his own mindset rather than the wife's actions. It's his responsibility to work through those feelings rather than imposing them on her. The fact that he's the primary earner isn't a problem, but opposing her career growth for ego seems wrong.\n\nI think the key factors here are the wife's right to pursue her dreams, the husband's lack of valid reasons beyond personal insecurity, and the potential impact on their relationship. The husband is in the wrong because he's not supporting his wife's aspirations due to his own ego, which isn't a fair or healthy reason in a partnership.\n"
