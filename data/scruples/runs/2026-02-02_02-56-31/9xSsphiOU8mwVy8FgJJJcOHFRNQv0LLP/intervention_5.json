I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They don't have kids, and he's the sole breadwinner. His main issue is feeling emasculated if she makes more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is worried about his self-esteem and societal expectations about being the main earner. The wife is interested in a graduate program her parents are funding, which would lead to a higher salary. She already put her education on hold before to support the relationship, but now she wants to pursue her dream.\n\nThe husband's reasons are partly about his own feelings. He admits he's not happy about being the breadwinner anymore, which is a personal insecurity. The wife's reasons are more about her own aspirations and possibly her parents' influence. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife is making a choice about her education and career. The husband's opposition is based on his feelings about their dynamic, not on practical needs since they can live comfortably. If he's not in a position where her higher income would create financial strain, then his objection might be more about his self-perception rather than her actual needs or wants.\n\nAlso, the husband's comment about not thinking any guy would feel good about making less than their partner suggests a cultural or societal expectation. However, in modern relationships, dual-income households are common, and it's more about mutual support than who earns more. \n\nThe wife's decision to pursue her education is her own, and while the husband has the right to express his concerns, discouraging her because it affects his ego could be seen as prioritizing his feelings over her aspirations. There's also the aspect of the wife having already sacrificed her education for their relationship, so now wanting to pursue it again could be a valid personal goal.\n\nSo, the husband is in the wrong because his opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than her best interests. He should support her decision, even if it affects their financial dynamic, especially since their needs are already met.\n"
