I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The author is a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him, even though they can live comfortably on his income.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning is based on his personal feelings about being the breadwinner and not wanting to feel emasculated. He acknowledges this might be an unpopular opinion. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support the relationship financially, and now she's considering going back with her parents' funding. Her motivation is to pursue a dream, even though she loves her current job.\n\nThe husband's concern isn't about financial necessity since they don't need more money. His issue is more about ego and societal norms. The question is whether this makes him wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband's feelings are valid, but his reasoning might be problematic. Traditional gender roles are being challenged here. The wife has the right to pursue her education and career, regardless of her husband's feelings. Supporting a partner's growth is often seen as important in a healthy relationship. The fact that he feels emasculated by her potential higher earnings is more about his own insecurities rather than any real harm to their relationship. \n\nAdditionally, the wife's parents are offering the financial support, so there's no financial burden on the couple. The husband's stance might hinder the wife's personal fulfillment. Relationships should ideally encourage each other's ambitions. So, while the husband's feelings are real, prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations could be seen as wrong. \n\nThe answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the decision to not support a partner's educational and career goals based on ego, especially when it's not a financial necessity, is generally considered problematic in modern relationship standards.\n"
