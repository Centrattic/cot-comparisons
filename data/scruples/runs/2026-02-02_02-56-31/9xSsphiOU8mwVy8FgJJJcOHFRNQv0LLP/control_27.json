I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether he's at fault for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the context: They're in their late 20s, he makes enough for them to live comfortably, she's working but earns less. They don't plan to have kids. She put her graduate studies on hold to support them, and now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school. She's interested in a different career that would pay more than him. He's against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she makes more. \n\nSo, the main issue here is his insecurity about being the primary breadwinner. The question is whether his feelings justify him opposing her career move. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, supporting your partner's ambitions is usually seen as important. If she wants to pursue her dreams and has the opportunity (with financial support from her parents), it's generally encouraged. The fact that he's against it because of his own ego might be problematic. \n\nHe also mentions that they don't need the extra money, so it's not about financial necessity. The problem is his personal feelings of inadequacy if she earns more. In a healthy relationship, partners should support each other's growth regardless of income. His opposition seems to stem from insecurity rather than practical concerns. \n\nHowever, he did consider her current job satisfaction and mentioned her love for it. He backed off after realizing her determination. Still, the root reason he's not happy is his own emasculating feelings. That could be seen as unfair because it's his own ego over her aspirations. \n\nSociety is moving towards gender equality in relationships, so having one partner earn more isn't inherently a problem. The fact that he's the one feeling insecure might be a personal issue he needs to address. \n\nIf the wife wants to pursue her education and career for her own fulfillment, her husband's opposition based on his self-esteem could be seen as him being in the wrong. The answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his reasons are self-centered and not aligned with supporting her goals.\n"
