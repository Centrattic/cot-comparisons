I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is a man in his late 20s, married, making enough to support them both comfortably. His wife currently works but earns less than half. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial pressure. She put her grad school plans on hold to work and support them when he was in school, and now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary than him.\n\nThe user is conflicted because he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated at the thought of making less. He's not outright blocking her, but he's hesitant and maybe even a bit upset. The key here is whether his feelings and stance are valid or if he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a general perspective, personal ambition and education are important. Supporting a partner's growth is usually a good thing. The user's concern is based on his own ego and societal expectations about gender roles. In modern relationships, it's more about mutual support rather than traditional roles. The wife is considering this for her dream, not just money, and the parents' offer is a financial boon. The user's hesitation seems to stem from insecurity rather than practical concerns like financial need or her happiness.\n\nHe should consider that his wife's career choice is her decision. While it's okay to express concerns, he shouldn't let his ego override her aspirations. The fact that they don't need the money removes the financial justification for him to resist. So, the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his feelings over her ambitions and the couple's mutual support."
