I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a man in his late 20s, married with a wife who works but earns less than half his salary. They don't plan on having kids, so their financial needs are met by his income. The wife had put her graduate school plans on hold to work full-time and support them. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead her to a higher salary than him. The author is uneasy because he values being the primary breadwinner and fears feeling emasculated if she earns more.\n\nThe key points here are the author's motivations. He's not against her education or career for her sake; it's more about his own ego and the dynamic in their relationship. He admits to feeling emasculated if he makes less, which is a personal insecurity. The wife, on the other hand, is excited to pursue her dream and seems to have a clear interest in the program, even though it's a different path from her current job.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships, it's generally encouraged for individuals to pursue their own goals and growth, regardless of how it affects the partner's earnings. The fact that the author's stance is based on his own ego rather than his wife's best interests or their financial necessity might be problematic. They can live comfortably on his salary, so her earning more isn't a financial burden. The author's discomfort stems from self-esteem issues, not practical concerns.\n\nAlso, the wife had previously paused her education to support the relationship, which shows she's made sacrifices. Now she's following her own aspirations. The author's reluctance could be seen as undermining her autonomy. Even though he tried to be supportive by discussing her interests, his underlying reason is about maintaining a certain status in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife's decision is about her personal growth and career, which should be respected. The author's feelings about his role as the breadwinner are his own issues to work through. It's not the wife's responsibility to accommodate his insecurities. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his opposition is based on personal ego rather than genuine reasons related to their partnership's well-being.\n\nSo, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
