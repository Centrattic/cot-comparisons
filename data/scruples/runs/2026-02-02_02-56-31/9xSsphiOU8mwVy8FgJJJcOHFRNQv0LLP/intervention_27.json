I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: They're in their late 20s, he's the primary earner, they don't plan to have kids, and she's considering going back to grad school with her parents' financial support. He feels emasculated by the idea of her making more than him, even though they can live comfortably on his salary alone.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal feelings versus respect in a relationship. The user's main issue isn't financial\u2014it's about their self-esteem and the dynamic in the relationship. He's worried about being the \"breadwinner,\" which is a traditional role that some people value. But is that a valid reason to discourage his wife from pursuing her goals?\n\nOn one hand, supporting a partner's education and career is generally seen as important in a healthy relationship. The wife's interest in grad school might be about her own aspirations, not just money. The husband's reaction might come off as dismissive of her ambitions, which could be hurtful. Even if the financial aspect isn't an issue, the emotional aspect is. The husband's feelings of emasculation are personal, but they shouldn't override her desires if they're mutual in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband does mention that they don't need the money, so it's not about financial security. But the issue is his personal discomfort with the role reversal. It's a matter of self-image and societal expectations. However, in modern relationships, mutual respect and support are emphasized more than traditional gender roles. If the husband can't support his wife's goals for her own fulfillment, even if it affects his ego, that could be seen as selfish or not fully respecting her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the wife had already put her grad school plans on hold to support him during his studies. Now she's choosing to pursue it, and he's not supporting her decision. That might make her feel like her earlier sacrifice wasn't valued. It's a bit of a contradiction. \n\nSo, the husband's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than any objective reason related to their financial situation or her well-being. In a partnership, supporting each other's personal growth is usually considered important. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong because his opposition is rooted in his personal feelings rather than the wife's best interests or their relationship's health.\n"
