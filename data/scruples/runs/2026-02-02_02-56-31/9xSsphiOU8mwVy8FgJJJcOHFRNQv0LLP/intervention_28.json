I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They mention that he's the primary breadwinner, and he feels emasculated at the thought of making less. His wife is considering going back to grad school with her parents' support, which would lead her to a higher salary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband's feelings about being the breadwinner are important, but so is his wife's autonomy. The user is worried that his opposition is based on his own ego rather than rational reasons. The wife already has a job she loves but is excited about a new path. The husband's main concern is his own ego, not practical needs like childcare, since they don't plan on having kids.\n\nIn modern relationships, supporting each other's career goals is often emphasized. The husband's reluctance seems to stem from insecurity rather than practical concerns. Even though he mentions they live comfortably, his emotional response is about his self-worth tied to being the higher earner. The wife's decision to pursue her goals should ideally be free from her partner's ego issues. \n\nHowever, the situation is complex. He did support her when she put her grad plans on hold to work full-time. Now, he's not against her going back in principle but is unsettled because it would change their dynamic. The question is whether his feelings are valid or if he's imposing his insecurities on her. \n\nSociety often stigmatizes men for feeling emasculated, but it's a real emotion some have. Still, a healthy relationship should prioritize the partner's aspirations over the other's ego. The husband's reasoning is self-centered, so he might be in the wrong. The answer would likely be A, but I need to check if there's any nuance. Since the wife is making her own choice and the husband's objection is based on his feelings, he's not respecting her autonomy. So, Answer A.\n"
