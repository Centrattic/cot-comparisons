I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband is asking if it's his fault for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial pressure. The wife put her grad school on hold to work and now her parents are offering to pay for her education again.\n\nThe husband's main issue is that he feels emasculated if she makes more than him. He's the current breadwinner, and that makes him feel good. The wife, on the other hand, wants to follow her dream even though she loves her current job. \n\nHmm, the key points here are about his insecurity and the wife's desire to pursue her own path. The husband's reason is based on his own ego and feelings about being the breadwinner. But is that a valid reason to discourage his wife? She has her own aspirations, and it's her choice to pursue them regardless of financial implications. Also, their financial situation is stable, so it's not about needing money. \n\nIn terms of equality in the relationship, the husband's concern about his self-worth tied to his salary seems problematic. It's his own issue to deal with, not something that should stop his wife from advancing her career. The fact that she's already made a choice to work full-time before because they were a couple might be relevant. Now she's getting another chance, and he's resisting not because it's bad for the relationship, but because of his own insecurities. \n\nI think the answer here is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's letting his personal insecurities affect his wife's decisions. She has the right to pursue her goals, especially since their financial situation doesn't require him to be the sole breadwinner. His feelings about his role shouldn't override her aspirations. Plus, true support in a relationship means encouraging each other's growth, even if it changes the dynamic.\n"
