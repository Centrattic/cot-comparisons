  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?\nI know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife already has a job she loves and they live comfortably on his income. She's been putting her graduate plans aside, but now her parents are offering to cover her education costs. The user admits that part of his hesitation is feeling emasculated if his wife earns more.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, some might think it's a personal issue, but modern views often emphasize equality and supporting each other's ambitions. The user's concern about being the breadwinner is valid, but it's also about his own insecurities. The wife is making a choice that could lead to her personal growth and career satisfaction. If the user is opposing it just because of his ego, that's a problem. However, if he's genuinely concerned about their financial stability or the feasibility of her new career path, that's different. But the user clarifies they don't need more money and she's changing fields, which adds complexity.\n\nThe key points here are the user's admission of feeling emasculated and the wife's desire to pursue her dream. Supporting a partner's aspirations is a cornerstone of a healthy relationship. The user's reluctance is based on personal feelings rather than practical considerations. Therefore, even if his feelings are real, it's important to consider the wife's happiness and growth. The answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong) because his stance is rooted in insecurity rather than objective reasons, and it's about supporting her choice.\n"
