I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them. They provided a detailed scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband is in their late 20s, making enough for both to live comfortably. The wife currently works but earns less than half of his salary. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no immediate financial need. Her parents are offering to pay for grad school, which she was previously putting off. She now wants to go back for her dream, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if he makes less than her, even though their finances are fine.\n\nSo, the main ethical question here is whether the husband's feelings about being the sole breadwinner and potential embarrassment are valid, or if he's wrong to prioritize his ego over his wife's aspirations. \n\nI should consider different perspectives. From the husband's side, he might feel a loss of identity or self-worth if his income is less than his wife's. That's a real emotion, but it's important to note that this is about his personal feelings. However, the wife is clear about her interest in pursuing her dream and has a path that's being financially supported by her parents. The couple's financial situation is already comfortable, so there's no practical reason against her pursuing it. \n\nThe husband's initial reaction was to question the decision, which is okay if it's based on concern. But the underlying reason is his own ego. That's where it gets tricky. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is crucial. The wife's career choice is her own, and if she's excited about it, the husband's resistance based on his feelings of emasculation might be problematic. It's about personal choice versus traditional gender roles. \n\nAlso, the wife had previously paused her grad school plans to support the couple, which the husband acknowledges. Now she's choosing her own path again, which could be seen as a natural progression. The husband might need to address his feelings of self-worth being tied to being the breadwinner. Maybe there's an unspoken expectation or societal pressure influencing him.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not supporting his wife's ambitions solely because of his own insecurities, that's a red flag. The wife's happiness and personal growth are important, and the husband's financial status shouldn't be the deciding factor here if it's not necessary for their lifestyle. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be AITA for the husband. He's letting his ego affect his partner's career choices when there's no real financial need. The wife's desire to pursue her dream should be supported unless there are other valid concerns, which in this case there aren't. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
