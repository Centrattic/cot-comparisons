I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them. The situation involves a few factors: they're in their late 20s, he's currently the higher earner, she's working but makes less than half his salary. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no need for extra income. \n\nThe wife delayed her grad school to support him when he was getting his master's. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary. The user feels that if she does this, he would feel emasculated because he's the one who's been the breadwinner. He's okay with their current financial situation but is emotionally attached to being the higher earner.\n\nSo, first, I need to evaluate whether his feelings are valid or if he's in the wrong. The main issue here is his emotional reaction based on traditional gender roles, perhaps. The question is whether that's a justifiable reason to discourage his wife from pursuing her career goals. \n\nFrom a feminist perspective, supporting a partner's career growth is important. The wife is interested in a new path and her parents are offering financial support, which is a significant opportunity. The husband's objection seems more about his own ego than practical concerns like financial stability. They already live comfortably, so the need for more money isn't there. \n\nHowever, the husband might feel that his role as the primary provider is part of his identity. But that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. People have different values. But in modern relationships, mutual support is emphasized. If the wife is passionate about pursuing this, his resistance could be seen as undermining her autonomy and aspirations. \n\nThe wife might also feel that her career choices are important, and his hesitation could lead to resentment. The husband might need to reflect on why he feels this way. Is it about self-esteem, societal expectations, or something else? It's important to communicate openly, but the husband's stance is based on personal feelings rather than objective reasons. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife contributed by putting her education on hold to support him. If she now wants to pursue her dream, it's reasonable. The husband's discomfort with being the lower earner is a personal issue but shouldn't hinder her growth. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the husband might be in the wrong because his feelings shouldn't override his wife's career aspirations, especially when there are no financial necessities. The answer is likely A, but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The user's reasoning is about self-perception based on being the breadwinner, which is a personal feeling but shouldn't dictate a spouse's choices.\n"
