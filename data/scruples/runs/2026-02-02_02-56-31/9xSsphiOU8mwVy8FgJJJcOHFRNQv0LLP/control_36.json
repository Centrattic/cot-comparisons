I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user (the husband) doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. He's worried about feeling emasculated even though they live comfortably without kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife is considering going back to grad school with her parents' support, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband's main issue is about being the breadwinner and feeling good about that. He admits it's about his ego, not financial necessity. \n\nThe wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support them financially when he was in school. Now she's interested again, and he's against it. The problem here is his motivation. If his reason is purely about maintaining his self-esteem and not being \"emasculated,\" that's a personal issue. However, he's the one who had her delay her education before by working full-time. Did he have a right to expect her to stay in that role indefinitely? \n\nAlso, the wife is following her dream, which she loves. The husband is dismissing her interest because of his own feelings. He mentioned that they don't need more money, so the financial argument isn't there. The core issue is his insecurity. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important. By not supporting her because of ego, it seems like he's not being supportive. \n\nThe wife's parents offered to cover the costs, so financial burden isn't a factor here. The husband's main argument is emotional, but that's his own insecurity. The fact that he's projecting his feelings onto the situation, making it about how he feels instead of her aspirations, seems unfair. \n\nSo, the author is prioritizing his own emotional needs over his wife's career aspirations without valid financial reasons. That's a problem. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
