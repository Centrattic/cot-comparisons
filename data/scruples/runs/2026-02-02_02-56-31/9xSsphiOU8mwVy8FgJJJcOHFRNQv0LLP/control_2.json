I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation involves financial dynamics, personal values, and emotional feelings.\n\nFirst, the author makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. His wife currently makes less than half of his salary. She had put her graduate school plans on hold to work full-time and support them. Now, with her parents' financial support, she wants to go back to school for a higher-paying job. The author feels uncomfortable because he's used to being the breadwinner and fears feeling emasculated if her income surpasses his.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons. He admits that his main concern is feeling emasculated if she earns more. That seems self-centered and based on traditional gender roles. The wife's desire to pursue her dream and further her education is valid. Her parents are offering to cover the costs, which reduces the financial burden on them. The author's opposition is not about practical reasons like financial strain or incompatibility with their current lifestyle but personal ego. \n\nIn modern relationships, mutual support for each other's career goals is often seen as important. The fact that the wife is considering her dream despite financial security suggests it's important to her. The author's focus on his own feelings of being the breadwinner might be undermining her autonomy and aspirations. Even though they don't plan to have kids, the wife's career choice should be hers, not dictated by the husband's insecurities. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if there were other valid reasons like financial hardship or conflicting plans, but here, the core issue is his own ego. So, the answer would likely be A, as he's in the wrong for prioritizing his feelings over his wife's aspirations.\n"
