I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. He's in his late 20s, they don't plan on having kids, and he's the primary earner. His wife was going to go to grad school but postponed it to work, and now her parents are offering to pay for it again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user admits that his main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife makes more. That's a key point. Society often conditions men to see being the primary earner as a measure of their worth, but that's not healthy. The wife's decision to pursue her own goals, especially with financial support from her parents, is about her ambitions, not just money. \n\nHe also mentioned they live comfortably on his salary, so there's no financial pressure. The wife's desire to go back to school suggests she has personal aspirations. The user's reaction might stem from insecurity rather than practical concerns. Even though he claims to back off after the conversation, his underlying feelings might still affect their relationship. \n\nThe wife's parents' motivations could be their own, but that's separate from the user's feelings. The core issue is the user's comfort with his role as the breadwinner. It's important for partners to support each other's growth, even if it changes the financial dynamics. The user might not be \"wrong\" in his feelings, but he's not handling it well. His priority should be his wife's happiness and her right to pursue her dreams, not his ego. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to communicate openly and support each other's individual goals. The user's hesitation is more about his personal insecurities than the practicality of the situation. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not fully supporting his wife's aspirations based on his own feelings about being the primary earner.\n"
