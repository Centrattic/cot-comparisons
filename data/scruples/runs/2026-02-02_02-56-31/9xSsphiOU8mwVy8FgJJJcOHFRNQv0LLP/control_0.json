I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband makes enough for both to live comfortably. The wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to work and support them. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad education, which would lead her to a higher salary. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if she earns more, even though they don't need the extra money.\n\nThe wife's parents might have their own reasons, maybe wanting to help her, but the husband's main concern is his ego. The wife loves her current job but wants to pursue a different dream. The husband is against it mainly because of his own feelings about being the breadwinner. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's ambitions is usually important. The husband's reasoning seems self-centered. Even though they don't need the money, the wife's desire for personal growth and her dream shouldn't be dismissed because of his insecurities. Plus, they already have a history where she put her education on hold for their financial stability, and now he's resisting her moving forward. That could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his objections are based on his own ego rather than the wife's aspirations or their actual financial needs. Supporting a partner's career growth is a key part of a healthy relationship, and his feelings of emasculation shouldn't override her goals.\n"
