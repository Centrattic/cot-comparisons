  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?\nI know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that could earn more than they do. First, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe wife currently works but makes less than the husband. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial pressure. The wife put her grad school plans on hold when they started dating to support him through his degree. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary. The husband is uncomfortable with the idea of her earning more than him, feeling it might make him feel emasculated despite their financial stability.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the husband's self-esteem issues tied to being the breadwinner and the wife's desire to pursue her dream. The husband's reasons aren't about financial necessity but rather personal feelings. The wife is considering a different career path she loves but it's a big change. The husband's opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than practical concerns like financial needs or the wife's well-being.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that each partner supports the other's goals and aspirations. If the husband's objection is rooted in ego rather than the wife's best interests, that could be a problem. However, he does express that they live comfortably, so financial stability isn't an issue. The wife's parents' motives (embarrassment) might add another layer, but it's her decision to make.\n\nThe husband should consider if his opposition is fair. If the wife is happy and the financial situation remains secure, her earning more shouldn't be a problem. The fact that he's okay with her working but not with her earning more than him suggests a double standard. It might also affect the wife's autonomy and her right to pursue her dreams without his approval based on his ego.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, his reasons are self-centered. He needs to reflect on whether his feelings are valid or if he's projecting insecurities onto the relationship. Healthy relationships should support each other's growth. If he can't overcome this, it might lead to future issues. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because his objections are based on his own feelings rather than the wife's happiness or the relationship's health.\n"
