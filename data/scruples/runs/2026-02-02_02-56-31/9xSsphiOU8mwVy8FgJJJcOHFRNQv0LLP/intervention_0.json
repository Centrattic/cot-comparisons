  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?\nI know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the user is a guy in his late 20s, married, making a good salary. His wife works but makes less than half of what he does. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no immediate need for more money. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time and support them when he was in school. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a career path where she'd make more than him. He's uncomfortable with the idea because he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the man's reasons are based on his feelings about being the breadwinner and his ego. He acknowledges that this is an unpopular opinion. The wife is considering this change because she's excited about her dream, even though she loves her current job. She had stopped talking about grad school before, but now she's interested again. The parents' offer is financial, which removes the cost barrier.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the key points are the man's motivations. He's basing his opposition on his own insecurities rather than his wife's best interests. The wife previously made a sacrifice for him, now she's considering her own growth. His feelings of emasculation are personal, but in a healthy relationship, both partners' goals should be respected. He should support her decisions unless there are valid practical reasons against it, like financial strain. But in this case, the education is free from her parents, so there's no financial burden. The main conflict is his ego versus her aspirations. \n\nHe's not considering her happiness or her career goals. The fact that they don't need more money doesn't negate her personal fulfillment. He should be supportive unless there are other issues. His response was to express doubt and not support her choice, which might hinder her. In modern relationships, equality in decision-making is important. Even if he feels uncomfortable, his wife's autonomy and happiness are crucial. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for prioritizing his ego over her aspirations.\n"
