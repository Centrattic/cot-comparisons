I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's right to not want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author and his wife are in their late 20s. He's the main breadwinner, and they don't plan to have kids. His wife currently works a job she loves, but her parents are offering to pay for grad school in a different field that would lead to a higher salary than his. She wants to pursue her dream, even though she's happy in her current job.\n\nThe author's main issue is that he feels emasculated if she makes more than him. He's uncomfortable with the idea of not being the sole financial provider anymore. But the key points here are his reasons. The wife has the opportunity to go back to school for free due to her parents' offer, and she's chosen to do so because it's her dream. The author's objection isn't about her capability or the feasibility, but his own feelings of self-worth tied to her salary.\n\nIn terms of ethics and relationships, a healthy partnership should support each other's goals and growth, regardless of financial implications. The author's concern is about his own ego rather than his wife's happiness or the couple's needs. Since they don't need more money, his hesitation seems to be a personal insecurity. The wife is making a choice that's beneficial for her career and personal satisfaction, and the author is not being supportive because of his own pride.\n\nAlso, the wife had previously put her grad school plans on hold to support the couple, which might mean that her decision to pursue it now is a significant step towards her own aspirations. The author's reaction might undermine her autonomy and the opportunity she's being given. Feeling emasculated because of a partner's success is a common issue but it's considered problematic in modern relationship standards where equality and mutual support are valued. \n\nSo the author is prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's dreams and the opportunity provided by her parents. That's usually seen as the wrong approach in a relationship. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
