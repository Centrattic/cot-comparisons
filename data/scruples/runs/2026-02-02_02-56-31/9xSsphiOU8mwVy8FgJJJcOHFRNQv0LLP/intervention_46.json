I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband (or partner) doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him. The key points are:\n\n1. They are in their late 20s, no kids, and he's the main breadwinner. She's working but makes less than half of his salary. They live comfortably on his income.\n\n2. The wife put her grad school plans on hold to support them when he was in school. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than his. She wants to do it, but he's against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she earns more.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the husband's feelings about being the primary earner and not wanting his wife to surpass him financially. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife initially paused her education to support them, and now she's excited about a new opportunity. The husband's resistance seems to stem from ego rather than practical concerns (since they don't need the money). That's a red flag. It's not about their well-being but his self-esteem.\n\nIn modern relationships, mutual support for each other's goals is usually valued. The husband's hesitation is based on his own feelings of inadequacy rather than the wife's best interests. Even though they can afford her education, his opposition is about his self-worth, which isn't a valid reason to discourage her from pursuing something she wants.\n\nAlso, the wife's parents are funding the education, so there's no financial burden on them as a couple. The husband's main argument is that he doesn't like the idea of her making more. This seems selfish and traditional, possibly patriarchal. It's about maintaining a certain role in the relationship rather than supporting her growth.\n\nHowever, some might argue that if the wife is content in her current job and the husband is happy being the sole provider, maybe there's no issue. But the wife is expressing a desire to change, which the husband is resisting not because it's impractical but because of his own ego. That's a problem.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife contributed by supporting him when he was in school. Now she's wanting to invest in herself, which is her right. The husband's opposition is undermining her autonomy and her goals. Healthy relationships should encourage each other's aspirations unless there are real, concrete reasons against it. Here, the reason is purely about his feelings, which isn't a good basis for denying her opportunities.\n\nSo, even if the husband's feelings are genuine, they shouldn't dictate the wife's choices. The answer is likely that he's in the wrong because his actions are based on ego and not in the best interest of his partner's aspirations.\n"
