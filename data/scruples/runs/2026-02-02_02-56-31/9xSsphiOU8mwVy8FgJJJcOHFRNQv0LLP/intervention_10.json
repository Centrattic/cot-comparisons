  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?\nI know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the main point seems to be about the man's feelings regarding being the primary breadwinner. He mentions feeling emasculated if he makes less, which is a personal feeling. But the wife has an opportunity here, supported by her parents, to get a better education and potentially a higher salary. \n\nHe also says they live comfortably on his salary alone and don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity. The wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to support the relationship, and now she's considering it again. The man is against it mainly because of his ego, not practical reasons.\n\nIn terms of fairness, supporting a partner's career growth is generally seen as important in a healthy relationship. The husband's hesitation is based on his own insecurities rather than the wife's best interests. Even though he's comfortable financially, the wife has a chance to pursue her own goals. The fact that her parents are offering to cover the costs reduces the financial burden on the couple, so it's more about her personal and professional development.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband is prioritizing his feelings over his wife's aspirations. Since the wife is excited and has a valid interest in the program, his opposition based on ego seems to be a problem. Healthy relationships should support each other's growth, even if it changes the power dynamics. So, the answer would likely be A, meaning he's in the wrong.\n"
