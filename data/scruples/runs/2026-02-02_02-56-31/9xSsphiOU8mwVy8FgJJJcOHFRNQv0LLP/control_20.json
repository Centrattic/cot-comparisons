I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Hmm. So first, I need to look at the details.\n\nThe wife already made a sacrifice by putting her grad school plans on hold to support them financially while he was in school. Now her parents are offering to cover her tuition for a grad program that would lead to a higher salary. The husband is worried about his role as the primary breadwinner and feeling emasculated if she makes more. \n\nI think the key points here are about autonomy and self-worth. The wife's decision to go back to school is her personal choice, especially since the parents are covering the costs. The husband's main objection is based on his own feelings about being the higher earner, which seems more about his ego than practical needs. They don't need the money, so it's not a financial necessity. \n\nAlso, the husband admits he's not happy and maybe even a bit resentful. That could affect their relationship dynamics. Supporting each other's career goals is usually important in a partnership. If he's discouraging her because of his own insecurities, that's a problem. \n\nBut wait, maybe there are valid concerns about her switching fields? The asker mentions the career path is \"drastically different,\" but the wife says she wants to pursue her dream. If she's happy and the husband is okay with her current job, but not the new path, maybe there's more to consider. However, the main issue seems to be his discomfort with being the lower earner, not practical reasons like debt or lifestyle changes. \n\nIn relationships, respect and support are crucial. The husband's reasoning is based on his self-esteem rather than the wife's best interests. That makes me lean towards the author being in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
