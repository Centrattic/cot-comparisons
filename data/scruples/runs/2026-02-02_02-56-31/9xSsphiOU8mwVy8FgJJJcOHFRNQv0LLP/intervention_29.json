I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. From his perspective, he's the primary breadwinner, and he finds comfort and self-worth in that role. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial necessity for her to work. He's also mentioned that her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which he thinks is driven by their embarrassment. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife initially put her grad school plans on hold to support the couple financially while he got his master's. Now, she's reconsidering and the user is resisting. His main concern is about his self-esteem and feeling emasculated if he earns less. But is that a valid reason to discourage her from pursuing her own goals?\n\nIn terms of autonomy, a person has the right to pursue their own educational and career aspirations regardless of their partner's income. The user's objection seems to stem from his own insecurities rather than practical reasons. The fact that they don't need the money adds another layer\u2014financial necessity isn't a factor here, so her choice should be based on personal fulfillment.\n\nThe user's feelings are important, but they shouldn't dictate his wife's career decisions. Healthy relationships involve mutual support. If he's not supportive here, it might indicate a deeper issue about his self-worth and how he views his role in the relationship. Also, the wife might feel that her aspirations are being dismissed, which could affect her happiness and sense of agency.\n\nThe user might not be in the wrong in terms of his feelings being valid, but he's wrong in suppressing her opportunities. It's about respecting each other's individual paths. The answer would likely lean towards the user being in the wrong (A) because he's allowing his own insecurities to interfere with his wife's personal growth and career choices.\n"
