I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is in their late 20s, and the husband makes enough for them to live comfortably. The wife currently works but earns less than half of his salary. Her parents offered to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary. The husband is against this mainly because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she earned more. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial pressure. The wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to support him during his studies.\n\nNow, the key points here are the husband's reasons for opposing her career change. He's concerned about his self-esteem and traditional gender roles. But the wife is the one who's interested in pursuing her dream. The husband's main argument is about feeling like the breadwinner, which seems more about his own ego than practical financial needs.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife should have the right to pursue her goals and education, especially since her parents are covering the costs. The husband's objection based on his feelings about being the breadwinner isn't a valid reason to prevent her from advancing her career. It's about his personal insecurities rather than the couple's financial needs. \n\nThe wife chose to support the husband during his studies, but now she's expressing her desire to follow her own path. The husband's reaction seems to prioritize his own feelings over her aspirations. Even though they can afford it, her decision to go to grad school is a personal choice. The husband's feelings of emasculation are his issue to work through, not a reason to deny her opportunities. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than objective reasons related to the couple's well-being. The wife's autonomy and career goals are important, and the husband shouldn't hinder her for selfish reasons.\n"
