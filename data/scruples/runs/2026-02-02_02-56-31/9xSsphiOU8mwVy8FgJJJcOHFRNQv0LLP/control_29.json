I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him, even though they can live comfortably on his salary alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time, which allowed them to live comfortably. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary than the husband. The husband is against it because he feels it would emasculate him to make less than her. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is based on his own feelings of being the primary breadwinner and potential emasculation. The wife, on the other hand, wants to pursue her dream, even though she loves her current job. The husband isn't against her pursuing grad school if it's for a different career path, but this particular path would surpass his income.\n\nLooking at this from an ethical standpoint, the husband's concern is about his self-esteem tied to his financial role in the relationship. However, the wife's autonomy and her desire to pursue her own dreams are also important. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's ambitions is crucial. The husband's resistance seems more about his own ego rather than the wife's best interests or the couple's financial stability.\n\nSociety is moving towards valuing equality in relationships, where both partners can pursue their careers regardless of income levels. The husband's feeling of emasculation is a personal issue that shouldn't dictate the wife's career choices. Even though the husband provides comfortably for both, the wife's right to self-actualization is a significant factor here.\n\nThe fact that her parents are offering financial support for her education removes the financial burden, making her pursuit feasible. The husband's objection is not based on practical reasons like financial necessity but on personal feelings. This could be seen as undermining his wife's autonomy and dreams for her own fulfillment.\n\nTherefore, the husband is prioritizing his own emotional needs over his wife's aspirations, which is a sign of being in the wrong. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
