I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that might make her earn more than him. They mention that they're in their late 20s, he makes enough for them both, and they don't plan to have kids. The wife had put grad school on hold to support him during his master's, and now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school again. He's uncomfortable with her making more because he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's issue seems to stem from personal feelings of masculinity tied to being the primary earner. That's a common societal issue, but it's important to recognize that financial roles in a relationship should be based on mutual respect and support, not ego. The wife is making a decision about her own career and education, which is her right. The fact that her parents are covering the costs removes the financial burden on the couple, which is a key point. The user's main argument is about comfort with the current setup, but that might not justify opposing her aspirations.\n\nAlso, the wife had paused her education to support him earlier, which shows she made sacrifices for their relationship. Now she's pursuing her own path, which could be seen as a positive step for her personal growth. The user's hesitation might be valid if there were financial strain or other issues, but since they can afford her education and she's excited, his resistance feels more about his own insecurities rather than practical concerns.\n\nSociety is increasingly moving towards equality where both partners can have independent careers without one feeling threatened. The user's feelings are valid, but they shouldn't dictate the wife's choices. It's about respecting her autonomy and shared decision-making. If the user can't support her in this, it might indicate a deeper issue in their relationship regarding equality and mutual support.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because opposing her decision based on personal ego without valid financial or practical reasons undermines her autonomy and their partnership's values.\n"
