I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: he's the main breadwinner, they live comfortably, he's feeling emasculated by the idea of her earning more. His wife gave up grad school earlier for their financial needs, but now her parents are offering to pay for it. He doesn't want her to go because he likes being the breadwinner and feels his self-worth tied to that.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I should consider aspects like respect for each other's autonomy, whether his feelings are valid but problematic, and societal norms.\n\nThe husband is expressing a preference that's based on his ego. He's not against her career advancement per se, but against her surpassing him financially. That's a personal feeling, but it's important to check if it's a healthy dynamic. In modern relationships, mutual support is key. If he's preventing her from pursuing a dream (grad school) just because he feels emasculated, that's a problem. Even though he says they don't need the money, she wants to pursue her passion, which is her right.\n\nAlso, her parents are offering financial support, which removes the burden of her paying for it. His main issue is his own self-esteem tied to being the higher earner. That's a personal insecurity, and it's not right to hinder her opportunities because of that. Relationships should encourage each other's growth, not limit it due to ego.\n\nSo, even if his feelings are real, acting on them to prevent her from advancing is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
