  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?\nI know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The context is that he's the primary earner, and he feels emasculated if she makes more. She's being offered grad school by her wealthy parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. He acknowledges his feelings about being the breadwinner and feeling good about supporting them. His wife put her studies on hold to support him, and now she wants to go back for a different career path. He's worried about making less than her, even though they don't need the money since his salary is enough.\n\nSo, the main issue here is his emotional response to her potential higher earnings. Is it his place to influence her decision based on his self-esteem? In healthy relationships, supporting each other's goals is important. If his concern is about ego rather than practical reasons (like financial necessity or her well-being), then he's in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the financial situation is stable, so there's no real need for her to work more. But she wants to pursue her dream, which is her personal goal. He should respect her aspirations unless there are legitimate concerns. His reason is about feeling emasculated, which is a personal insecurity. That's not a valid reason to discourage her from her goals.\n\nAnother angle: he thought she wasn't interested anymore, but she is. He needs to let her make her own decisions. The fact that her parents are offering to pay for school removes financial barriers, so her decision is more about personal fulfillment. He should support her if she's happy and it's her choice.\n\nIn many relationships, partners may have different career paths. It's not about who makes more, but mutual support. His feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override her desires unless there's a mutual agreement. Since she's making a choice for herself, he's in the wrong if he's resisting just because of ego.\n"
