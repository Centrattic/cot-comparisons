I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. His wife currently makes less than half of his salary and works full-time. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no immediate need for her to increase her earnings. She had put her grad school plans on hold when he was in school, and now her parents are offering to pay for it. She wants to go back to pursue a different career path that's higher-paying than his current salary.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's reasoning. He's concerned because he likes being the primary earner and feels it makes him feel emasculated if his wife makes more. He acknowledges this is an unpopular opinion but thinks no man can truly feel good about being out-earned by his partner. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a modern perspective, supporting a partner's career growth is generally seen as positive, regardless of salary. Traditional views about being the breadwinner might be outdated in many contexts. However, the situation isn't entirely straightforward. The wife's decision might involve significant life changes: going back to school, changing careers, which could affect their lifestyle and relationship dynamics. \n\nBut the key point is the author's self-centered motivation. His opposition stems from personal feelings of insecurity and societal expectations rather than practical reasons. The wife is pursuing her dream, which she loves, and her parents are covering the costs, so there's no financial burden on them. The author's argument that they don't need more money is valid, but that shouldn't prevent her from personal fulfillment. \n\nSocietal norms are shifting towards valuing individual aspirations over traditional roles. The author's insecurity about being the breadwinner is his personal issue, but he's projecting that onto his wife's choices. Healthy relationships should support each other's growth, even if it challenges traditional gender roles. \n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning that he would feel emasculated if he made less than her is problematic. It suggests that his self-worth is tied to his income relative to his partner's, which isn't a healthy foundation. The wife's decision to pursue her goals shouldn't be contingent on his feelings. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, his opposition is based on his own insecurities and outdated notions of gender roles. The wife has the right to pursue her career, especially given the support from her parents and her own aspirations. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
