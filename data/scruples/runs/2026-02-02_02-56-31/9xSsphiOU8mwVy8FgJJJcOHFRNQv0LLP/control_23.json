I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. The wife currently works but earns less. She's been offered the chance to go to grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than the husband. The husband is uncomfortable with the idea because he feels emasculated if he isn't the primary breadwinner.\n\nThe question is whether his stance is wrong. Let's consider different angles. \n\nFrom a traditional standpoint, some might think that a spouse's career choices should be independent. However, the husband's reasoning is based on personal feelings about his self-worth being tied to his earnings compared to his wife's. That's a personal issue, but it's also about his emotional response rather than practical needs like financial security.\n\nThe wife put her studies on hold earlier to support the relationship financially. Now, she's excited about going back. The husband is against it partly because he likes being the breadwinner, which could be seen as prioritizing his own ego over her career aspirations. \n\nIn modern relationships, mutual support and individual growth are often emphasized. If the wife wants to pursue her dreams and has the opportunity (with her parents paying), it could be seen as the husband being short-sighted. However, the husband isn't stopping her; he's just not supportive. The wife might still decide to go through with it despite his feelings. \n\nBut the husband's justification is based on his emotional state. There's no mention of financial hardship if she went to school. Since they don't plan to have kids, there's no added financial pressure. His concern is about his self-image rather than practical reasons. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the husband's stance is about his feelings, not her rights. However, if he's undermining her career goals for his ego, that's a problem. The wife's happiness and growth are important. The husband's reasoning is flawed because it's based on traditional gender roles and insecurities. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his resistance is based on his own insecurities rather than practical considerations. He should support her decisions unless there's a valid, shared reason against it.\n"
