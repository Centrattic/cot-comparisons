I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe user is a guy in his late 20s who makes a good salary and supports his wife financially. His wife currently works but makes less than half of what he does. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial pressure to increase their earning potential. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold when he was getting his master's, choosing to work full-time to support them. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary than his current one. The wife is excited about this, but the husband is hesitant because he feels emasculated at the thought of her making more than him. He's worried about being the breadwinner and his self-esteem. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting her to pursue this career path.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's main issue seems to be about ego and societal expectations rather than practical concerns. The couple can live comfortably on his salary alone, so there's no financial need for her to earn more. However, the wife's parents are offering to pay for her education, which removes the financial burden on her. She's pursuing her own dream, which is important for personal fulfillment. The husband's objection is based on his own feelings of emasculation, which is a personal issue but might not be justified in the context of a modern, equal partnership.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's argument is about his feelings, but he's essentially opposing his wife's career advancement for his own ego. The wife is making a choice that aligns with her aspirations, and the husband's financial status shouldn't be a barrier if they don't need more money. The fact that they don't plan to have kids removes another potential reason for financial planning. Additionally, the husband acknowledged that she had put her grad school on hold for their relationship, which was a sacrifice. Now, he's questioning her decision when she has the opportunity. This could be seen as selfish, as he's prioritizing his own self-esteem over her personal growth.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that the dynamic of being the sole provider is important to him. However, personal fulfillment and career growth are important for both partners. If the husband's feelings are causing conflict, it's something they need to communicate about. But is it right for him to block her from pursuing her dream because of his ego? That seems problematic. The wife's parents are covering the costs, so there's no financial strain. The husband's job is secure and sufficient, so there's no risk involved for the wife in making this choice. Therefore, the husband's resistance is based on personal insecurities rather than practical reasons.\n\nI think the key points here are the husband's self-esteem issues versus his wife's right to pursue her career. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's aspirations. The husband's objection is not based on any real financial need but on his own feelings, which is a red flag. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he's in the wrong (A), as he's not supporting his partner's goals for his own ego.\n"
