I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career. The key points here are the husband's reasons and the context provided.\n\nFirst, the husband makes a lot more than his wife, and she's considering going back to grad school with her parents' financial support. He's against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she earns more. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity. The wife had previously put her education on hold to support the relationship, and now she's excited about this new opportunity.\n\nThe husband's main issue is his self-esteem being tied to being the sole breadwinner. That's a personal issue, but it's affecting his support for his wife's ambitions. In a healthy relationship, both partners should encourage each other's growth. The fact that he's letting his ego influence her career decisions could be problematic. Even if he feels uncomfortable, his wife's happiness and goals should matter more than his need to feel superior in terms of income.\n\nAlso, the wife is making a choice that aligns with her interests, supported by her parents. The husband shouldn't be the one to discourage her based on his insecurities. It's possible he's projecting his own feelings of inadequacy onto the situation. The fact that they live comfortably means financial pressure isn't a factor here; it's purely about his personal comfort.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his opposition is rooted in ego rather than practical reasons, and he's not supporting his wife's aspirations despite their financial stability.\n"
