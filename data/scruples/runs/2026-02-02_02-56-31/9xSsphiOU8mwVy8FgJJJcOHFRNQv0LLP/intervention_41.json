  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?\nI know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They're in their late 20s, he's the primary breadwinner, and they don't plan to have kids. The wife had put grad school on hold to support them financially, but now her parents are offering to pay for it, and she wants to go back. The user feels uncomfortable about her making more than him and mentions feeling emasculated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's main issue seems to be about ego and traditional gender roles, feeling that being the higher earner is important for his self-esteem. But the wife is interested in her own dreams and career growth. The question is whether his opposition is valid or if he's wrong to prioritize his feelings over her aspirations.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, society is moving towards valuing individual growth and mutual support in relationships. The user's concern about financial comfort is valid, but the problem lies in his motivation. If he genuinely supported her happiness and growth, that's one thing, but his stated reason is about ego. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships should support each other's ambitions, regardless of income levels. Also, since they don't need the extra income, her career choice isn't a financial burden. So, he's in the wrong for prioritizing his self-esteem over her personal goals. The answer is likely A.\n"
