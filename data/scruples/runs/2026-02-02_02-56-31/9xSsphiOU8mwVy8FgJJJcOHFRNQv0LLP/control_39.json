I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The husband makes enough for them to live comfortably, and his wife currently earns less. Her parents are offering to pay for grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. He's against it because he feels emasculated at the thought of her making more. \n\nThe main issue here is his reason for opposing her career move. It's not about practical concerns like financial need or her not wanting to go, but his own ego. He's projecting his insecurities onto the decision. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, supporting each other's ambitions is key. His reluctance stems from a desire to maintain his role as the sole breadwinner, which isn't a valid reason to hinder her opportunities. Even though they don't need the money, her career choice is about her personal fulfillment and growth. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's excited and committed to her dream, despite his hesitation, suggests that she should have the autonomy to pursue it. The husband's feelings of emasculation are his own problem to address, not a justification to prevent her from advancing. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his reasons are self-centered and don't consider her aspirations. Healthy relationships should encourage mutual support and growth, not be based on traditional gender roles or ego.\n"
