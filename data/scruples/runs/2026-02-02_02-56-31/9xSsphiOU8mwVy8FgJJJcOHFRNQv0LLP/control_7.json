I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The author is a husband who's uncomfortable with his wife pursuing a higher-paying career that could surpass his earnings.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would allow her to earn more than him. The husband is okay with her working but is against this specific career move because he doesn't want her to make more than him. He feels it would make him feel emasculated. They don't have kids, and his income already supports them comfortably.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the husband's personal feelings about being the primary breadwinner. The question is whether his stance is valid or if he's wrong to feel that way. \n\nFrom a traditional angle, some might argue that a spouse should support each other's ambitions regardless of financial implications. However, the husband is honest about his feelings of insecurity. But is it wrong to feel that way? It's important to consider that everyone has different values. However, societal norms are shifting towards valuing personal fulfillment and equality in partnerships over traditional gender roles.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is based on ego and traditional gender roles rather than the wife's aspirations. The wife is pursuing a path she's passionate about, and the husband is resisting it because of his own insecurities. Even though he's honest with her, his resistance might hinder her growth. The wife's decision to go to school is her right, and the husband's opposition based on personal pride could be seen as selfish.\n\nAlso, their financial situation allows for both to be employed without pressure. The husband's concern about feeling emasculated is about his self-worth being tied to income, which isn't healthy. A healthy relationship should prioritize each other's happiness and growth. The husband is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his ego over his wife's dreams and the partnership's well-being. He should support her decision even if it changes their financial roles.\n"
