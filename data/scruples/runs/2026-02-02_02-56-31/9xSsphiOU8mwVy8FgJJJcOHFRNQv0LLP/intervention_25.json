I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. First, I need to consider the key points here.\n\nThe couple is in their late 20s, have no kids, and the husband's salary is sufficient for their lifestyle. The wife currently works but makes less than half of what he does. She put her grad school plans on hold to support the couple financially while he was in his master's program. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a different career path with higher earnings than him.\n\nThe husband's main concern is feeling emasculated if his wife makes more. He acknowledges that this is an unpopular opinion but feels it's tied to his self-esteem being the breadwinner. The wife expressed a desire to pursue her dream, which is in a field she's passionate about, even though she loves her current job.\n\nI need to evaluate whether the husband's reasoning is valid. The fact that he's uncomfortable about his wife's higher earnings isn't just about financial necessity but about personal feelings related to his role as the primary earner. The wife's decision is about her career aspirations, not just financial gain. Her parents' offer to fund her education also removes the financial burden from her, which is a significant factor.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and supporting each other's goals are important. The husband is prioritizing his own insecurities over his wife's aspirations. Even though their financial situation is stable, the wife's desire to pursue further education is her personal choice. The husband's hesitation isn't based on practical concerns like financial strain or lack of opportunity but on his own feelings of masculinity and self-worth.\n\nIt's also worth noting that their previous arrangement (her working while he studied) was a mutual decision, but now she's changing her path based on new opportunities. The husband's resistance here seems rooted in personal discomfort rather than objective reasons. Supporting a partner's educational and career goals is a key aspect of a healthy relationship. His feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override her autonomy.\n\nTherefore, the husband is in the wrong for not supporting his wife's decision based on his own insecurities rather than the couple's actual needs. The answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
