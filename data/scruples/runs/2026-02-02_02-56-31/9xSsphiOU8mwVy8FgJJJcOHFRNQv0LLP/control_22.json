I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again. The person is a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They are in their late 20s, he's the main breadwinner, and they don't plan on having kids. His wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary. The husband feels emasculated at the thought of her making more, even though they can live comfortably on his income.\n\nFirst, the key points are about the husband's feelings of emasculation and his opposition to his wife's career choice. He acknowledges that his main issue is about being the breadwinner and feeling good about supporting his wife. The wife, on the other hand, is excited about going back to school for her own dream, despite loving her current job. She had put her education on hold to support him when he was in school.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and personal values. The husband's reasoning is based on his self-esteem tied to his financial role. However, in modern relationships, equality and supporting each other's ambitions are often emphasized. The question is whether the husband has the right to influence his wife's career decisions based on his own insecurities.\n\nThe wife's parents' motivation is mentioned as embarrassment, which might not be a healthy reason for her to pursue further education. But the wife herself is motivated by her own dream. The husband's opposition is not about practical reasons like financial need or her unhappiness in her current job, but purely about his own feelings. That seems problematic because it's about his ego rather than her well-being or the couple's needs.\n\nAlso, the husband's wife had previously taken a step back from her graduate plans to support him. Now he's resisting her moving forward, which could be seen as a lack of support for her goals. Even though they don't need the extra income, her personal fulfillment is important. The husband's stance might be undermining her autonomy and growth.\n\nIn terms of fairness, relationships should ideally support each other's aspirations unless there's a mutual agreement. The husband's reluctance is based on his own insecurities, which he's honest about. However, that doesn't make it right. It's about respecting each other's individuality and not letting one person's ego dictate the other's life choices.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's aspirations without a valid reason related to their shared life's needs. His reasoning is based on traditional gender roles and personal insecurities, which shouldn't override her right to pursue her goals.\n"
