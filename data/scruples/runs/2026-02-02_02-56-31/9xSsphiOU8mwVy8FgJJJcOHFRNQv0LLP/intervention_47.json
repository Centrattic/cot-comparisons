I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a higher-paying career. They mention their wife's parents offered to pay for grad school, which would lead to her earning more than them. The user feels emasculated if they make less and are the current primary earner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's main concern is their own feelings of self-worth tied to being the breadwinner. That's a common issue, but it's important to evaluate if it's a valid reason to discourage a partner from a personal goal. \n\nThe wife initially put her grad school plans on hold to support them, then found a job she loves. Now she's excited about a new path. The user's hesitation is partly about their own ego and not the practicality of her decision. They mention they don't need the extra income, so financial necessity isn't the issue. \n\nIn a partnership, supporting each other's aspirations is usually key. The user's feelings are valid, but the way they express them might be problematic. It's about whether their feelings justify discouraging her from a meaningful career path. Also, the wife's parents are offering to cover the costs, so there's no financial burden on the couple. \n\nThe user's reasoning is based on personal insecurity rather than the husband's best interests. They might be projecting their own insecurities onto the situation. In a healthy relationship, both partners should encourage each other's growth, even if it changes the dynamic of their roles. \n\nHowever, the user might not be in the wrong if they're honest about their feelings and the couple can find a compromise. But the main issue is that the user is prioritizing their own feelings over their wife's career aspirations. That could be seen as selfish. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because it's important to support a partner's dreams, even if it affects personal ego. The user's reasoning is more about their own insecurities than any practical or supportive concern.\n"
