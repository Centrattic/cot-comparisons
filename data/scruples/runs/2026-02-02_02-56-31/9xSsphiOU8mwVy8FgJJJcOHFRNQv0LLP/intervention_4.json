  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?\nI know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would surpass their salary. First, I need to consider the key points here.\n\nThe wife currently works but makes less than the user. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial necessity for her to increase her earnings. The user's main issue seems to be about their self-esteem and feeling like they're the primary breadwinner. The wife's parents offered to pay for her grad school, which could lead her to a higher-paying job in a different field.\n\nSo, the user is uncomfortable with the idea of their wife earning more. They admit it's about feeling emasculated. That's a personal feeling, but the question is whether that makes them wrong. From a societal perspective, there's a lot of pressure around traditional gender roles, but in modern times, many people advocate for equality in partnerships regardless of income. However, the user's reasoning is based on personal feelings rather than any harm to the wife.\n\nThe wife has the right to pursue her education and career goals, especially since the financial burden is on her parents. The user's opposition is based on their own insecurities, not on the wife's best interests. However, they did express concerns about her job satisfaction and the drastic change in career path. But the wife is choosing to leave her current job she loves for a different path, which seems like her own decision. \n\nThe user's main issue is their own ego. They acknowledge that they feel good about being the breadwinner. While that's a valid feeling for them, it's important to consider that their partner's aspirations shouldn't be secondary to their self-esteem. Equality in a relationship means supporting each other's growth, even if it changes the dynamics of income. \n\nThe user's position could be seen as selfish if they're prioritizing their own feelings over the wife's career aspirations. However, they do mention that they don't think any guy can feel good about making less, which is a personal belief. But the fact remains that the wife is making a choice that's in her best interest, and the user's opposition is based on personal comfort rather than objective reasons.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's feelings are valid, their stance against the wife's pursuit of a better career (even if it leads to higher earnings) is more about their own insecurities. Therefore, they might be in the wrong by not fully supporting her decision. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether their opposition is justified. Since it's not based on the wife's well-being or practical needs but their own ego, the answer leans towards 'Yes, they are in the wrong'.\n"
