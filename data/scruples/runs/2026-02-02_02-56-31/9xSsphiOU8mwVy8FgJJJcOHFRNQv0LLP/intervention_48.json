  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?\nI know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The main points are:\n\n1. He's the primary earner, and she currently makes less. They live comfortably on his salary alone.\n2. She put her grad school plans on hold when he was in school, so they can support each other. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad degree.\n3. He's concerned about being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated if she makes more. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial need for her to earn more.\n\nFirst, traditional gender roles might play a role here. The user feels traditional expectations of being the breadwinner are important to his self-esteem. But modern relationships often emphasize equality and mutual support rather than one partner being the sole provider.\n\nThe wife is considering a career change she's passionate about. Her parents are supporting her education financially, which is a positive. The user's main issue seems to be his own ego and insecurities rather than practical concerns like financial stability. Since they don't need the extra income, his objection is more about personal feelings.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider mutual respect in a relationship. Supporting each other's goals is key. The user's hesitation might stem from a fear of change or feeling less valued. It's possible he's projecting his self-worth onto their relationship dynamics.\n\nThe fact that she's excited about her dream and the opportunity is a strong point in her favor. If he's preventing her from pursuing her passion due to his own insecurities, that could be seen as selfish. Healthier relationships prioritize the partner's aspirations unless there are valid, mutual concerns.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of their past. She delayed her education to support him, which shows sacrifice. Now she's considering her own path. It's a shift in roles, but if she's genuinely interested in this new direction, it's her right to pursue it.\n\nThe user's feelings of emasculation need addressing. It's okay to have these feelings, but acting on them by discouraging her might not be fair. They should communicate openly, find a way to support each other's needs, and maybe work on his self-esteem issues outside the relationship context.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user is prioritizing his own ego over his wife's personal growth. That's a classic sign of being in the wrong. Relationships should encourage each other's success, not hinder it for ego's sake.\n"
