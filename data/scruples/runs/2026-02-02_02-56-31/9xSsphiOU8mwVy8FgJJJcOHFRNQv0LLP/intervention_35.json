I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him. They mention that he's the primary breadwinner, and he feels emasculated at the thought of making less. The wife is considering grad school, which her parents are funding, and he's against it because of his feelings about financial roles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The user admits that his main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. That's a red flag because it shows his self-worth is tied to his income relative to his partner's. In healthy relationships, supporting each other's growth is key. If he's discouraging her from a path she's excited about just because of his ego, that's problematic.\n\nHe also mentions that they live comfortably on his salary alone and don't plan to have kids. So there's no financial necessity for her to earn more. But the wife loves her current job, so why is she considering a drastic career change? He says she's interested in her dream, which might be in a different field. If she's genuinely passionate about this new path, it's her right to pursue it, even if it changes the financial dynamic.\n\nHis argument that he likes being the breadwinner is a traditional view that might not align with modern values of equality. The idea that a man should be the main earner can lead to controlling behavior. The fact that he's resisting her choice because of his own pride could be seen as self-centered. He's not considering her aspirations for her own sake, just trying to maintain a certain status in their relationship.\n\nAlso, the wife made sacrifices before by putting her grad school on hold to support them. Now she's considering it again, and he's discouraging her. That could be perceived as unfair, especially since her parents are offering to fund it. His reaction might be undermining her autonomy and her previous contributions.\n\nThe user's reasoning is rooted in personal insecurity rather than practical concerns. The question is whether it's right to prioritize one's ego over a partner's dreams. In most ethical frameworks, supporting a partner's personal growth is essential. So, yes, the user is in the wrong for not supporting her decision based on his own insecurities.\n"
