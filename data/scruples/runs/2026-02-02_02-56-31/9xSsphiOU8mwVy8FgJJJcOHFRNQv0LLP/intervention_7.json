  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?\nI know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They mention that they're in their late 20s, she currently makes less than half of his salary, and they don't plan to have kids. Her parents offered to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary.\n\nFirst, the user's main concern is feeling emasculated if he's not the primary breadwinner anymore. He acknowledges that his feelings are about his own ego, which is important. The wife, on the other hand, wants to pursue her dream, even though she loves her current job. She's been supportive of him during his master's, so there's a history of mutual support.\n\nI need to consider if his reasoning is valid. It's his right to feel a certain way about his role, but does that justify preventing her from making her own career choices? Her parents are supporting her education, which is a good opportunity. The user is living comfortably, so financial need isn't an issue here. The wife's happiness and personal goals should be a priority. The user's feelings stem from societal expectations, but maybe they should focus on their relationship dynamics instead of traditional gender roles. The answer should address whether his reasons are selfish and if he's respecting her autonomy.\n"
