I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a guy who makes enough money for him and his wife to live comfortably. His wife currently works but makes less than half of what he does. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no need for her to work more. While he was getting his master's, his wife (then his girlfriend) put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time and support them. She found a job she loved and stopped talking about grad school. The author thought she would stay in that job until retirement.\n\nNow, her wealthy parents offered to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than the author. The wife is excited about this, but the author is against it. He's not happy because he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less. He's worried about his self-esteem if his wife makes more. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's feelings about being the primary provider, his wife's career choices, and the dynamics of their relationship. The key issue seems to be the author's discomfort with his wife earning more than him, which he admits is due to feeling emasculated. \n\nI need to consider if his feelings are valid or if they make him wrong. Society is moving more towards equal partnership in relationships, and traditionally, the man being the breadwinner was more common, but that's changing. The author's stance might be seen as outdated or reinforcing traditional gender roles. The wife is making a choice that's good for her career and interests, and the author is opposing it for reasons related to his self-worth.\n\nHowever, the author isn't against the idea in general. He's concerned because he's used to being the provider and the role shift might affect his self-esteem. But is it wrong to have those feelings? Or is it about how he's handling them? The wife's parents are funding her education, so there's no financial burden on the author. The wife is pursuing a dream, which is a valid reason. The author's main objection seems to be his own insecurity rather than practical reasons.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at whether the person is being reasonable or if their actions are harmful. If the author is preventing his wife from pursuing her goals due to his own ego, that's problematic. The wife's career choice is her right, and the author's feelings should not override her aspirations. Even though he's not forcing her, his disapproval could affect her decision or their relationship dynamic. \n\nAlso, the fact that they don't need the money for practical reasons (like kids) makes the author's concern seem more about ego than necessity. The wife's happiness and personal growth are important, and the author's stance might be hindering that. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author is in the wrong because his feelings about being the breadwinner are causing him to oppose his wife's legitimate career goals without valid reasons. His insecurity is affecting their relationship and her autonomy. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
