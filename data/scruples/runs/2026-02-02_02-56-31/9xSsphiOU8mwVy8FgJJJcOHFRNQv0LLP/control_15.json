I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about him not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband makes more than enough for them to live comfortably. The wife currently works but earns less than half of what he does. She put her grad school plans on hold when he was in school to support them financially. Now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than his current one. He's against it because he likes being the main breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less. They don't plan to have kids.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet's think about the dynamics here. The husband's reasoning is based on his own feelings of self-worth tied to being the higher earner. However, this could be problematic because it might be controlling or limit his wife's aspirations. The wife is considering a path she's passionate about, even though it's a different field. Her parents are supporting her financially, so there's no financial burden on the couple. \n\nOn one hand, the husband's discomfort with not being the higher earner is a personal issue. It's a traditional view that might not be fair to the wife. On the other hand, he's not forbidding her; he's just expressing his concerns. But is it his place to influence her decision based on his ego?\n\nAlso, the wife previously put her education on hold for his studies, which might mean she's now trying to pursue her own goals. He should support her autonomy. The fact that he's not stopping her but is still unhappy might lead to resentment. \n\nSocietal expectations play a role here. The husband's feelings about being the breadwinner are traditional, but in modern relationships, such views can be seen as outdated. The wife's career choice shouldn't be restricted by her partner's insecurities. \n\nHowever, the husband isn't being abusive; he's sharing his feelings. The problem is whether his feelings justify discouraging her. Since she's making a choice that benefits her personally and there's no financial need, his resistance seems based on ego rather than practical concerns. \n\nIn most ethical discussions, supporting a partner's aspirations is considered important unless there are valid concerns (like financial strain). Here, there's no financial pressure, so his objection is purely about his own feelings. That makes him wrong in the sense that he's not respecting her autonomy and personal goals for his own sake. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (he is in the wrong) because his reasons are selfish and based on insecurity rather than her well-being.\n"
