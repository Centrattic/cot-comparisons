I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They mention that they're in their late 20s, he's the primary income earner, and they don't plan on having kids. His wife's parents offered to pay for her grad school, which could lead her to a higher salary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The man is concerned about being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated if she makes more. That's a common concern for some people, but it's also a traditional view that might not align with modern gender roles. However, the user isn't just against her career for practical reasons; it's more about his ego and self-worth tied to his income compared to hers. \n\nThe wife made a sacrifice by putting her grad school plans on hold to support the couple financially when he was in school. Now, she's considering returning to school for her own aspirations, and he's resisting. The question is whether his opposition is valid or if he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, a person's career choices should be based on their own aspirations and opportunities, not the partner's ego. The fact that her parents are funding the education removes financial burden on the couple, so it's not about money. Also, the user says they live comfortably on his salary, so there's no necessity for her to work. But she wants to pursue her dream, which is a valid reason. \n\nHowever, the user's feelings are real, and communication is key in a relationship. He did express his concerns, and she could be considering them while making her decision. The issue is whether his objection is self-centered. If the wife's happiness and goals are important, then allowing her to pursue this might be the right thing, even if it makes him uncomfortable. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. He could support her decision even if it's hard for him, as a sign of respecting her autonomy. On the other hand, if he's truly not supportive and it causes conflict, that could be a problem. The question is whether his stance is wrong. \n\nTraditional views might say that supporting a partner's career is important, and that his feelings of emasculation are a personal issue to work through. Modern perspectives would likely side with the wife's right to pursue her goals. So, the answer might lean towards AITA being \"Yes\" (A), because his main reason is about his own feelings rather than practical concerns. But maybe there's nuance. \n\nHe did mention that her career path is different, but she loves her current job and might be changing fields. However, she's excited about this new path. If the program is a good fit for her, then it's her decision. His resistance is based on his ego, which is a personal shortcoming. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than the couple's best interests. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
