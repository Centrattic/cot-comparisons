I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a man in his late 20s, married, and his wife also in the same age range. He makes enough to support both of them comfortably, and his wife currently works but earns less than half of his salary. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no need for increased income. However, his wife's wealthy parents are offering to pay for her graduate education, which would put her on a career path earning more than the author. The wife was previously interested in grad school but put it off to support him during his master's. Now she's excited about going back, but the author is against it because he's worried about being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated if she makes more.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about the author's feelings of insecurity regarding his role as the primary earner. The wife is considering a career change that she's passionate about, with financial support from her parents. The author's main issue isn't about the career itself but his own ego and self-worth tied to being the higher earner.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, traditional gender roles might suggest that the man should be the breadwinner, but modern relationships often emphasize equality and mutual support. The author's concern is based on personal feelings rather than any logical necessity since they don't need more money. The wife is making a decision that could fulfill her personal goals, and the author is resisting it due to his own insecurities.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife's choice to pursue her education and career is her own, especially with the financial support from her parents. The author's opposition is based on his emotional response, not on practical reasons like financial strain. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important, even if it means adjusting roles. The author's feeling of emasculation is a personal issue that he needs to address, but it's not a valid reason to discourage his wife from pursuing her ambitions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his objections are rooted in ego rather than the wife's best interests or the couple's actual needs.\n"
