I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: They're in their late 20s, have a comfortable income from his salary alone, and they don't plan to have kids. The wife currently works but makes less. She had put grad school on hold to support them financially when he was in school. Now her wealthy parents offer to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a different career path with higher income than his. He's feeling emasculated at the thought of her making more, even though they can already live comfortably.\n\nHe admits that his main issue is about being the breadwinner and not wanting to feel emasculated. The question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFrom a fairness and equality standpoint, it's important that a marriage should support each other's aspirations. If the wife wants to pursue her dream and her parents can help financially, that's a positive. His concern about feeling emasculated is a personal insecurity. In healthy relationships, couples should encourage each other's growth, regardless of financial implications. His opposition seems based on self-esteem rather than practical reasons. Even though they can live comfortably, her personal fulfillment is a valid reason to pursue her goals. He might be projecting his own feelings onto the relationship, which isn't fair to her. So, in this context, he's in the wrong because his feelings shouldn't dictate her career choices. The answer is A.\n"
