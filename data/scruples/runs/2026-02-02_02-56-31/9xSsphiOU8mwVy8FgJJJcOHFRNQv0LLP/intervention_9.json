I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They mention that they're in their late 20s, he's the main breadwinner, and they don't plan to have kids. His wife is considering going back to grad school, which her parents are paying for, and this would lead her to a higher salary. The man feels emasculated at the thought of making less than her, even though they can live comfortably on his income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife put her grad school on hold to support the couple financially when he was getting his master's. Now she's interested in pursuing it again, which is her personal goal. Her parents' offer is a financial enabler here. The husband's main issue is about his ego\u2014feeling that being the higher earner is important to his self-esteem. \n\nThe question is whether his feelings make him \"in the wrong.\" In modern relationships, there's a lot of emphasis on equality and mutual support. If the wife is pursuing her dream and it's feasible without financial strain, the husband's resistance based on his ego might be problematic. He's prioritizing his feelings over her aspirations. Also, the fact that they don't need the extra income doesn't negate her right to pursue her goals. \n\nBut there are nuances. He's honest about his feelings, which is a good sign. He's not trying to control her but admits it's his insecurity. However, supporting a partner's career growth is typically seen as important in a healthy relationship. The husband's stance could be seen as selfish, even if his intentions aren't malicious. \n\nAnother point is that the wife might feel conflicted. She already made a sacrifice before, and now her partner is hesitant again. The husband's reaction could affect their dynamic. It's important that both partners feel supported in their individual goals. The fact that the husband's job is doing fine and they don't need the extra money means the financial aspect isn't the main issue. \n\nIn terms of societal views, traditional gender roles are less emphasized these days. The husband's concern about being \"emasculated\" might be based on outdated notions. The wife's decision to pursue her education is a personal choice and a step towards her fulfillment. The husband needs to consider if his feelings are valid or if they stem from societal pressures rather than their actual relationship needs.\n\nSo putting this together, the husband's resistance is based on his own insecurities rather than practical reasons. The wife's career growth is her right, and the husband's stance could be seen as not fully supporting her. Therefore, the answer would likely be AITA, meaning he's in the wrong. But wait, the options are A for yes (he's in the wrong) and B for no. So if the consensus is that his feelings are valid but he should still support her, maybe the answer is B. But given that his support is conditional on his ego, probably A. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if they're in the wrong. The key factors are: the wife's right to pursue her goals, the husband's valid feelings, and whether his opposition is justified. Since their financial situation allows it, and the wife is motivated by her own dreams, the husband's resistance is based on personal insecurity. Therefore, he's in the wrong for prioritizing his ego over her aspirations. So answer A.\n"
