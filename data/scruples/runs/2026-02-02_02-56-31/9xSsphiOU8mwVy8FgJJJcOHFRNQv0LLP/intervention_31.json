I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them. They mention that they're in their late 20s, they're the primary breadwinner, their wife works but makes less, and they don't plan to have kids. Her parents offered to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than the husband's. The husband is uncomfortable with the idea of her making more than him, feeling emasculated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the husband's reasoning is valid. The main issue here seems to be his emotional response to being the lower earner. The wife wants to pursue her dream, which is supported by her parents. The husband is against it, not because of financial necessity (since they live comfortably) but because of his own ego. \n\nIs it wrong to feel emasculated by making less? Well, societal norms have been changing, and many people believe that a person's worth isn't tied to income. However, the husband is being honest about his feelings. But is that a valid reason to prevent his wife from pursuing her goals? The wife already made a sacrifice by putting her grad school plans on hold to support the relationship financially. Now, she has an opportunity to advance her career, which she's excited about. Her parents are supporting her, so the financial burden isn't on the couple. \n\nThe husband's argument is about his own feelings of emasculation, but it's important to consider if his opinion is based on insecurity or outdated gender roles. The wife's autonomy and career aspirations are significant here. If the husband is blocking her from her goals because of his own ego, that's a red flag. Respecting each other's ambitions is crucial in a relationship. The husband might need to reflect on whether his feelings are something he can work through or if they're a barrier to his wife's happiness and growth.\n\nAlso, the couple doesn't need the extra income, so the financial aspect isn't a concern. The husband's reason is purely emotional, which is his personal issue, but it shouldn't override his wife's desires. The wife has already made sacrifices for the relationship; now she's pursuing her own path, which is understandable. The husband's response might be seen as controlling or dismissive of her ambitions. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than the couple's needs. Supporting each other's growth is key in a relationship. So, the answer would likely be that he is in the wrong (A) because he's prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations, even though the situation is complex.\n"
