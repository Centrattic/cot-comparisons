I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife and husband are in their late 20s. The husband earns enough to support them both comfortably. The wife currently works but makes less than half of his salary. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial need for her to earn more. \n\nThe wife had put her grad school plans on hold when he was in school, and she found a job she loves. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than the husband's. The husband is against it because he feels emasculated if he makes less than her, even though they can live comfortably on his income. \n\nThe key points here are the husband's reasons. He's not concerned about financial stability but rather his own ego and the traditional role of being the breadwinner. The wife is excited about her dream and the opportunity. The husband's opposition seems based on personal feelings rather than practical reasons. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for each person to support the other's goals and dreams. The husband's reluctance is rooted in insecurity, which could affect the relationship dynamics. Even though the financial situation is stable, the wife's desire to pursue her passion and achieve her goals is a valid reason to consider the opportunity. \n\nThe husband might need to work on his self-esteem and rethink the value of mutual support in a relationship. It's not about who earns more but about both contributing in ways that make them happy. The wife's parents' support removes the financial burden, making her decision more about her personal aspirations. \n\nTherefore, the husband is in the wrong because his opposition is based on his insecurities rather than supporting his wife's growth and happiness.\n"
