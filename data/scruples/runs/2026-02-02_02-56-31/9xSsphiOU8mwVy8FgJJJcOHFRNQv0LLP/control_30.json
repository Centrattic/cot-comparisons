I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a man) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation involves his wife's potential to go to grad school, which her wealthy parents are funding, leading her to possibly switch careers. The author's main concern is that he feels emasculated if she makes more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife already made a sacrifice earlier by putting her grad school plans on hold to support the author while he got his master's. Now, she's considering going back to school again, which is a big commitment. The author is against it because he feels his self-worth is tied to being the primary breadwinner. That's a personal issue, but it's affecting his wife's career aspirations.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a fairness perspective, a spouse shouldn't block another's career growth just because of personal insecurities. The wife's parents are offering to pay, so it's not a financial burden on them. The author's argument that they don't need more money because they live comfortably is valid, but career decisions aren't just about money\u2014they're about personal fulfillment and goals. The author's feelings of emasculation are his problem, but he's projecting that onto his wife's choices.\n\nHowever, there's a part where the author acknowledges his own feelings and the wife's previous sacrifice. But the core issue is whether his feelings justify him opposing her pursuit. It's a conflict between personal insecurities and a partner's aspirations. Societal norms might suggest that this is a dated view where the man is expected to be the sole breadwinner, but in modern relationships, mutual support is key. The author's stance could be seen as selfish or controlling, even if unintentionally. So, the answer would likely be A, meaning the author is in the wrong because he's not supporting his wife's ambitions due to his own ego.\n"
