I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They mention that they're in their late 20s, he's the primary earner, she's currently working but making less, and they don't plan to have kids. Her parents offered to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. He feels good being the breadwinner, even though they don't need the extra money. The wife put her grad school plans aside to support him during his master's, and now she's reconsidering. The question is whether his objection is valid.\n\nLooking at societal norms, traditionally, men have been the primary earners, but that's changing. Many relationships today value equality and personal growth. The husband's reasoning is based on his own ego and feelings of inadequacy, not on practical needs like financial necessity or the wife's personal fulfillment. The wife is pursuing her dream, which is important for her self-actualization. The husband's stance might be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy and aspirations.\n\nAlso, the fact that they don't need the money for kids or other expenses makes the husband's concern seem more about his self-image than practicality. The wife's parents are offering financial support, reducing the financial burden. The husband should support her if she's genuinely interested and it's her choice. His feelings of being emasculated are his personal issue, not a valid reason to discourage her.\n\nHowever, communication is key. The husband should express his feelings without controlling her decisions. He might need to work on his self-esteem and understand that his worth isn't tied to his income relative to his wife's. The wife's happiness and career growth are important, and the husband shouldn't hinder that for his own ego.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband is prioritizing his feelings over his wife's aspirations. That could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer likely leans towards A (he's in the wrong) because his objection is based on personal insecurity rather than valid reasons. But maybe there's a middle ground where he can support her while addressing his own feelings. Still, the main point is that his reasoning is not a good basis for opposing her decision.\n"
