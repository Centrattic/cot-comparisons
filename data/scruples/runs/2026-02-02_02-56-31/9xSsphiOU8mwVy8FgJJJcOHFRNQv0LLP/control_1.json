I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a man in his late 20s who's married. His wife works but earns less than him. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial necessity for her to make more. Her parents offered to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to earn more than him. The author is against this because he feels good about being the primary breadwinner and would feel emasculated if she made more. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main points. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her education, which is a significant opportunity for her. She had put her grad school plans on hold to support him during his master's, which might mean she's now considering this path again. The author's main objection is based on his own feelings about being the main earner, which he admits makes him feel good. \n\nThe question here is whether his feelings are a valid reason to discourage his wife from pursuing her educational and career goals. From a feminist or egalitarian perspective, it would be problematic if someone is limiting a partner's career aspirations based on their own ego. The wife has the chance to pursue her interests and potentially increase her income, which is her right. The author's reasoning seems to be rooted in traditional gender roles where the man is the provider, which is an outdated and harmful belief in many contexts. \n\nHowever, the couple's situation is that they don't need the money, so it's not about financial necessity. The author is acknowledging that they live comfortably on his income alone. So his opposition isn't based on practical reasons but on his own insecurities. This could be seen as selfish or controlling, as he's prioritizing his self-esteem over his wife's aspirations. \n\nIt's also important to note that the wife's parents are supporting her education, which might mean she has other family support. The author is the only one opposing this. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals unless there are mutual agreements. The author's feelings are his own, but they shouldn't override her desires. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author did talk to her about it, but his main concern was about her career path changing, not about the financial aspect. However, his real reason was admitting to feeling emasculated. That's a personal issue that he might need to address, perhaps through self-reflection or therapy, rather than imposing on his wife's choices. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because his opposition is based on his own ego and outdated notions of masculinity, not on the couple's actual needs or his wife's well-being. The wife has the right to pursue her education and career, especially when financial needs aren't an issue. The author should support her decision for her growth rather than let his insecurities dictate their relationship dynamics.\n"
