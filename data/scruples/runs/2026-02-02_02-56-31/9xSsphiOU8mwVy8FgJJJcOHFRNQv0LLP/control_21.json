I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career because he feels emasculated if he makes less than her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband's main concern is his ego and the dynamics of being the breadwinner. He acknowledges that his wife could go to grad school, which her parents are funding, and that she's interested in a different career path. He's worried about making less money, even though their current finances are comfortable and they don't plan to have kids.\n\nThe wife had previously put her grad school plans on hold to support their life, so now she's considering it again. The husband's opposition isn't based on practical reasons like financial strain but rather his own feelings about being the primary earner. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, supporting each other's ambitions is generally considered important. The husband's reluctance seems to stem from insecurity rather than any objective need. Even though he's comfortable with the current setup, stifling his wife's growth for his own ego might be problematic. \n\nAlso, the fact that they don't plan to have kids means financial necessity isn't a factor. The husband's reasoning about feeling emasculated is a personal feeling but doesn't justify discouraging his wife from her goals. Healthy relationships encourage mutual support, so the husband's stance could be seen as selfish. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own insecurities over his wife's aspirations without valid reasons.\n"
