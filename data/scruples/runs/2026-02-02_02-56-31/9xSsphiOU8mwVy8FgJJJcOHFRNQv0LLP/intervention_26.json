I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They're a young couple in their late 20s. He makes enough to live comfortably, and she works but earns less than half. They don't plan on having kids. His wife put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time and support them. Now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary than him. He's uncomfortable with the idea because he's used to being the breadwinner and feels emasculated at the thought of making less.\n\nHmm, the key points here are his feelings about being the breadwinner and his wife's desire to pursue her dream. Let's consider the dynamics. The wife had already chosen to prioritize their current financial stability by not going to grad school before. Now she's excited about this new opportunity. The user's main objection is about his own ego and the societal expectation of being the higher earner.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, supporting each other's goals is crucial. If the wife wants to pursue something she loves and has the means to do so (thanks to her parents' support), shouldn't he encourage her? His hesitation is based on personal insecurities rather than practical reasons. The financial aspect isn't an issue since they're already living comfortably. So, his main concern is his self-worth tied to income, which is a personal issue.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. He did talk to her about his concerns, but maybe not deeply enough. It's possible he didn't consider how his stance might affect her. The wife might feel unsupported if he's against her dreams just because of his feelings. In healthy relationships, partners support each other's aspirations unless there's a valid, shared concern. Here, the concern is his ego, not a practical problem like financial strain or incompatible goals.\n\nAlso, the fact that her parents are offering to cover the costs removes the financial burden on them. The career path is different, but she loves her job now. Maybe she's ready for a change, and that's her prerogative. His resistance seems to stem from personal feelings rather than objective reasons related to their relationship or future.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, if a partner's personal insecurities prevent them from supporting the other's aspirations, especially when there's no negative impact on the relationship, that's a red flag. The answer here would lean towards the user being in the wrong because his objections are based on his own ego rather than the well-being of his wife or their relationship.\n"
