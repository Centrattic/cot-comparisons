I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to pursue a graduate degree that would lead her to earn more than him, even though they can live comfortably on his salary. The key factors here are his feelings of emasculation and the wife's desire to follow her dream.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support the couple financially while he was in school. Now, with her parents offering to pay for her education, she's excited about a new path. The husband's main objection is about his self-esteem being tied to being the higher earner, which seems more about his own ego than practical financial needs.\n\nThe user is asking if he's at fault. In modern relationships, supporting each other's career aspirations is often seen as important. The husband's hesitation is based on personal feelings rather than the couple's financial necessity. Since they don't need the extra income, his resistance seems more about his own insecurities. That could be seen as selfish or not supporting his partner's goals.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is making a significant life decision that could change their dynamic. However, the husband's reason for opposing it is about his own feelings of worth, which is a personal issue. Healthy relationships typically require partners to encourage each other's growth, even if it changes traditional roles.\n\nSo, the husband's stance might be considered wrong because it prioritizes his own ego over his wife's aspirations. The fact that they can afford her education and that his objections are based on his self-esteem, not financial need, points towards him being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he is in the wrong).\n"
