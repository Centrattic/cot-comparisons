I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They mention that they're both in their late 20s, he's the main earner, they don't plan on having kids, and his wife previously put her grad school plans on hold. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The man is concerned about feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. That's a big red flag. It suggests that his self-esteem is tied to being the higher earner, which isn't a healthy mindset. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's growth and career aspirations without letting it affect their self-worth. \n\nThe wife had already decided to put her education on hold to support the relationship financially. Now she's excited about a new opportunity. The husband is resistant not because of practical reasons (like financial need) but because of his own ego. They don't need more money since he's already making enough for both. So his objection is purely based on personal pride, not the couple's financial security.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's parents' motivation. They might feel embarrassed about their daughter not having a graduate degree, which could add pressure on her. The husband's resistance might be adding to that pressure, making it harder for her to make an independent decision. A supportive partner would be excited for her growth, regardless of salary.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning that no man can feel good about being less than his partner financially is a bit of a generalization. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and support, not on financial dominance. By not supporting her, he's potentially undermining her autonomy and career goals. \n\nThe wife's desire to pursue her dream career is valid. She loves her current job but is considering a different path she's passionate about. The husband's lack of support could lead to resentment on her part, making her feel like her aspirations are secondary to his ego. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's stance is based on his own insecurities rather than the couple's actual needs. He's not wrong in feeling conflicted, but his response is problematic because it doesn't support his wife's personal growth. Therefore, the answer is that he is in the wrong.\n"
