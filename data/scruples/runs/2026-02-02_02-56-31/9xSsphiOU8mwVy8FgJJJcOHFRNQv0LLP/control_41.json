I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The key points here are about self-esteem, financial dynamics, and mutual respect in the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is okay financially, making enough for both of them. His wife had put her graduate school plans on hold to support him during his studies. Now, with her parents offering to cover all expenses, she wants to go back to school for a different career path that could earn more than him. The author is uncomfortable because he's used to being the sole breadwinner and fears feeling emasculated.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's reasoning. He's not against her career growth because of logical reasons like financial need or job stability, but rather due to his own ego. Valuing self-worth based on being the higher earner in a relationship can be problematic. It's important for both partners to support each other's goals and growth, regardless of financial implications. The wife's decision to pursue her dream is her right, especially since they don't have kids and the financial situation is stable. The husband's reluctance is more about his own insecurities rather than the couple's needs. This could lead to resentment or hinder the wife's personal development. So, the author is in the wrong because his stance is based on personal insecurities rather than mutual support and respect.\n"
