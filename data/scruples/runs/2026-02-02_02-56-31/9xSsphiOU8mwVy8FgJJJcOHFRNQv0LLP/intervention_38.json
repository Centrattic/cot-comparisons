  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?\nI know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a higher-paying career. The main issue here seems to be their own feelings about being the breadwinner and potential feelings of emasculation if their wife makes more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife already made a sacrifice by putting her grad school plans on hold to support the user during their master's. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her education. The user is against it because they don't want to make less than her, even though they say they can live comfortably on their salary alone. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the wife should have the freedom to pursue her own goals and dreams. The user's hesitation is based on their own ego or societal expectations rather than the wife's best interests. Financially, the user claims they can support both, so the practical need isn't there. However, the emotional aspect is important. The user feels uncomfortable with the idea of being the lower earner, which might indicate some insecurity or traditional gender role expectations.\n\nBut the user did mention they were open to discussion and backed off when the wife expressed her desire. However, the real issue is the underlying reason for their opposition. If the user's primary concern is their own feelings rather than the wife's happiness or practical needs, that's where the problem lies. It's about respecting each other's autonomy. The wife has the right to pursue her education and career, especially since it's her dream and her parents are covering the costs. \n\nAnother angle is the initial sacrifice the wife made. She gave up her plans for the user's education. Now, the user is resisting her new opportunity. That could be seen as selfish, not wanting her to achieve something she wants because it affects their ego. \n\nIn many relationships, mutual support is key. If the user is hindering their partner's growth for personal reasons, that's a problem. The user's concern about feeling emasculated is valid in the sense of their personal feelings, but it shouldn't override the wife's aspirations. Plus, the user's argument that they can live comfortably on their salary might make the financial concern less of an issue, focusing more on the emotional aspect.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is in the wrong because they are prioritizing their own insecurities over their wife's goals. Even if they're not happy about it, supporting each other's ambitions is a fundamental part of a healthy relationship. The answer would be A (I am in the wrong).\n"
