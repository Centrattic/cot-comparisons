I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a graduate degree that would lead her to earn more than him. He mentions that they live comfortably on his salary alone, and they don't plan on having kids. His wife had put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time when he was in school. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her education again, and she's excited about switching careers. The author is concerned about feeling emasculated if she makes more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife had made a sacrifice to support the author during his studies, and now she's choosing to pursue her own dreams. The husband's main issue seems to be about ego\u2014feeling that his role as the primary breadwinner is threatened. The question is whether his feelings justify preventing her from making a choice that's right for her.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the wife has the right to pursue her education and career goals, especially since financial support isn't an issue. The husband's reluctance is based on personal feelings of insecurity rather than practical reasons like financial necessity. It's also important to note that the husband was the one who initially benefited from the wife's support during his studies. Now, he's resisting her similar step for himself.\n\nSociety is moving towards valuing individual choices and equality in relationships. The husband's stance might stem from traditional gender roles that prioritize male financial dominance. However, in a modern, equitable relationship, both partners should support each other's ambitions regardless of income levels. The husband's insecurity here could lead to resentment or conflict if not addressed.\n\nAnother angle is whether the husband's opposition is valid. If the wife is genuinely happy in her current job but excited about a new path, her fulfillment matters more than the husband's ego. The husband's argument about feeling \"good enough\" is subjective and doesn't consider the wife's aspirations. Relationships should encourage mutual growth, not stifle each other's potential due to personal insecurities.\n\nI should also consider if there's any valid concern. The husband mentions that the career path is drastically different, so maybe there's a risk of her not enjoying it. However, he acknowledges she loves her current job but wants to pursue a dream. The wife's decision should be respected unless there's a compelling reason against it, which the husband hasn't provided beyond his own feelings.\n\nIn summary, the husband's main issue is his own insecurities about being the higher earner. The wife's choice to advance her education and career is her right, especially with financial support from her parents. The husband's opposition is based on ego rather than practicality, making him the one in the wrong.\n"
