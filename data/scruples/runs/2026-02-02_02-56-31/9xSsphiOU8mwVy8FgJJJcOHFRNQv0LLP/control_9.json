I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the context: They're in their late 20s, he earns more, she works but less. They have no kids. She put her grad school plans on hold when he was getting his degree. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school in a field that could make her earn more than him. He's against it because he feels like being the breadwinner is important to his self-esteem and doesn't want to feel emasculated.\n\nSo, the key points here. He's admitting that his main reason is about his own ego and not wanting to make less. He's aware he makes enough for them. She's interested in her dream, even though it's a different path. The parents are offering financial support, so there's no financial burden on them. She previously put her education aside for his studies, now she's considering her own.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms. Emasculating feelings are outdated, but personal feelings are still personal. However, relationships should ideally support each other's growth. If he's preventing her from pursuing a career she loves because of his ego, that's a problem. Even if it's his opinion, it's his opinion affecting her decisions. Also, they're in a position where they don't need the extra money, so it's not about necessity for them.\n\nAnother angle: They don't have kids, so she doesn't need to stay home. If she wants to go to grad school, it's her right. His support is important, but if he's opposing it for his own feelings, that's a red flag. Healthy relationships prioritize each other's happiness and goals. If his self-worth is tied to being the higher earner, that's an issue he needs to address, but he shouldn't block her from her aspirations.\n\nAlso, the fact that her parents are offering to cover the costs means there's no financial strain. So the practical argument against it isn't there. His resistance is purely emotional. That makes his stance more about his own insecurities rather than her benefit.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife made a sacrifice before for his studies. Now she's pursuing her own, which is a natural progression. If he's against it, he's not respecting her autonomy. Even if he's honest about his feelings, he's still not allowing her to make her own choice freely. So, yes, he's in the wrong because his personal feelings are hindering her growth, especially when there's no necessity involved.\n"
