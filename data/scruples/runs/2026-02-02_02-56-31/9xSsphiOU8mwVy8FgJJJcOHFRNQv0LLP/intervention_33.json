  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?\nI know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. First, I need to consider the context. They're in their late 20s, he's the primary earner, and they don't plan to have kids. His wife is considering grad school, which could lead her to earn more than him. The user feels emasculated at the thought of her making more, even though they're financially stable.\n\nSo, key points here: his personal feelings about being the breadwinner versus her career aspirations. The user admits he's uncomfortable with her making more, which he terms as feeling emasculated. But is that a valid reason to discourage her? The wife has already put her education on hold to support him during his studies, and now she's excited about this opportunity. Her parents are offering to cover the costs, which removes the financial burden on the couple.\n\nI should consider the dynamics of their relationship. The user's main concern is his own ego, not their financial stability. Since they don't need more money, her higher salary wouldn't affect their lifestyle. However, supporting a partner's career is generally seen as important in a healthy relationship. The user's resistance might come off as controlling or self-centered, focusing on his feelings rather than her aspirations and growth.\n\nAlso, the wife's decision to pursue her dream is a significant personal choice. Even though he's concerned about the salary, the fact that she loves her current job but wants to pursue another path shows her dedication to her own goals. The user's reaction could be seen as undermining her autonomy and ambitions.\n\nOn the other hand, he did consider her feelings and backed off when she expressed her desire, which is a positive step. But his underlying reason is based on self-esteem issues rather than practical reasons. It's important to question whether his feelings are his problem to work through rather than an issue that should influence her career choices.\n\nIn relationships, mutual support is key. If he can't support her decision for genuine reasons (like financial instability or other practical concerns), then he might need to address his own insecurities. However, if his only issue is about being the higher earner, that's more about his self-perception than their actual circumstances.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the user might be in the wrong because his resistance is based on his own ego rather than supporting his wife's aspirations. The answer would lean towards \"A\" (he's in the wrong), but I need to make sure there aren't other factors. The wife's parents covering the costs is a plus, but the main issue is his personal feelings vs her autonomy.\n"
