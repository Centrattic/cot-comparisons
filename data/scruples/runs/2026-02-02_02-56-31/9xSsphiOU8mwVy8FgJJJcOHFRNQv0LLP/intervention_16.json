I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a higher-paying career because they don't want to make less than her. They mention they're in their late 20s, their wife works but makes less than half of his salary, and their parents are offering to pay for her grad school. The key points here are the user's feelings about being the breadwinner and their possible emasculating feelings if their wife earns more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The wife already took a step back from grad school before to support him financially. Now, she's considering it again, which seems to be her personal choice. The user's main concern is about their own ego and societal expectations. They feel that their role as the primary earner gives them a sense of value in the relationship. However, in a modern context, financial roles in a partnership are often based on mutual support rather than traditional gender roles. \n\nThe user's statement about feeling \"good enough\" if they make less than their wife suggests a possible insecurity based on outdated notions of masculinity. It's important to note that a person's worth shouldn't be tied to their salary. The wife is pursuing her own dream, which is valid. The user might be projecting their own feelings onto the situation, not considering their wife's aspirations.\n\nAlso, the couple doesn't plan on having kids, so the necessity of higher income isn't there. But the wife's desire for personal growth and career change isn't negated by that. The user's hesitation is rooted in their own emotional reaction rather than the couple's actual financial needs. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife is being supported by her parents, which removes the financial burden from the user. The user's main issue is with the idea of their wife earning more, which might indicate an underlying problem with their self-esteem or the relationship's equality. They should be supportive of her goals, even if it changes their dynamic. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because their resistance is based on personal insecurities rather than objective reasons. The wife's autonomy and career aspirations are important, and the user's feelings of emasculation don't justify opposing her choices.\n"
