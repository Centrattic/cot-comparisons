I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They make enough to live comfortably, and their wife works but earns less. She was supposed to put grad school on hold to support them, but now her parents are offering to cover her tuition, and she wants to go back for a different career.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is the husband's internal feelings about being the breadwinner and his fear of feeling emasculated if his wife makes more. He's honest about that. But society often has certain expectations about gender roles and income, though I know many people don't share that view. The wife is making a choice about her own career, which is her right. The husband's argument is that they don't need the extra money, and he's worried about his self-worth in the relationship. \n\nWait, the wife's parents are funding the education, so it's not like she's burdening the couple's finances. The husband's concern isn't about the financial stability of the relationship but about his own ego. That seems problematic. People should support each other's ambitions regardless of income. Also, the user mentions that their current setup is comfortable, but the wife wants to pursue her dream. Shouldn't personal fulfillment be a priority?\n\nBut then, the husband's reasoning is based on his own feelings of emasculation. That's a common issue some people face, but does that make him in the wrong? If he's being honest and they can communicate about it, maybe there's a way to work through it. However, the question is whether he is at fault. The wife is making a choice that's her own, and the husband is not supporting her dream because of his own insecurities. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife contributed by working full-time when he was in his master's. Now, she's considering her path. The husband's opposition might be seen as selfish or not respecting her goals. Even if her salary is higher, they can still share the financial responsibilities. The fact that they don't plan on having kids might actually make this easier. \n\nSo, the husband's feelings are valid, but his justification for opposing his wife's career choice is based on his ego rather than practical concerns. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's growth is key. Therefore, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
