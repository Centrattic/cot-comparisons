I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the main question is whether it's okay for the husband to be upset that his wife might make more money than him.\n\nFirst, the husband mentions that he's the main breadwinner, and they live comfortably on his salary alone. The wife is currently working but making less than half of his salary. Now, she's considering going to grad school with her parents' help, which would lead to a higher salary than his. The husband feels emasculated at the thought of making less than her. \n\nHmm, the key points here are his feelings about being the breadwinner and his self-esteem being tied to that role. He also says they don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial need to increase income. The wife gave up her grad school plans before to support him through his master's, which suggests she's already made sacrifices for their relationship. Now she wants to pursue her own dream, which he's discouraging because of his ego.\n\nI think the problem here is that his feelings about his role as the breadwinner are influencing her decision. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important. If her going to grad school is her passion and it's feasible financially (since they don't need more money), he should support her. His issue seems to stem from his self-worth being tied to his income compared to her, which isn't fair. He's prioritizing his feelings over her aspirations. \n\nAdditionally, the wife already made a sacrifice by putting her education on hold before. Now she's excited about this opportunity. The husband's hesitation is based on his own insecurities rather than practical reasons. That makes him the one in the wrong because he's not respecting her choice and her growth. So the answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
