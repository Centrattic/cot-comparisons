I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the provided scenario is in the wrong. The story is about a husband who's uncomfortable with his wife pursuing a graduate degree that would lead to a higher salary than his. The key points here are his reasons for opposing her decision.\n\nFirst, the husband's main argument is that he's not against her career growth but is worried about being the breadwinner and feeling \"emasculated\" if he makes less. However, the underlying issue here is his prioritization of financial dynamics over his wife's personal aspirations. \n\nThe wife is offered a unique opportunity from her parents to go back to school, which could be a significant step towards her dream. She's already made sacrifices before, like putting her grad school plans on hold to support them financially. Now, she has the chance to pursue her interests without financial burden, which seems like a positive move. \n\nThe husband's objection is based on his own insecurities rather than practical reasons. The fact that they don't plan on having kids and already live comfortably on his salary removes the necessity for dual incomes. His feelings about his self-worth being tied to his earnings compared to his wife's is a personal issue, but it's affecting her opportunities. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is crucial. The husband's reluctance could be seen as selfish if it's preventing her from fulfilling her potential. Even if he's not the one making the money, their combined resources would still be sufficient. The wife's happiness and career growth should take precedence, especially when the opportunity is available without financial strain.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his personal insecurities are hindering his wife's aspirations without valid reasons.\n"
