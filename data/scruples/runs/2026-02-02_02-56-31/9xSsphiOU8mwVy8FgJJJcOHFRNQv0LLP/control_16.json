I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him, even though they can live comfortably on his income alone.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband's main argument is that he likes being the primary breadwinner, and he feels emasculated if he makes less than his wife. His wife had given up grad school plans in the past to work and support them, but now her parents are offering to pay for her education again. She's interested in a different career path that would earn her more, and he's against it, not because of financial necessity but because of his own feelings about being the main earner.\n\nThe user wants to know if the husband is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider social norms and values. Traditionally, there might have been a norm where the man is expected to be the higher earner, but in modern times, this is changing. Many people argue that both partners should pursue their own careers and interests regardless of income comparison. The husband's reasoning is based on personal insecurities rather than practical concerns like financial stability, which is already provided by his salary. \n\nAlso, the wife's autonomy is important. She has the right to pursue her education and career goals, especially since her parents are covering the costs. The husband's opposition seems to stem from his own ego rather than any valid reason. The fact that they don't plan to have kids removes the argument about needing dual incomes. \n\nAnother point is that the wife had previously put her grad school plans on hold to support the relationship, but now she's interested again. The husband's resistance could be seen as undermining her personal aspirations. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's growth is crucial. His hesitation might hinder her personal development and could lead to resentment.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the husband's feelings are valid because he's being honest about his insecurities. But society is moving towards valuing equality and mutual support over traditional gender roles. The husband's stance could be seen as outdated and selfish, prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's ambitions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband is in the wrong because his opposition is based on personal ego rather than practical reasons, and it disregards his wife's right to pursue her career and education. The correct answer should be A.\n"
