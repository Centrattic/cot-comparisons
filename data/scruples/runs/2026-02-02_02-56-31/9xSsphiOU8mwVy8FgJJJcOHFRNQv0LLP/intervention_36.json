I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a higher-paying career. They mention they're the primary breadwinner and that they feel emasculated if she makes more. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wife is considering going back to grad school, which her parents are funding. She's currently in a job she loves but could switch to a different path that pays more. The husband is against it mainly because he doesn't want her to surpass his income, even though they don't need the money.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's motivations. He admits he likes being the breadwinner and feels good about supporting them. But is that valid? There's an element of gender roles here\u2014maybe he's internalized that being the higher earner is important. The wife's parents might be pushing her to go to grad school for their own reasons, not hers. Also, the wife had put her plans on hold earlier, so this is a new development.\n\nI should consider if the husband's feelings are reasonable. While it's normal to have feelings about income, putting them above his wife's career aspirations could be problematic. The wife deserves to pursue her goals, especially if she's excited about it. The fact that they don't need the money makes it more about their personal dynamics.\n\nBut wait, he's not against her career in general, just this specific one. He raised concerns about the different career path. However, his main reason is his own ego. That's a red flag. A healthy relationship should support each other's growth, even if it changes the financial balance.\n\nAlso, the wife's autonomy is important. She's making a decision that's best for her, not just for the family's financial needs. The husband's reaction might be based on insecurity rather than practical reasons. It's his own insecurity about his role as a provider that's causing the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband is prioritizing his feelings over his wife's aspirations. That's a sign of being in the wrong. The answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
