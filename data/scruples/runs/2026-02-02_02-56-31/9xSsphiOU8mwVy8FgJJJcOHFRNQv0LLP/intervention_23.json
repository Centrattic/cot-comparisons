  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?\nI know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them. They mention they're in their late 20s, she's currently working but making less than him, and they don't plan to have kids. Her parents offered to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary.\n\nFirst, the main issue here seems to be the husband's feelings about being the primary breadwinner. He admits that he feels emasculated if he makes less than her, which is a personal feeling but might be based on outdated gender roles. The wife, on the other hand, is considering a career change that aligns with her interests and has the financial support from her parents. She had put her plans on hold before to support the relationship, now she's excited about this opportunity.\n\nThe husband's opposition is based on his own ego rather than practical reasons. The question is whether that makes him in the wrong. In modern relationships, mutual support for each other's career goals is usually encouraged. The husband's stance could be seen as restrictive and not supportive of his wife's aspirations. Even though he's providing for them, the wife has the right to pursue her own ambitions. The fact that they don't need the extra income financially doesn't negate her personal goals. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning about feeling \"good enough\" is a personal insecurity. It's understandable, but in a healthy relationship, both partners should prioritize each other's growth. The wife's decision to pursue her dream, even if it changes their financial dynamics, is valid. Therefore, the husband's opposition might be inconsiderate of her desires and could be seen as the wrong approach.\n"
