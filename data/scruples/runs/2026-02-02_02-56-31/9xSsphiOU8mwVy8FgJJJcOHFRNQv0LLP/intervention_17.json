I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault here. The situation is about not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them. They mention that they make enough for both of them, and she's considering grad school funded by her parents. The user feels emasculated at the thought of making less and are questioning their stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's reasoning is based on their own feelings of self-worth tied to being the breadwinner. That's a personal issue, but does that make them wrong? In modern relationships, it's common for both partners to pursue their own careers, and earning more isn't inherently a problem. However, the user's main concern isn't about practical reasons like financial necessity but about their own ego.\n\nThe wife previously put her education on hold to support the relationship financially. Now she's considering going back, even though she loves her current job. The user's opposition isn't about her happiness or the feasibility of the plan but about their own feelings of emasculation. That seems self-centered. Healthy relationships prioritize each other's growth and happiness. If the user is blocking her from pursuing her dream because of their own insecurities, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the user mentions they don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial pressure. Their main argument is about feeling good about being the sole provider, which isn't a valid reason to hinder their spouse's aspirations. The wife's parents are offering to cover the costs, so financial burden isn't an issue here either.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the user's stance is based on their own ego rather than the wife's best interests. It's important to support a partner's goals unless there are legitimate concerns (like financial strain or the feasibility of the new career). Since there's no such issue here, the user's opposition is rooted in insecurity rather than reason.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the user being in the wrong. They should reflect on why their self-worth is tied to their income compared to their spouse's and work on addressing those feelings instead of discouraging her growth.\n"
