I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The author is a man who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points in the scenario. The couple is in their late 20s, they don't plan to have kids, and they currently live comfortably on his salary. The wife had put her graduate studies on hold to work full-time and support the relationship. Now, with her parents offering to pay for her grad school, she's considering changing her career path, which could lead to a higher salary than the author's.\n\nThe author's main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife makes more. He admits that he values being the breadwinner. The wife, on the other hand, loves her current job but wants to pursue her dream, which is a different career path. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wife has the right to pursue her own career and education, especially since her parents are covering the costs. The author's primary objection seems to be based on his own ego rather than practical concerns like financial necessity or the wife's well-being. The couple isn't in a position where they need her income, so the financial argument doesn't hold. \n\nSocietal norms are shifting towards equality in relationships, and prioritizing one's own ambitions shouldn't be hindered by a partner's ego. The author's feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override his wife's aspirations. The question is whether his stance is in the wrong. Since the wife's decision is about her personal goals and the couple's financial situation is stable, it's reasonable to conclude that the author is in the wrong for not supporting his wife's choice based on his own insecurities. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
