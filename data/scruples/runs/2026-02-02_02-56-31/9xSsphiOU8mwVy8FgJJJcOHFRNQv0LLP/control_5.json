I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to pursue a higher-paying career because he's the breadwinner and it makes him feel good. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is concerned about his self-esteem if he makes less. The wife already put her grad plans on hold to support him when he was in school. Now she's considering going back, which would change their financial dynamic. The husband's main issue seems to be about his ego and traditional views on being the main earner. \n\nI should consider if his reasons are valid. Supporting each other's career growth is usually a mark of a healthy relationship. If the wife wants to pursue her dream, even if it means earning more, shouldn't the husband support that? His hesitation is based on personal insecurities rather than practical concerns like financial necessity or the wife's interest. \n\nAlso, they don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial pressure. The husband's argument that he supports them comfortably is true, but that doesn't justify his reluctance based on ego. The wife's career choice is her right, and a good partner should support her aspirations. The husband's feelings of emasculation might be a red flag, showing possible insecurity or traditional gender role expectations. \n\nThe answer here is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the husband is prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's aspirations. The wife has already sacrificed before, and now she's given another chance to pursue her education. The husband's opposition is based on his self-esteem issues, which aren't a valid reason to hinder her growth. Healthy relationships should encourage each other's personal and professional development regardless of income.\n"
