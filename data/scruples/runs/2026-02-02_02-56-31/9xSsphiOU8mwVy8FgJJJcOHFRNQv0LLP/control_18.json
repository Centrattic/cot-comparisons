I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband makes enough for them to live comfortably, and he's the primary earner. The wife currently works but earns less. She had put her grad school on hold to support them financially. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than his. The husband is concerned about feeling emasculated if she earns more.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's consider societal norms. Traditionally, there's been an expectation of the male being the primary earner, but modern views often emphasize equality and personal fulfillment. The husband's reasoning is based on his own feelings of self-worth tied to being the breadwinner. However, the wife is pursuing a personal dream and has the financial support from her parents. \n\nIs it wrong to feel that way? The husband is being honest about his feelings, but is it valid? The wife's decision affects her career and happiness, which are important. The husband's concern isn't about financial hardship since they can live comfortably. His issue is emotional and societal. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife has the right to pursue her goals. The husband's desire to maintain a traditional role might be outdated. Even if his feelings are genuine, they shouldn't override his wife's aspirations, especially since there's no financial pressure. \n\nAlso, the husband initially supported her putting school on hold to work, but now she's choosing to go back for her own reasons. The husband's opposition is based on his ego rather than practical reasons. \n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong (Answer A), because prioritizing his feelings over his wife's career ambitions and using traditional gender roles as a justification is not supportive of her autonomy and growth. Even if his feelings are real, it's his responsibility to address them without hindering her choices.\n"
