      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The scenario says that when the parent arrived to pick up their daughter, the daughter's friend was also there and wanted a ride home. The parent declined, then went home with their daughter. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents are typically responsible for their own child, and unless they've agreed to take others, they aren't obligated to provide rides. The daughter's friend might be relying on the parent to take her, but unless there was prior agreement or a situation where the friend is in danger (like being stranded late at night), the parent isn't necessarily at fault.\n\nThe time was 6 PM, which isn't too late, but depends on the context. If the friend had no other way home and was left without help, maybe that's a problem. But the parent's main duty is to their own child. The daughter might have known about the friend needing a ride and not mentioned it, or maybe she didn't. The parent didn't ask if the friend needed a ride, but they might not be responsible unless there's a prior understanding.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people might expect a ride if they're with your child, but legally and ethically, the parent isn't obligated. Unless there's a safety concern, leaving the friend there isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
