      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that they went to pick up their daughter around 6 PM, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home. The parent declined and only took their daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. As a parent, their primary duty is to their own child. The daughter's friend isn't their responsibility unless there's some prior agreement or legal obligation. The parent didn't have any obligation to take the friend home. The friend might have expected it because maybe it was common or implied, but the parent isn't required to provide transportation for someone else's child unless they've agreed to do so.\n\nAnother angle is the time of day. It was 6 PM, which might be considered reasonable for a kid to be at the park. However, leaving a child unattended could be a concern. But the parent didn't leave the friend unattended; they just didn't offer a ride. The friend might have had other means to get home, like another parent or a public transport option. The parent isn't responsible for ensuring the friend gets home safely unless they've taken on that role.\n\nAlso, considering the parent's intent, they went to pick up their daughter, not the friend. The friend's request came unexpectedly. The parent made a choice based on their own family's needs. There's no indication of negligence here unless they knew the friend couldn't get home otherwise. Since the question doesn't mention any prior arrangement or the friend's inability to get home, the parent's decision seems within their rights.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent isn't in the wrong because they aren't responsible for the friend's transportation unless they agreed to. They acted in their own family's interest, which is their primary duty. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
