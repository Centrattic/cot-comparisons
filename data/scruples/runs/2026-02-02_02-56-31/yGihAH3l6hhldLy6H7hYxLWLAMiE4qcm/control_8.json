      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend wanted a ride home but was declined. The parent then drove their daughter home, and it was around six o'clock when they picked her up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. The parent went to get their daughter, so their primary responsibility is to the daughter. The friend is the daughter's friend, so the parent isn't legally obligated to give them a ride. The parent might have considered their own schedule or the daughter's needs first, which makes sense. However, maybe the daughter expected her friend to be picked up too, and the parent didn't check with the daughter about that. But the parent didn't have prior knowledge that the friend needed a ride. It's possible that the friend just asked at the last minute. \n\nAlso, the time was around six. If the friend needed to be picked up at a specific time, maybe the parent was aware of that. But the narrative doesn't mention that. The parent might have thought it was their responsibility only to their daughter. The friend's parent might be upset if the child was left waiting, but the parent isn't necessarily responsible unless they agreed beforehand. \n\nSo, the parent might not be in the wrong because they were fulfilling their duty to their daughter. Unless there was an agreement or expectation that the parent would also pick up the friend, which isn't indicated here. Therefore, the answer would be B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
