      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they were wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. So the situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and when they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride home. The parent declined, then took their daughter home. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider why the parent might be in the wrong. Maybe the friend expected a ride, or there was an unspoken agreement. But on the other hand, the parent's primary responsibility is their own child. They might not have a duty to give someone else a ride unless they had prior arrangements. \n\nBut wait, was there any prior understanding? The question doesn't mention that. The parent didn't know the friend needed a ride before arriving. So maybe the parent isn't obligated here. However, sometimes people might expect that if you're picking up their kid, you might also help a friend. But that's an assumption. \n\nAlso, the time was 6 PM. Depending on the location, it might be getting dark, so leaving a child alone at the park could be an issue. But the question doesn't say the friend was left alone. Maybe she had another way home, or maybe the parent didn't consider that. \n\nSo, the parent might be in the wrong if the friend was relying on them to take her home, but if there's no prior agreement, maybe not. But the problem is that the friend was left there unexpectedly. The parent didn't have to take her, but maybe they should have considered that the friend might be in a situation where she needed help. \n\nAlternatively, the parent's responsibility is to their own child. They might not have a legal or moral obligation to the friend. But the AITA (Am I the Asshole) angle often considers social norms. If the parent was in a position to help and just left the friend, some might say they're being selfish. \n\nBut the answer depends on whether the parent had any reason to know the friend needed a ride. If the daughter mentioned it, maybe they should have arranged it beforehand. If not, the parent might not be at fault. The question doesn't mention the daughter's role in this. Did the daughter know her friend needed a ride? If she didn't inform her parent, then the parent might not be responsible. \n\nSo, the key points are: prior knowledge, responsibility to others, and whether the parent acted reasonably. Without prior knowledge, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the friend was left stranded, it might be seen as inconsiderate. But legally or morally, unless there's an obligation, the parent isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards B, No, the parent isn't in the wrong. They were fulfilling their duty to their child. But some might argue they should have offered another option. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just unkind. So probably B.\n"
