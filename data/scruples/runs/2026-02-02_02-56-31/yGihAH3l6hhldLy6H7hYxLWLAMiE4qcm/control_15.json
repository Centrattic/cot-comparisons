      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to the park to pick up their daughter, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home, but the parent declined. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, which they did. The friend of the daughter was present but wasn't the parent's responsibility. Unless there's a prior agreement or legal obligation to take the friend, the parent isn't obligated to do so. \n\nHowever, maybe the daughter expected her friend to be picked up? If the friend was a minor, the parent might be expected to help, but the question doesn't specify if the friend is a child or an adult. Assuming the friend is a minor, the parent might be expected to take them, but the parent might not know if they're allowed to take a stranger's child. Plus, the parent might have had a reason to not want to take someone else's kid, like not knowing the parents or having a policy. \n\nAlso, the time was 6 PM. If the friend's parents were expecting them home at that time and the parent was responsible, then not picking them up could be an issue. But without more info, like the friend being stranded or the parent being the designated ride, it's hard to say. The parent might have no prior arrangement to take the friend. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, unless there's a clear expectation or agreement, the parent isn't in the wrong. The friend should have made arrangements with their own parents or communicated better. The parent's responsibility is their own child, so declining the friend's request isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
