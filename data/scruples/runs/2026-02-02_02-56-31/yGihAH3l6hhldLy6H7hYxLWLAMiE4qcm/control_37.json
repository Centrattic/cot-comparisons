      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend wanted a ride home too, but the parent declined. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, which they did. The friend wanted a ride, but the parent wasn't obligated to provide that. There's no mention of prior arrangements or agreements where the parent agreed to take the friend home. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the parent could have offered to drop off the friend on the way, but maybe the parent didn't want to inconvenience themselves further after work. Others might think the friend could have asked earlier or arranged their own transportation. It's possible that the friend was left waiting, but without more information, it's hard to say if the parent was at fault. \n\nBut the key point is that the parent wasn't responsible for the friend. Their duty was to their daughter. Unless there's a cultural expectation or specific prior understanding, the parent isn't in the wrong here. So the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
