      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The scenario is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride home. The parent declined and only took their daughter home.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The parent's main responsibility is their own child. So if the daughter needed to be picked up, the parent's primary duty is to her. The friend of the daughter might have been relying on the parent to take her home, but the parent didn't have an obligation to do so unless they had previously agreed to. \n\nWait, the parent didn't mention any prior agreement. So if the friend just showed up and asked, the parent isn't necessarily responsible. Also, the time was around 6 PM, which might be after school hours. Parents might have specific arrangements for their children, but unless they've agreed to take others, they don't have to. \n\nBut maybe the parent should have offered to take the friend if they were going in the same direction? Or maybe the friend expected the parent to take her because the parent picks up the daughter regularly. However, the parent isn't the friend's parent, so they aren't obligated. The friend's parents should be responsible for her transportation. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend was left in an unsafe situation, that could be a problem. Was the park a safe place? The parent might have thought it was okay for the friend to stay there until her own ride arrived. But if the friend was stranded, maybe the parent should have helped. However, without prior arrangement, the parent isn't in the wrong for not taking her. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parent isn't responsible for the friend's transportation unless they had an agreement. They fulfilled their duty to their own daughter.\n"
