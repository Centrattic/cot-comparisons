      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the parent went to the park to pick up their daughter after work. When they arrived, there was the daughter's friend there who wanted a ride home. The parent declined to give her a ride and only took their daughter home. The question is whether the author (the parent) is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was picking up their own daughter, which is their responsibility. The friend of the daughter asked for a ride home. The parent had no prior arrangement to pick up the friend. The key factors here might be: Did the parent have any obligation to take the friend? Was the friend expecting a ride? Was there any agreement between the parent and the friend?\n\nSince the parent's main responsibility is to their own child, it's reasonable that they would prioritize their daughter. Unless there was an explicit agreement or expectation that the parent would also take the friend, declining seems acceptable. However, maybe the daughter had arranged for her friend to be picked up, which could create an obligation. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The parent might not have known about any such arrangement. \n\nAnother angle: The parent might not feel responsible for the friend's transportation unless there was prior communication. Without that, it's within the parent's rights to decline. The time of day (around 6 PM) might not be relevant unless it's considered late for the friend, but that's speculative. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The friend might have been left stranded, but the parent's main duty is to their child. The parent can't be expected to take on additional responsibilities unless agreed upon. On the other hand, maybe the daughter should have informed the parent about the friend needing a ride, but again, the parent isn't necessarily at fault for not knowing. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for parents to have the final say in their own child's activities and responsibilities. Unless there was an expectation set by the parent beforehand, declining a ride for someone else's child seems okay. The parent can't be held responsible for the friend's situation unless there was a prior agreement. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the parent isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
