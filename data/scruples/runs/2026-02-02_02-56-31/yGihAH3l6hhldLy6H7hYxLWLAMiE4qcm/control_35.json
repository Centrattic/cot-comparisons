      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park.\n\nSo, the situation is that the parent was going to pick up their daughter from the park. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and wanted a ride home. The parent declined, then went home with their daughter. Time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. The parent was picking up their own daughter, so their primary duty is to their child. The daughter's friend isn't their responsibility unless there's an agreement otherwise. The parent might not have a legal or moral obligation to give the friend a ride unless they had prior arrangements.\n\nBut maybe the daughter expected the parent to help the friend? If the daughter asked the parent to take the friend, then the parent might be expected to comply. However, the parent didn't agree, so that's their choice. \n\nAlso, the time is 6 PM, which might be when schools or parents expect kids to be picked up. If the friend was left without a ride, maybe the parent should have checked if the daughter knew her friend needed a ride. But the parent's main duty is to their own child, so they might not be at fault here.\n\nAnother angle: Did the parent have the right to refuse? Since it's their own time and they were there for their daughter, refusing isn't necessarily wrong. However, maybe the daughter's friend was left stranded, but that's the parent's choice unless there's an agreement to help.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent isn't in the wrong because they weren't obligated to give the friend a ride. They were there for their daughter, and declining isn't unreasonable unless there was prior agreement. So answer B (No).\n"
