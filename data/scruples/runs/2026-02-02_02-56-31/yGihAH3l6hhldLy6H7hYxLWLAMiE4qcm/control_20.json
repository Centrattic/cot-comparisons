      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park around 6 PM, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home. The parent declined and only took their daughter home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is their daughter. They were coming home from work, and their main duty is to their child. The daughter's friend was present, but there's no indication that the parent had any prior obligation to take her. \n\nNow, the friend needed a ride home. But did the parent promise to help? The scenario doesn't mention any prior agreement. As a parent, they might not feel comfortable picking up someone else's child or a friend without knowing the situation. Also, safety is a concern. The parent might not know the friend's family or the best way to contact them.\n\nAnother angle: the time was 6 PM. If the friend was expecting a ride, maybe they should have arranged it earlier. Maybe the friend should have planned better or informed the parent in advance if they needed a ride. Parents can't be expected to accommodate every last-minute request from others' kids, especially without prior arrangement.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's considerate to help, but the parent isn't obligated. The friend's needs don't override the parent's responsibility to their own child. The parent's decision was to prioritize their daughter, which makes sense. There's no evidence that the parent acted out of malice or neglect. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the parent isn't in the wrong. They were doing their duty by their daughter, and the friend should have made arrangements for transportation. The answer is B.\n"
