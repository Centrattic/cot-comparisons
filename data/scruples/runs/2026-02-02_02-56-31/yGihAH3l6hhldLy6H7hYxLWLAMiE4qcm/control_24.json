      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. So, the situation is that the parent picked up their daughter from the park and declined to give a ride to the daughter's friend. The time was around 6 PM, and the parent just drove their daughter home.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the context. The parent's main responsibility is their own daughter. They were called to pick up the daughter, so that's their direct responsibility. The friend was there too, but the parent wasn't obligated to take her. Now, is it wrong to not offer a ride?\n\nWell, the parent might have had their own reasons. Maybe they didn't know the friend well, or they felt it was the friend's responsibility to get home. Alternatively, maybe they thought the friend had other means. But the key point here is that the parent wasn't responsible for the friend. The parent's duty is to their own child. Unless there's a prior agreement or the friend was under their care, the parent isn't in the wrong for not providing a ride. The friend should have arranged her own transportation. So the answer is probably B, no, the author isn't in the wrong."
