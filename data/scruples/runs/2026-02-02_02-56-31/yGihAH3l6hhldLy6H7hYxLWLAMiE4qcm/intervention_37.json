      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend was there and wanted a ride home. The parent declined. The key details are that the friend wasn't their responsibility unless there was an agreement otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if there's any expectation that the parent should give rides to the daughter's friends. If the parent hadn't previously agreed to do so, then maybe it's not their responsibility. Parents aren't obligated to help other people's kids unless they've made a commitment. Also, the parent was picking up their own daughter, so their primary responsibility is to her.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a social expectation, especially if the friend had a habit of being picked up. But the scenario doesn't mention any prior arrangements. The parent might have felt it's not their obligation. On the flip side, if the friend was left stranded, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But without prior agreement, the parent isn't necessarily wrong for declining. So the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
