      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The context is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend wanted a ride home. The parent declined her, and it was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. The main duty here is to their own daughter. The friend was at the park, maybe with the daughter, but the parent isn't obligated to give rides to others unless they've agreed beforehand. The parent might not even know the friend well enough to assume that responsibility.\n\nTime of day is a factor. 6 PM is getting dark in many places, so leaving the friend there could be a safety concern. However, the friend might have other ways to get home, like walking if it's nearby or using another method. The parent might not know the friend's situation, so they can't be blamed for not offering a ride unless there was an expectation.\n\nAlso, the parent's primary responsibility is to their daughter. They were there to pick up their child, which was the main purpose. The daughter might not be comfortable with the parent giving rides to her friend, especially if the parent is meeting the friend for the first time. There's a potential safety issue for the daughter if the parent picks up the friend without her consent or knowledge.\n\nAnother angle: did the daughter know her friend needed a ride? If the daughter asked the parent to take the friend, that might be different. But the parent declined, so maybe the daughter didn't ask. The parent might not want to get into a situation where they have to transport someone they don't know well, especially without prior arrangement.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes parents are expected to help others in need, but it's not a strict obligation. The parent might feel it's overstepping their duty. The key points are safety, prior agreements, and the parent's primary responsibility to their child. Since the parent didn't explicitly agree to give the friend a ride, and they were there for their daughter, the answer leans towards the parent not being in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
