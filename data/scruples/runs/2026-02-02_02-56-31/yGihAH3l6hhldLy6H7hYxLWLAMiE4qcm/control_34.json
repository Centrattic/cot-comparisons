      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park around 6 PM, and the daughter's friend was there needing a ride home. The parent declined to give the friend a ride.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was picking up their own daughter, and the friend was not their child. The parent might have obligations or reasons not to take someone else's child home. But was declining the ride the wrong thing to do?\n\nThe key points here: The parent is not the friend's parent. They might not have a duty to take the friend home. However, there could be social expectations. Maybe the daughter's friend was left stranded, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But on the other hand, the parent isn't responsible for the friend and might have had other commitments or reasons not to offer a ride.\n\nI should also think about the time. It was around 6 PM, which might be when the friend's parents expect her to be home. If the parent left the friend there, maybe the friend had to find another way home, which could be a problem if she wasn't able to. But unless there was a prior agreement or expectation that the parent would take the friend, it's not necessarily their fault.\n\nAnother angle: The parent's responsibility is to their own child. They might not be in the wrong for not extending that responsibility to another child unless there's a specific reason to do so. However, if the friend was left without any means to get home, maybe the parent should have offered some help, like calling the friend's parents or suggesting alternatives.\n\nBut the question is whether the parent is in the wrong for declining. If the parent wasn't obligated to take the friend, then declining might be acceptable. But if there's a cultural or social expectation in their community that parents help each other's kids, then maybe it's seen as wrong.\n\nLooking at similar AITA scenarios, sometimes people are criticized for not helping in such situations, but others argue that it's not their responsibility. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances not mentioned here, like whether the friend had other options or if the parent knew the friend had no other rides. Since the parent doesn't mention prior commitments or any reason why they couldn't give a ride, the default assumption might be that they just chose not to help, which could be seen as inconsiderate, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, unless there was an expectation that the parent would take the friend home, they might not be in the wrong. But if the friend was left in a difficult situation with no alternative, it could be seen as inconsiderate. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively. The parent isn't the friend's guardian, so their primary duty is to their own child. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
