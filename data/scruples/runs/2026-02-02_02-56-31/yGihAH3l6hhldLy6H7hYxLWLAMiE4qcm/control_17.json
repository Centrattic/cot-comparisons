      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and there was the daughter's friend there who wanted a ride home. The parent declined to help and only took their daughter. It was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was picking up their own daughter, so their primary responsibility is to their child. The friend might have been expected to know that the parent is only there for the daughter. But maybe the friend thought that since the parent came to the park, they could take both kids. However, the parent might not be responsible for the friend unless there's an arrangement beforehand.\n\nAnother angle: Is there any expectation that the parent should help others? If the friend was left intentionally, maybe it's the parent's right to prioritize their own child. But if the parent knew the friend needed a ride and could have taken her, maybe they should have. However, the parent might not have an obligation unless it's a recurring situation or an agreement. \n\nAlso, the time was 6 PM. If the friend's parents are expecting them home at a certain time, leaving her might be an issue. But the parent might not know that. The key points are intent and prior expectations. If the parent was only there for their daughter and didn't promise to take the friend, then they're not in the wrong. If the friend was relying on that ride, maybe the parent should have checked. But without prior arrangement, maybe not. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No), the parent isn't in the wrong because they were fulfilling their duty to their daughter and didn't have an obligation to the friend unless there was a prior agreement.\n"
