      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, but the daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride home. The parent declined and only took their daughter. The friend was left at the park around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parent did something wrong. The key points here are consent and responsibility. The parent's main responsibility is to their own daughter. They were going to the park specifically to pick her up. The friend, being another person, isn't under the parent's care unless there was prior agreement. \n\nThe parent didn't agree to give the friend a ride. The friend might have expected it, but unless the parent had a prior commitment or it was a common practice, they aren't obligated. Also, the parent might not be familiar with the friend's situation\u2014maybe they don't know where the friend lives or if it's safe to drop them off. \n\nHowever, leaving someone at a park in the evening could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the friend was relying on the ride. But the parent's primary duty is to their child. Unless there's more context like the friend being a minor without supervision or the parent being aware of a dangerous situation, the parent isn't necessarily at fault. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the parent had any prior agreement to help the friend. If not, they're not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
