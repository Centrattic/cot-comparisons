      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter, and the daughter's friend was there and wanted a ride home. The parent declined, then went home with their daughter. It was around 6 PM when they picked up the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parents aren't necessarily responsible for their kids' friends unless they've agreed to. The parent was only there to pick up their own daughter. The daughter's friend might have assumed they'd get a ride, but the parent didn't have an obligation. Also, timing is a factor\u20146 PM could be when school gets out, so maybe the friend had other plans. \n\nBut wait, maybe the friend was relying on the parent to take her home. If the parent didn't know beforehand that the friend needed a ride, it's not their fault. The parent's main responsibility is their own child. Unless there was prior agreement to take the friend, the parent isn't at fault. The answer should be B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
