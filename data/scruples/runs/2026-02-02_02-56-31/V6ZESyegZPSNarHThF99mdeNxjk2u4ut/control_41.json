I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend accessed their private stuff. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend suggested sharing passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her their password, saying there's nothing to hide. But after that, the girlfriend went through his browser history, old conversations, and even his messages. This made him uncomfortable, so he changed his passwords. Now she's upset, saying that's untrustworthy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a trust-building gesture, and he initially complied. By giving her the password, he set an expectation that she would respect his privacy once given access. However, she went through his private data without his consent, which is a breach of trust from her side. The author's response was to revoke access by changing passwords, which he did to protect his privacy. That seems reasonable because even in a relationship, people have the right to their own privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the initial agreement to share passwords was a mutual trust gesture. By changing the passwords, the author could be seen as violating that trust, especially if he's not willing to allow her similar access. But the key point here is that the author changed the passwords to prevent further unauthorized access after she already invaded his privacy. So it's a self-protective measure rather than a breach.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is about maintaining personal boundaries. Even though he gave her the password initially, he's allowed to change it if he feels his privacy is being invaded. The fact that she's looking through his old messages and stuff without his consent is the real issue here. The author is not hiding anything new; he's protecting old, irrelevant data that's causing embarrassment.\n\nI think the main issue is the girlfriend's actions in accessing private information without permission. The author is responding to that by setting boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reclaiming his privacy through changing passwords. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
