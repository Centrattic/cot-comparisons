I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend and boyfriend living together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust, but the guy gave her his password. However, she ended up going through his stuff, finding old stuff like browser history, old messages, and even looked at his phone. He's now changing his passwords again to keep his privacy.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he's wrong for doing that. On one side, the girlfriend feels that since they should trust each other, she should have access. On the other hand, the guy is trying to maintain some privacy, especially after she invaded his personal space. \n\nI think the key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. Trust is important in a relationship, but that doesn't mean you have to give up all privacy. The girl's actions of going through his stuff without his consent are problematic. She said she found stuff, but he's not hiding anything; he's just uncomfortable with her invading his privacy. \n\nThe guy's response is to set boundaries by changing passwords. That seems reasonable. He's not hiding anything bad but wants to keep some personal space. The girlfriend's reaction is to accuse him of not trusting her, but the real issue is her overstepping boundaries. \n\nSo, the guy isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy. The problem lies with the girlfriend's behavior, not his decision to protect his devices. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
