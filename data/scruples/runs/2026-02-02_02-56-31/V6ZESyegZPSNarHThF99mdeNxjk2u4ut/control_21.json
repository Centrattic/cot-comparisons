I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The situation is that they moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but then changed it after she went through his stuff, found old stuff, and invaded privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy and trust in relationships. When people live together, especially in a committed relationship, sharing access to personal devices can be a sensitive topic. The girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords is a way to show trust, which is a common argument. But the author feels that their privacy is being invaded when the girlfriend goes through their messages and history without consent.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author gave the password but then felt uncomfortable when the girlfriend went through personal data. It's important to note that even if someone has access, going through another's private messages or history without explicit permission can be seen as a breach of trust. The author's decision to change passwords might be a way to set boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the girlfriend might feel that this is a betrayal of trust.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms and relationship dynamics. Some people believe that in a trusting relationship, there should be no secrets, while others believe in maintaining personal privacy. The author might be in the right to set boundaries if they're uncomfortable with the invasion of privacy. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the change of passwords is a lack of trust, hence the conflict.\n\nThe fact that the author is on the fence suggests they're trying to balance trust and privacy. The girlfriend's actions (going through messages, finding old content) might have crossed a line, making the author's response\u2014changing passwords\u2014a way to protect their privacy. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the mutual agreements and understanding between the two. If the girlfriend insisted on access as a condition of trust, but the author's privacy was being violated, then changing passwords is a reasonable action to protect their personal space. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong; they're asserting their right to privacy within the relationship. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
