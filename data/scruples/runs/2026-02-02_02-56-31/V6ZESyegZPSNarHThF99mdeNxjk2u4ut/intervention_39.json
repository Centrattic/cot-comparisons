  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about changing passwords to maintain privacy in a relationship. The user didn't want to share passwords but eventually gave their girlfriend access, probably to show trust. Now the girlfriend is going through his stuff and found old stuff that's embarrassing, even if it's not harmful. The user wants privacy, so they're changing passwords again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords can be a way to show trust. If both partners agree to share, not following through might seem like breaking that trust. But on the other hand, everyone has a right to privacy. Even in a relationship, people might not want certain personal information accessible to their partner. The user gave the password but now feels uncomfortable because the girlfriend is going through his data without permission.\n\nThe key points here are mutual consent and boundaries. The user initially shared the password, but the girlfriend is overstepping by looking through private messages and past data. The user is reclaiming their privacy by changing passwords, which is about setting boundaries. Trust is important, but trust shouldn't mean giving up all privacy. If the girlfriend feels entitled to access without permission, that's an issue. The user is trying to protect their personal space, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to adjust their privacy settings even after initially sharing. The problem might be more about the girlfriend respecting boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B, meaning the user is not in the wrong.\n"
