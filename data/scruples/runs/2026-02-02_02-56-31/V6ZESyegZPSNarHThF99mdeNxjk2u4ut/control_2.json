I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially agreed and gave her the password because they felt there was nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend then went through the author's private data\u2014browser history, old Skype messages, photos, and even looked through their phone. The author found this embarrassing and decided to change the passwords to reclaim some privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should mean keeping the access.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust, privacy, and mutual respect in a relationship. The author is concerned about privacy, which is a basic human need. Even if there's nothing illegal or harmful in the data, people often value their personal history and communications as private. The girlfriend's actions, though perhaps stemming from a desire for openness, crossed into the author's personal space without consent. The author's response is to set boundaries by changing passwords, which is a reasonable step to protect their privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that trust requires transparency. But trust in a relationship should not mean sacrificing all privacy. Healthy relationships involve both trust and respect for each other's boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they just want to keep certain aspects of their past private. The girlfriend's intrusion into the author's devices without clear consent is a breach of that privacy.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to protect their personal space. They've communicated their discomfort and set a boundary. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling hurt by the withdrawal of access, but the author's need for privacy is valid. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
