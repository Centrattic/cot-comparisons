I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords. The situation is about a girlfriend who wanted shared access to each other's devices, but the person changed their passwords after she went through their old stuff. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author initially agreed to share their password, thinking there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found some old, personal stuff and started going through messages. The author feels the need to protect their privacy, hence changing the passwords. \n\nNow, considering privacy rights even in relationships. People generally have the right to their privacy. The girlfriend might feel entitled to access because of the shared passwords, but the author has the right to set boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are mutual consent and trust. The girlfriend insisted on sharing passwords as a sign of trust, but the author is now adjusting to protect their personal space. It's important to note that trust doesn't necessarily mean giving up all privacy. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through old messages and other personal data\u2014could be seen as a breach of the author's privacy. The author's reaction is about reclaiming that privacy, which is reasonable. \n\nHowever, communication is crucial. The author should have discussed their concerns earlier instead of waiting until after the fact. But given the situation, changing passwords to prevent further intrusion seems justified. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting privacy after the other person overstepped. The answer would be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
