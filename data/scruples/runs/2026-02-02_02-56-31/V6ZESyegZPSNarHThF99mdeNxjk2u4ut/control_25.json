I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend and boyfriend moving in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust, but the guy gave her his password, then later changed it after she snooped through his stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy agreed to give his password initially because he thought there was nothing to hide. But when she started going through his private stuff, he felt the need to change the passwords to maintain privacy. The question is whether he did the right thing or if he's in the wrong by revoking access.\n\nFrom a privacy perspective, even in a relationship, people have the right to their own boundaries. The girlfriend might see shared passwords as a sign of trust, but the guy's actions were about protecting his personal space. The problem here is mutual understanding. The guy isn't hiding anything malicious, just old, irrelevant stuff that's causing embarrassment. His reaction is about maintaining personal privacy, which is reasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she feels trust is important. But trust should allow both parties to have some privacy. If one person needs to snoop to feel secure, that's a red flag. The guy changing passwords isn't a breach of trust; it's setting a boundary. So, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong (B). The issue might be more about communication, but the action itself is justified.\n"
