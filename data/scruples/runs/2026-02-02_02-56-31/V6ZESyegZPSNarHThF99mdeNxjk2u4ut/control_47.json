I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a show of trust. The author gave her the password even though he didn't want her password in return. Then the girlfriend started going through his stuff, like browser history, old messages, and even his phone. He found this embarrassing and decided to change passwords to reclaim privacy. She got upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about privacy vs. trust in a relationship. The author is trying to maintain some personal space, while the girlfriend sees shared access as a trust issue. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just uncomfortable with his past being pried into. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that shared access is a necessary part of the relationship. But, there's a difference between wanting to see each other's current activities and going through old, irrelevant data. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author didn't object to sharing passwords at first, but once the invasion of privacy happened, he decided to set boundaries. It's reasonable for him to want to protect his personal information, especially if the other person is overstepping. \n\nHowever, communication is crucial. The author should have discussed his concerns before changing passwords to avoid her feeling betrayed. But the act itself\u2014changing passwords to maintain privacy\u2014isn't inherently wrong. People have the right to privacy even in relationships. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy after experiencing unwanted intrusion. The problem lies in the lack of communication and the girlfriend's overstepping, not the author's decision to secure his devices.\n"
