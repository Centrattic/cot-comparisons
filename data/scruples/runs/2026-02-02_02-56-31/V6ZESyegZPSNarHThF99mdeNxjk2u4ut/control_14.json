I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their computer and phone. The main issue here is about privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked for shared passwords, and the person initially gave them, saying they have nothing to hide. Then the girlfriend went through old, private data like porn history, Skype messages with an ex, and other personal stuff. The person is now changing their passwords to reclaim some privacy, but the girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust means not needing passwords.\n\nHmm. So the person is trying to maintain their privacy, which is a valid concern. Everyone has a right to privacy, even in relationships. However, the girlfriend might feel that this action is a breach of trust. The problem is that the person gave their passwords initially, which the girlfriend took as permission to access their devices. When they rescind that access, it could be seen as being dishonest or breaking the trust they established.\n\nBut on the other hand, the person's right to privacy is important. They might feel uncomfortable with their personal past being scrutinized, even if it's irrelevant now. The girlfriend's actions of going through messages without consent could be considered an invasion of privacy. \n\nThe key points are: Did the initial agreement to share passwords create an expectation of openness? If so, changing passwords later might be seen as going back on that. But if the person feels their privacy is being violated even after sharing, they have a right to set boundaries. \n\nI think the person isn't in the wrong. They have the right to adjust their privacy settings, especially if they're uncomfortable with their partner accessing old data. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the person changing passwords to protect their privacy. So the answer should be B.\n"
