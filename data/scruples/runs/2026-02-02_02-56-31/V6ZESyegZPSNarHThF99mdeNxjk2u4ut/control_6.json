I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her their password because they had nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found old stuff like porn, old messages, and went through his messages. The author feels it's embarrassing and wants privacy, so they changed the passwords. The girlfriend is upset because she feels it's a trust issue.\n\nSo, the main question is about the right to privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're just uncomfortable with past content being pried into. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees shared passwords as a trust issue. \n\nIn relationships, privacy is important. Even if someone has nothing to hide, they might want personal space. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages without consent could be seen as a privacy violation. So, the author changing passwords could be a reasonable step to protect their privacy. \n\nBut some might argue that once you share passwords, you should accept the consequences. However, the author is setting boundaries now, which is their right. The key is mutual respect for boundaries. If the girlfriend respects the author's privacy, she shouldn't push for access. The author isn't hiding something bad, just maintaining personal privacy. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy after experiencing invasion of privacy from the girlfriend.\n"
