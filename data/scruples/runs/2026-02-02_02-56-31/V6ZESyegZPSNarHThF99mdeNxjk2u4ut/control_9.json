I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves moving in with a girlfriend who wanted shared passwords as a trust gesture. The guy initially gave her his password because he thought there was nothing to hide, but then she found old, personal stuff and started prying into his messages. He feels embarrassed and wants his privacy back, so he changes the passwords. She's upset because she thinks trust is important.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is about trust and transparency in the relationship. She might feel that sharing passwords is a way to show commitment. On the other hand, the guy feels that his privacy is being invaded when she goes through his old data and messages. He's justified in wanting some personal space, especially if these items are from the past and not relevant now. \n\nTrust is important in a relationship, but so is individual privacy. The key here is whether the guy overstepped by changing the passwords. He did agree to share initially, but after her actions made him uncomfortable. He's not hiding anything new; it's about past content he's now embarrassed about. \n\nLegally and ethically, people have the right to their own devices and privacy. Even in a relationship, unless there's a legal requirement (like for work or shared accounts), individuals can set boundaries. The girlfriend's behavior of going through his messages without consent might actually be the issue here. \n\nSo, the guy changing passwords to regain privacy isn't necessarily wrong. He's asserting his right to personal space after feeling violated. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any cultural or social norms I'm missing. In some contexts, sharing passwords is expected, but that's more about mutual respect rather than one-sided access. The main point is consent. She went through his stuff without his consent, so he's within his rights to limit access. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n"
