  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that they moved in together, and she wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. The user initially gave her the password, saying there's nothing to hide. But then she found old stuff like porn in browser history, old Skype messages with an ex, and looked through his phone messages. He's embarrassed and wants privacy, so he changed his passwords. She's upset, saying they should trust each other. The question is whether he did the right thing.\n\nHmm. First, the user's perspective: they value privacy and feel that their personal space is being invaded when the girlfriend goes through old stuff. Even if the content isn't relevant anymore, it's personal. The girlfriend's perspective is that trust means sharing access. \n\nTrust in a relationship is important, but privacy is also a personal boundary. The user gave her the password initially but now changed it because of the invasion of privacy. The girlfriend might feel betrayed by changing the password, thinking it's a lack of trust. But the user is setting a boundary to protect their privacy. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe discussing the boundaries together. But the user tried that and still felt invaded. So, the user's action is about maintaining personal privacy, which is valid. However, the conflict arises because the girlfriend views it as a breach of trust. \n\nLegally, I don't think there's an issue, but emotionally and relationally, it's tricky. The user isn't doing anything wrong by protecting their privacy. They're not hiding anything malicious; they just don't want their past to be pried into. So, answer B (not in the wrong). But maybe the user should communicate better to find a compromise. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best solution. Since he's setting boundaries, he's not in the wrong.\n"
