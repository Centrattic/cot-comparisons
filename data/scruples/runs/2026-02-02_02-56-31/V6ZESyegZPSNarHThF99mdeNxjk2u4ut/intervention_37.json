  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. They moved in together, and she wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. He gave her his password once, but she started going through his private stuff, which made him uncomfortable. Now he's changing the passwords again to have some privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the main question is about privacy vs. trust in a relationship. The user feels that his privacy is being invaded when she accesses his personal data without his consent. Even though he gave her the password initially, maybe he changed his mind because of the invasion of privacy. The key here is whether sharing passwords is a healthy practice and if it's reasonable to have boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but mutual respect for boundaries is also important. If the girlfriend is accessing his devices without consent, that's a problem. The user is trying to set boundaries by changing the passwords, which is a reasonable step to protect his privacy. Even though he shared the password once, he can change it if he feels it's necessary. The fact that she found old messages and such might be something he's not comfortable with being shared, even if they're from the past. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that sharing passwords is a sign of trust. But that's a flawed premise because trust shouldn't require access to someone's private data unless both parties are comfortable. The user is asserting his right to privacy, which is valid. The answer likely is B (he's not in the wrong) because he's protecting his personal space, and the girlfriend overstepped by accessing his devices without consent. The key issue here is unauthorized access, not the act of changing passwords to maintain privacy.\n"
