I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is in a relationship where they've given their girlfriend access to their devices by sharing passwords. The girlfriend has been going through his old data, which he finds embarrassing. Now he's changing his passwords again to regain some privacy, and she's upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user initially shared the password because he felt there was nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through old conversations, browsing history, etc.\u2014are invasive. Privacy is important even in relationships. The user's decision to change passwords is about setting boundaries, which is a common and healthy practice. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that sharing passwords is a sign of trust. But trust doesn't mean giving up all privacy. There's a difference between sharing relevant information and prying into past interactions. The user has the right to personal space, especially when it comes to old data that's not relevant now.\n\nThe key here is that the user isn't hiding something malicious; he's just uncomfortable with his past being pried into. Changing passwords to maintain privacy isn't wrong. The girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic, assuming that complete transparency is necessary. \n\nSo, the user is acting to protect his privacy, which is a reasonable response. Therefore, the answer should be B (I am not in the wrong).\n"
