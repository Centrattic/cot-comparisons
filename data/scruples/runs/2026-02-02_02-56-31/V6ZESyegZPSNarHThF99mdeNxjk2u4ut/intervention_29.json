  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend started going through their stuff. They gave her their passwords initially because they thought there was nothing to hide, but now she's finding old stuff and invading their privacy. The user wants to set boundaries, so they're changing passwords. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nFirst, the key points here are privacy versus trust. The girlfriend was given access willingly at first, but now she's using that access to look through past conversations and files, which makes the user uncomfortable. The user feels they need to protect their privacy, even though they don't have anything to hide. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but mutual respect for each other's privacy is also crucial. Just because someone shares their passwords doesn't mean they should expect the other person to have unrestricted access to potentially sensitive old data. The user has every right to feel that their privacy is being invaded if the other person starts sifting through personal messages or files without a legitimate reason. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that they should trust each other is valid, but trust shouldn't come at the expense of one person's comfort with their own privacy. The user is simply setting boundaries to protect their personal space, which is a reasonable and healthy approach. It's not about hiding something, but about maintaining a level of personal autonomy.\n\nSo, the answer here is likely B (Not in the wrong). The user is protecting their privacy after feeling that their trust was misused. They have the right to adjust their boundaries even after initial sharing, especially when it affects their emotional well-being.\n"
