  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple moving in together and sharing passwords. The guy gave his girlfriend his password, expecting mutual trust, but she ended up going through his private stuff, which made him uncomfortable. Now he wants to change his passwords to regain some privacy, but she's upset about it, saying they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man initially shared his password, which he thought was a gesture of trust. However, the girlfriend used that access to look into his past conversations, browser history, and phone data. This made him feel his privacy was invaded, even if there was nothing to hide. Now he's changing passwords again to protect his privacy, but she's upset about it.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, in a healthy relationship, both parties should have mutual trust and respect for each other's privacy. The girlfriend is crossing boundaries by going through his personal information, which is a problem. The man has the right to his privacy, even in a relationship. By changing his passwords, he's reclaiming his right to privacy, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's expectation that he should not do so because of trust is misplaced because trust doesn't mean giving up personal privacy without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing passwords might be a way to show trust. However, if that shared access is used to invade privacy, then that's an issue. The man's reaction is about protecting his own space, which is valid. The girlfriend's actions are the problem here, not the man's decision to set boundaries.\n\nSo, the man is not in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy after his boundaries were disrespected. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
