  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether they're in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they moved in together and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a show of trust. The user agreed to give her their password but now she's going through his history, old messages, and checking his phone. He finds this invasive and wants to set boundaries by changing passwords again.\n\nHmm, privacy is a big deal. Even in a relationship, people might expect some level of personal space. The girlfriend's actions are crossing into private areas the guy didn't want her to access. He mentioned it's embarrassing but not the content itself\u2014just that she's prying into old stuff. \n\nTrust is important, but mutual respect for each other's privacy is equally crucial. The fact that she's going through his messages without his consent, even if she thinks it's okay because of the shared password, is a breach of trust. He has the right to his own privacy and to set boundaries. Changing the password isn't about hiding things but about maintaining personal space. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). He's taking steps to protect his privacy, which is reasonable. The girlfriend should respect that. The key here is that the user isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just uncomfortable with her intrusion.\n"
