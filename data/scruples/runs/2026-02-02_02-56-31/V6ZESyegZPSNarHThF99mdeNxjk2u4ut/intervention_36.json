  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices is wrong. The key points here are trust, privacy, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a gesture of trust. The user agreed to give her their password, which shows initial willingness to be open. However, the user now feels their privacy is invaded because the girlfriend accessed personal, albeit old, information. The user changed the passwords to regain some control over their privacy.\n\nFrom a trust perspective, sharing passwords can be a two-way street. The user expected the same level of trust, but the girlfriend's actions (looking through messages, accessing old data) made the user uncomfortable. The user's decision to change passwords is about protecting their personal space, which is a common concern in relationships.\n\nBut here's the catch: mutual trust is essential in a relationship. If one partner feels the need to hide, it can create tension. The girlfriend might see password changes as a lack of trust, even if the user's intention is to maintain privacy. However, the user has a right to privacy, especially when it comes to personal devices and past interactions that are irrelevant now.\n\nThe user isn't in the wrong because they have a legitimate need for privacy. Relationships require balance between transparency and personal boundaries. The issue might be more about communication\u2014both sides need to discuss their expectations. The girlfriend's actions were intrusive, so the user's response is a reasonable step to protect their privacy. So, the answer is B.\n"
