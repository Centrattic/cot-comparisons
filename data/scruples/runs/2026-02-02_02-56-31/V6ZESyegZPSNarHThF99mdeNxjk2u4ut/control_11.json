I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that they moved in with their girlfriend and initially gave her their passwords to show trust. But then the girlfriend started going through his stuff, like browser history, old messages, and his phone. He's uncomfortable with the invasion of privacy, so he changed the passwords. Now she's upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about privacy versus trust. The author gave her the passwords, but then realized that his privacy was being invaded. He changed it back to regain some control over his personal data. The girlfriend feels that since they're in a relationship, there should be no secrets. But the author is justified in wanting privacy, right? Everyone has the right to some level of privacy, even in a relationship. \n\nBut wait, when he gave her the passwords, he might have set an expectation that she could access his devices. However, her going through his old messages and stuff without a good reason seems like a breach of his privacy. He didn't give her permission to snoop, even if she had the passwords. So changing the passwords to prevent that makes sense. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have set boundaries earlier. If he didn't want her to go through his stuff, he should have communicated that more clearly. But in the scenario, he mentions that he didn't care about her having the passwords because he felt he had nothing to hide. However, when she actually did go through his personal stuff, it made him uncomfortable. That's a valid reason to change the passwords. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I think not. He's trying to protect his privacy after realizing that sharing passwords led to unwanted intrusion. The girlfriend's argument that they should trust each other is valid, but trust shouldn't mean complete access to each other's personal history. There's a difference between sharing necessary information and prying into the past. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for changing the passwords to maintain his own privacy. The answer should be B.\n"
