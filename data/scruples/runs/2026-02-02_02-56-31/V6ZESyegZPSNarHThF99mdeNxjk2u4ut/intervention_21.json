  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The key points here are about privacy, trust, and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The person agreed to give her their password, but now the girlfriend has gone through their personal data. The user feels that their privacy is being invaded when the girlfriend accesses old messages, browser history, etc. They want to protect their personal space, which is understandable. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. However, that doesn't mean one person should have unrestricted access to the other's private information. Everyone has the right to some level of privacy. The girlfriend might think sharing passwords is a way to show trust, but the user isn't comfortable with the access it gives. \n\nThe user changed the passwords to reclaim their privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she sees this as breaking trust. The user's actions are about setting boundaries, which is healthy. The girlfriend's actions of searching through private data without permission can be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for protecting their privacy. They should address the issue by discussing the importance of mutual respect for boundaries. The girlfriend needs to understand that trust doesn't mean giving up all privacy. The answer here is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
