I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend and boyfriend moving in together and sharing passwords as a show of trust. The guy gave her his password but then changed it when he noticed she was going through his stuff, which made her upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy initially agreed to share his password, which he did. However, after that, he found out she was accessing his past data, which made him uncomfortable. He changed the passwords to regain his privacy. The main issue here is about trust and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nOn one hand, sharing passwords can be seen as a gesture of trust. If he agreed to it, maybe he's expected to keep it. But then, if she's invading his privacy by looking through his messages and old data, that's a problem. The key point is that even though he shared the password, it's his right to adjust his boundaries if he feels his privacy is being violated. \n\nIt's important to note that mutual respect and boundaries are crucial in any relationship. If she's going through his stuff without his consent, that's a breach of trust. He has the right to protect his personal space. Changing the passwords isn't about hiding something but about setting limits. So, the answer would likely be that he's not in the wrong because he's asserting his need for privacy after being disrespected.\n\nBut wait, maybe some might argue that once he shared the password, he can't take it back if he's the one who initiated the sharing. However, the context shows that he did it under the assumption of mutual trust, and when that trust was broken by her actions, changing the password is a reasonable response. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
