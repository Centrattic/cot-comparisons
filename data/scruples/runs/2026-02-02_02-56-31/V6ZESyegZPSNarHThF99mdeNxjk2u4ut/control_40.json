I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. So the situation is that the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password but later changed it when the girlfriend started going through his stuff. The girlfriend is upset because she feels this is a breach of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords is about mutual trust, and when he changed them, it felt like he's hiding something. On the other hand, the author might feel that his privacy is being invaded when she looks through his old data and messages. He's not hiding anything malicious, just personal stuff from the past.\n\nThe key points here are trust and privacy. The author isn't refusing to share passwords entirely; he did give her access initially. But when he noticed she was going through his personal data, he decided to protect his privacy by changing the passwords. This is a common issue in relationships where boundaries are not clearly set. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is important. While some people share devices and passwords as a sign of trust, others might still need personal space. The fact that the author isn't hiding anything but just wants privacy from prying eyes might be valid. However, the girlfriend might see it as a lack of trust. \n\nBut I think the main issue here is that the girlfriend is overstepping by going through his stuff without permission, even if she has the password. The author's action to protect his privacy is reasonable, especially if he's not hiding anything. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The answer should be B, No.\n"
