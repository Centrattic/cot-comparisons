I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The situation is that they moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. The user gave her the password but then she started prying into his past stuff, which embarrassed him. Now he's changing the passwords again to keep his privacy.\n\nHmm, the key points here are trust and privacy. The user initially gave the password, which he thought was okay because there was nothing to hide. But the girlfriend's actions\u2014going through his messages, finding old stuff from years ago\u2014made him uncomfortable. He's now taking steps to protect his privacy, which he feels is reasonable.\n\nOn one hand, sharing passwords could be seen as a sign of trust in a relationship. But on the other hand, everyone has a right to personal privacy. The girlfriend might feel that not allowing her access is a breach of trust, but the user is asserting his boundaries because of the invasion of privacy he experienced.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If the girlfriend was going through his private stuff without permission, then her actions are a problem. The user is just trying to protect his privacy after that happened. It seems like he's justified in setting boundaries here. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). The main issue is the girlfriend's behavior, not the user's decision to secure his devices again."
