I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user and his girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The user gave her his password but specified that he didn't need hers. However, she found some personal stuff in his browser history, old messages, and even went through his phone. The user is now changing the passwords to regain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should mean no secrets.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nLooking at the scenario, the user's actions are about setting boundaries for privacy. The girlfriend's behavior of going through his stuff without permission is a key point here. Even if the user initially gave her the password, he later changed it to prevent her from accessing without consent. The user isn't hiding anything malicious\u2014old messages, past relationships, etc.\u2014but they are personal. The user has the right to privacy, especially if the girlfriend is invading it without permission. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that sharing passwords is part of their trust. However, trust doesn't mean allowing someone to go through your personal data without consent. The user's decision to change passwords is a reasonable step to protect his privacy after being disrespected. \n\nThe user isn't doing anything unethical by securing his devices. The girlfriend's actions of snooping are the issue here. The user's response is a boundary-setting action, which is valid. So the answer should be B (No), the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
