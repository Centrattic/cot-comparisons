I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting to share passwords to show trust, but the author changed them to maintain privacy after their partner went through personal stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend wanted shared access, but the author felt privacy was important. The girlfriend went through old messages, found embarrassing content, and the author changed passwords to prevent that. The author doesn't have anything to hide but wants privacy, while the girlfriend feels they should trust each other.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is personal privacy. Some people might argue that if both are sharing, not doing the same is being inconsiderate. Others might say privacy is a right, especially in a relationship where trust exists but personal boundaries are still important. The fact that the author gave the password initially but then changed it after the girlfriend invaded their privacy complicates things. The author's actions could be seen as self-defense to protect their privacy, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping, so the author changing passwords isn't necessarily wrong. But there's also a balance between trust and privacy. Since the author explained their reasoning and the girlfriend was upset, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their privacy, even in a relationship. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
