  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend started going through their stuff. They moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. The user gave her their password but now feels privacy is an issue.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend is looking through old conversations, browser histories, and messages. The user wants to set boundaries and reclaim some privacy by changing passwords. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks trust should mean shared access.\n\nThe key points here are privacy vs. trust. In relationships, there's often a balance between sharing and maintaining individual privacy. The user isn't hiding anything; they're just uncomfortable with their past being pried into. The girlfriend's actions might be coming from a place of insecurity or wanting transparency, but the user has a right to personal space.\n\nIn many cases, people expect some level of privacy even in a relationship. For example, old messages or browsing history from years ago might not be relevant, but they can be embarrassing if found. Changing passwords to prevent unwanted access isn't necessarily wrong. It's about setting healthy boundaries.\n\nHowever, the user did initially agree to share the password, which the girlfriend might see as a commitment. But circumstances changed when the girlfriend started going through private stuff without consent. The user is now protecting their privacy after feeling violated.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Probably not. They're reacting to their boundaries being crossed. The real issue might be communication. They should talk to their girlfriend about why they need privacy and find a mutual understanding. But in terms of right or wrong, the user isn't at fault for protecting their personal space.\n"
