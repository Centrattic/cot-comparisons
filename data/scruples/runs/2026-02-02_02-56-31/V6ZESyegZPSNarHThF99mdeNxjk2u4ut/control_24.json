I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple moving in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after discovering she was going through his personal stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of boundaries and privacy. The author mentioned that he's not hiding anything, but he's uncomfortable with his partner accessing his past conversations and files. Even though there's nothing to be ashamed of, the embarrassment and invasion of privacy matters here. The girlfriend's actions\u2014going through messages without permission\u2014might be seen as a breach of trust, even if she's just trying to show she cares.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's privacy is important. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially if he feels his privacy is being invaded. Just because they're in a relationship doesn't mean all personal digital information should be accessible. The girlfriend's expectation of shared access might be a red flag if it's making the author uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did give the password initially, so he might have set a precedent that he's now reversing. That could be confusing or hurtful to the girlfriend. However, the key point is that the author changed his mind after experiencing privacy issues. His action is about reclaiming his personal space, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong for changing passwords? Probably not. He's addressing a privacy concern that's been violated. The girlfriend's approach might be overstepping, and the author's response is a way to set healthy boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
