I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The key points here are about privacy and trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been accessing the user's devices repeatedly, finding old messages, photos, and browser history. The user felt this was an invasion of privacy, even if the content isn't harmful. They decided to change passwords to regain some privacy, which the girlfriend is upset about, arguing that trust should mean sharing access.\n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, people have the right to personal boundaries. Even in a relationship, expecting someone not to look into your devices without permission can be reasonable. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially if she's doing it without the user's explicit consent each time. The user's response is about protecting their own space, which is a common issue in relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, trust is crucial. Sharing passwords can be a way to show openness. The user initially gave their password, perhaps to demonstrate trust, but the girlfriend used that access in ways the user found intrusive. The user is now setting boundaries, which is their right. It's a balance between trust and privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be more about feeling excluded or insecure, while the user is trying to maintain their privacy. The fact that the user is uncomfortable with old, irrelevant content being found suggests that the issue isn't about hiding something new but about past data they don't want scrutinized. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because they're establishing personal boundaries. Privacy is a valid need, even in a relationship. The girlfriend's behavior might need to change to respect those boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
