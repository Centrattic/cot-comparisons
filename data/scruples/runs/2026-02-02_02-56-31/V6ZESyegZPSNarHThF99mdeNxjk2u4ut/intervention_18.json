  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend went through their stuff. Hmm. The main issue here is privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nThe user gave the password willingly at first, probably to show trust. But then the girlfriend started digging into old stuff, which made the user uncomfortable. The user changed the passwords to maintain some privacy. Now the girlfriend is upset, thinking the user isn't trusting her.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, in a trusting relationship, sharing access might be expected, but on the other hand, everyone has a right to privacy. The user isn't hiding anything but feels their privacy is invaded. The girlfriend is crossing a boundary by going through personal messages and history without consent, even if she has the password.\n\nSo, the user's action of changing passwords is a way to set a boundary. They aren't hiding something; they just want their privacy respected. The girlfriend's behavior is the problem here. The user isn't in the wrong for asserting their need for privacy. The answer should be B (No).\n"
