  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. They moved in together, and she wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. He gave his password, but she went through his stuff and found old stuff that's embarrassing. Now he wants to change passwords for privacy, but she's upset. \n\nFirst, privacy is a big deal. Even in a relationship, people might expect some personal space. The girlfriend is invading his privacy by checking his devices without permission, which is a red flag. He's not doing anything illegal or unethical by wanting his privacy back. Trust is important, but mutual respect for boundaries is also key. If she's not respecting his privacy, maybe she's the one overstepping. The fact that he's embarrassed by old stuff she found doesn't mean he did anything wrong now. He's just reclaiming his right to privacy. So probably answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
