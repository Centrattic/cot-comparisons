I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about changing passwords to prevent a girlfriend from accessing personal devices. The author moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password because there's nothing to hide, but then the girlfriend started going through his stuff, finding old stuff like browser history, messages, etc. The author now wants to change passwords for privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, saying it's a trust issue.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me think about this. On one hand, sharing passwords can be a way to show trust in a relationship, especially when living together. The author did share once but then felt the need to take it back because of the girlfriend's actions. The girlfriend's behavior of going through his devices without permission might be a bigger issue. The author's right to privacy is important, even in a relationship. People have the right to personal space and privacy, so wanting to secure their devices again could be justified if the trust was breached.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author initially agreed to share passwords, so changing them might seem like breaking that trust. The girlfriend's argument is about mutual trust. However, the author explains that the girlfriend was prying into personal things, which is a violation of privacy. The author is not hiding anything new but is protecting past private information that's no longer relevant. So the action of changing passwords is to reclaim privacy after the trust was misused.\n\nFactors to consider: mutual consent, the girlfriend's actions, the author's right to privacy. The author isn't hiding current issues but is trying to prevent past private stuff from being accessed. The girlfriend's behavior is invasive, so the author's response is a reasonable step to protect privacy. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
