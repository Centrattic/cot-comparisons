  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. They moved in together, and she wanted shared passwords to show trust. He gave her his password initially, thinking there's nothing to hide. But then she found old stuff like browser history, Skype chats with an ex, old pictures, and even looked through his messages. He's uncomfortable with her going through his stuff and decided to change the passwords to regain privacy. Now she's upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. The key points here are privacy vs. trust. The user is trying to protect his personal information, which he feels is necessary because she's been going through his things. Even though he gave her the password initially, he's within his right to change it if he feels his privacy is being invaded. The girlfriend's actions of searching through his devices without his consent might be the real issue here. He's not hiding anything but wants his past digital stuff to stay private. So changing passwords to prevent further intrusion isn't necessarily wrong. It's about setting boundaries. But some might argue that sharing passwords is part of building trust in a relationship. However, trust shouldn't mean you have to expose all your past digital footprints. It's a balance between trust and respecting each other's privacy. The user isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by securing his devices. So probably answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
