I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices makes them the \"asshole.\" The situation is that they moved in together, and she wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. He gave her his password but then she went through his stuff, found old stuff, and now he's changing passwords again. He's worried about privacy versus trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords might be seen as a way to show trust in a relationship. But on the other hand, everyone deserves some privacy. The user might feel uncomfortable that his girlfriend is going through his personal data without permission, even if it's from the past. The key points here are consent and boundaries. \n\nHe mentioned that he's not hiding anything, but the invasion of privacy is making him feel embarrassed. It's about mutual respect. If she's entering his apps when he's not around, even if she has the password, that's a breach of his boundaries. He's setting a boundary by changing passwords again, which is his right. However, she might feel that he's not being transparent if he didn't discuss this before changing them.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He should talk to her about why he needs privacy and listen to her concerns. But the act of changing passwords isn't inherently wrong. People have the right to privacy, even in relationships. So, the user isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
