I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices anymore. They moved in together, and she wanted shared passwords to show trust. He agreed initially but now she's been going through his private stuff, which he finds embarrassing. He's decided to change the passwords to maintain privacy, but she's upset and says they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, sharing passwords might be a way to show openness in a relationship, but it's also a personal boundary. The user didn't want to do it initially and has the right to protect their privacy. The girlfriend's actions of checking his messages and history without consent might be a bigger issue here. Privacy is a reasonable expectation even in a relationship. \n\nThe key points are consent and mutual respect. The user isn't hiding anything harmful; it's just old, personal stuff. If the user feels uncomfortable, changing passwords to set boundaries is justified. The girlfriend's lack of respecting his privacy seems more problematic. So, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because maintaining personal privacy is reasonable, especially when the partner isn't respecting boundaries.\n"
