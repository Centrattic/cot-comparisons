I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. Hmm.\n\nSo the situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password but then found out the girlfriend was going through his messages and old stuff, like browser history, Skype conversations with an ex, and pictures on an old phone. The author is changing the passwords back to have privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she feels they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's argument is about trust and sharing. She might feel that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust. But the author is concerned about privacy and being embarrassed over old, irrelevant stuff. The author might feel that even if there's nothing to hide, past conversations shouldn't be an issue now. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. While sharing can be a sign of trust, everyone has the right to some privacy. The girlfriend might be overstepping by going through old messages and files without consent, even if the author gave the password. The author could argue that after seeing what happened, they have the right to revoke access to protect their privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did give the password initially, so there's an expectation of trust. Changing passwords after that might seem like a betrayal of trust. But maybe the author realized that sharing passwords led to invasion of privacy, which is a valid concern.\n\nI think it's a balance between trust and privacy. The author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to privacy. The problem here is that the girlfriend is prying into things that are none of her business. The author is trying to set boundaries to maintain that privacy, which is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
