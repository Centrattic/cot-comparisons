I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that they moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after she found some old, possibly sensitive stuff. Now the girlfriend is upset, feeling it's a lack of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is about trust and openness in a relationship. She might feel that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust, especially since she already has access. On the other hand, the author wants privacy, especially for personal data from the past that's not relevant anymore. They might feel that their privacy is being invaded when the girlfriend goes through their messages and history without consent.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is mutual respect for privacy. The key point here is consent for access. The author might have given the password initially without clear boundaries, which led to the girlfriend accessing private information. By changing the password, the author is setting boundaries to protect their privacy, which is a reasonable expectation. However, the girlfriend might see this as breaking the trust they established. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some relationships, sharing passwords is seen as normal, but others might view it as an invasion of privacy. The author's actions are about reclaiming personal space, which is their right. The girlfriend's actions of going through messages without permission are problematic, as privacy is a two-way street. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for changing passwords to maintain their privacy. The girlfriend's initial request for access was invasive, and the author's response is a way to set healthy boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
