I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared access to show trust, but the author felt privacy was important. The girlfriend kept going through his stuff, which made him uncomfortable, so he changed the passwords.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about privacy. Even in a relationship, people might want some personal space. The girl, on the other hand, sees sharing passwords as trust. But she's also invading his privacy by checking his messages and history without consent, which is a problem.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything malicious, just personal stuff from the past. The girlfriend's actions of going through his devices without permission are a breach of trust. The author changing passwords to protect his privacy isn't wrong; he's setting a boundary. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is respecting each other's need for privacy. The girlfriend's behavior was intrusive, so the author's response is reasonable. He's not being secretive but rather protecting his personal data. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
