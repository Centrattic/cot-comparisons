I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple moving in together and sharing passwords. The girlfriend wanted access to his devices, and he gave her the password. She then looked through his stuff, found old stuff that's embarrassing, and he changed the passwords again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author gave the password initially, trusting her. But then she went through his private data without his consent, which he found intrusive. He changed the passwords to regain privacy. The main issue here is consent and boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. Even in a committed relationship, individuals might have different comfort levels regarding privacy. The girlfriend's actions of searching through his messages and other data without a clear reason could be seen as a violation of his privacy. The author is setting a boundary to protect his personal space, which is a reasonable action. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that not sharing passwords creates a barrier in trust. However, the initial agreement was mutual sharing, but when one party starts using that access to intrude into private matters, it's a problem. The author's response is about reclaiming control over his privacy, which is a valid need. \n\nIt's possible that communication was lacking. The author should have discussed his concerns about privacy from the start. However, after the invasion of privacy occurred, changing passwords is a way to prevent further issues. The girlfriend's perspective is important, but so is the author's right to privacy. Since the action was a response to her overstepping, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
