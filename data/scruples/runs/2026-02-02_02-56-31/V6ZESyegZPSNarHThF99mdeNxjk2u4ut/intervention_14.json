I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're at fault for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The user agreed to give her their password but now feels the need to take it back. The girlfriend found some old stuff, like porn history, old Skype chats with an ex, and pictures from a long time ago. She also went through his messages when he wasn't around. The user is changing passwords again to protect their privacy, but the girlfriend is upset because she feels this is a breach of trust.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about privacy vs. trust in a relationship. The user is concerned about their personal space and not wanting to be embarrassed by past stuff. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees shared passwords as a sign of trust. But the user didn't have access to her passwords, so there's an imbalance. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, consent and mutual agreement are important. They initially gave the password, but now they want to revoke it. The user has a right to privacy, especially in their own devices. The girlfriend's actions of going through messages without permission might be the bigger issue here. \n\nChanging passwords to protect personal information isn't inherently wrong. It's about setting boundaries. The user isn't hiding anything malicious; it's just old, irrelevant things. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from insecurity or misunderstanding about privacy in a relationship. \n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily at fault for wanting to maintain some level of privacy. The problem might be that the expectation of complete transparency isn't realistic unless both parties agree to it. The answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
