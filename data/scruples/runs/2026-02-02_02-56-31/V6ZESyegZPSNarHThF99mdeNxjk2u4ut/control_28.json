I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about changing passwords after the girlfriend started going through his stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The guy and his girlfriend moved in together. She wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. He agreed to give her his passwords, saying there's nothing to hide. But then she found old stuff like porn history, old Skype messages with an ex, and even went through his phone messages. He found this embarrassing and decided to change his passwords to regain privacy. Now she's upset, saying they should trust each other. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust, privacy, and boundaries. The guy initially agreed to share his passwords but later changed his mind because his girlfriend was invading his privacy. The question is whether he's in the wrong for setting boundaries after agreeing to share.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is important, but so is mutual respect for each other's privacy. The girlfriend might feel that by changing the passwords, he's being dishonest or breaking the trust he initially showed. However, the guy's actions were in response to her invading his privacy, which is a reasonable reaction. People have the right to their own privacy, even in a relationship. If she's going through his stuff without permission, that's the real issue. The guy is just asserting his boundaries again, which is a healthy thing to do in a relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that he gave her the password initially doesn't obligate him to keep it that way if he feels uncomfortable. He had the right to reconsider, especially after experiencing her snooping. The girlfriend's actions of checking his messages and old devices without his knowledge are the ones that might be more problematic here.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. He's taking steps to protect his privacy after a breach of trust from his partner. The real issue is her respecting his privacy and boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
