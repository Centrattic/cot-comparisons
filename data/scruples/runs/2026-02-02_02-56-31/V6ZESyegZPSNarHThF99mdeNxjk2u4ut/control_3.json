I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords after their girlfriend went through their stuff is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The guy gave her his password because he didn't mind, thinking there was nothing to hide. But then she found old stuff like browser history, old messages, and even checked his phone. He felt embarrassed and decided to change his passwords to regain some privacy. He's now wondering if he's the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective: she might believe that sharing passwords is about trust and transparency, so when he takes them back, it could feel like a betrayal or a lack of trust. She might argue that if there's nothing to hide, he shouldn't need privacy. On the other hand, the guy's side is that he's entitled to his own privacy, even in a relationship. The fact that she went through his messages without his consent is a red flag. People have the right to their personal space and past communications, even if they're in a relationship now.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The girlfriend invading his personal devices without his permission is a violation of his privacy. The guy setting boundaries by changing passwords is a reasonable response to protect his privacy after his trust was broken. So, even though the girlfriend might see it as a lack of trust, the guy is just asserting his right to privacy. Therefore, he's not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
