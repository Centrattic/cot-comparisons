I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords after their girlfriend was going through their stuff is in the wrong. The situation is moving in together, sharing passwords, but then the girlfriend accessed private info and messages. The person changed passwords to maintain privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend wanted shared access as a sign of trust. The author gave his password but set boundaries. However, she went through his things, found old messages, and he felt privacy was invaded. He changed passwords to regain control. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but privacy is also a personal right. Even in a committed relationship, individuals might want some privacy. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping, especially if she accessed his phone without consent when he wasn't around. \n\nThe author isn't hiding anything malicious, just old stuff that's not relevant anymore. By changing passwords, he's protecting his personal space. The girlfriend might feel hurt because he's setting a boundary, but that doesn't mean he's wrong. Trust doesn't necessarily mean giving up all privacy. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy after his boundaries were crossed. The problem is more about the girlfriend respecting those boundaries instead of expecting full access.\n"
