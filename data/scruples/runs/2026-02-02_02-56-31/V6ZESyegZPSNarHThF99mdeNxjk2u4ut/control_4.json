I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust, but when the author gave hers, she started going through his old data and private messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is about trust and transparency in the relationship. She might feel that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust. On the other hand, the author is asserting their right to privacy. Even though they live together, personal devices often have sensitive information that individuals might want to keep private.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author initially gave the password but changed it after feeling that the privacy was being invaded. The girlfriend's actions, like going through messages and old data, might be seen as overstepping without permission. The author has a right to set boundaries about their personal space, even in a relationship.\n\nHowever, communication is crucial. The author should have discussed their discomfort with the girlfriend before changing the passwords. Maybe explaining why the privacy matters could have helped. But the action itself isn't inherently wrong if both parties have mutual respect for each other's boundaries.\n\nSo, considering that the author is setting personal boundaries and the girlfriend's actions were intrusive, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). The issue is more about the lack of communication rather than the act of changing passwords. The author isn't wrong for seeking privacy, especially if the girlfriend's actions made them uncomfortable.\n"
