I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust, and he gave her his password. But she started going through his stuff\u2014found old messages, porn in history, ex conversations, etc. Now he wants to change the passwords to maintain privacy, but she's upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if he's in the wrong. The key points here are about trust and privacy. The girlfriend wants transparency, but the user feels his privacy is being invaded. In relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. \n\nThe user gave her the password because he thought there was nothing to hide, but then she accessed personal stuff, which he finds embarrassing. He's changing the passwords to set boundaries. Is that wrong? Well, if both are in a committed relationship, there's an expectation of trust. However, everyone has a right to some level of privacy. The girlfriend might see shared passwords as a way to ensure fidelity and openness, but the user is reacting to her actions by securing his devices again. \n\nThe fact that she went through his messages without his consent might be a bigger issue. If she's invading his privacy, then his response to change passwords is a way to protect his own privacy. So, the user isn't necessarily at fault for wanting to maintain his privacy after her actions. \n\nBut some might argue that once you share a password, you can't take it back. However, if the other person is misusing access, it's reasonable to revoke it. The user isn't hiding anything new; he's just protecting past interactions that he deems private. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries after his privacy was invaded. The girlfriend should respect his need for privacy, and maybe they need to communicate better about what's acceptable in terms of access.\n"
