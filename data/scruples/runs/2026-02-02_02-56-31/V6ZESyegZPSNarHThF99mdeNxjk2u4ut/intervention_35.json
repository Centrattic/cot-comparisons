I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend went through their personal data. They gave her the password initially, but she found stuff from the past and started looking through their phone. The key points here are trust, privacy, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a gesture of trust. The person agreed but set boundaries for themselves, which is reasonable. However, the girlfriend didn't respect those boundaries by going through old messages and other personal items. The person then changed their passwords to regain privacy, which is a response to the invasion of their personal space.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for privacy is important. Just because someone wants transparency doesn't mean the other has to give up their privacy. The girlfriend's actions (looking through messages, past conversations) show a lack of respect for the person's boundaries. The person changing passwords is a way to protect their own privacy, which is a valid response. It's about setting healthy boundaries. So, the person isn't in the wrong for taking steps to maintain their privacy after the trust was broken. Answer B.\n"
