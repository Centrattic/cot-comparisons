I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is at fault for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The situation involves trust and privacy in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author gave their password to the girlfriend initially, but then changed it after she went through their personal stuff. The girlfriend argues that sharing passwords shows trust, but the author feels the need for privacy. \n\nI need to consider both sides. In relationships, mutual trust is important, but personal privacy should also be respected. The girlfriend's actions of going through the author's messages and apps without permission might be an overstep. The author might feel that their boundaries were violated, so changing passwords to protect their privacy is a reasonable response. \n\nHowever, communication is key. The author could have discussed their discomfort with the girlfriend's actions before changing passwords. But since the girlfriend was already overstepping by accessing personal information, the author's decision to secure their devices might be justified. \n\nCultural and societal norms vary, but generally, people have the right to privacy, even in a relationship. The fact that the author mentioned there's nothing to hide but still wants privacy suggests it's about personal space rather than secrecy. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction could indicate she didn't respect the author's boundaries, making the author's action a necessary step to maintain their own comfort and privacy. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
