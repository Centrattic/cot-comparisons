  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend went through their stuff.\n\nSo, the situation is they moved in together and she wanted to share passwords to show trust. The user agreed to give her their password because they had nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found old stuff, like porn, old messages, and photos, and even went through their phone. The user now wants to change the passwords to maintain privacy. The girlfriend thinks that's not trusting her.\n\nHmm, the key points here are privacy vs. trust. The user is not hiding anything, but they feel their privacy is being invaded. They gave the password, but then the girlfriend used it to look into things the user didn't want her to see. The user is reacting by changing passwords, which the girlfriend sees as a lack of trust.\n\nI think the user has a right to their privacy. Even in a relationship, personal devices often have private information. The girlfriend might have good intentions, but going through messages and apps without permission is a breach of trust. The user is setting a boundary here, which is important. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because they're protecting their privacy after experiencing invasion. The girlfriend needs to respect that boundary. So, the user isn't wrong for changing the passwords to maintain their privacy even if they trust her, because trust shouldn't mean total access to everything.\n"
