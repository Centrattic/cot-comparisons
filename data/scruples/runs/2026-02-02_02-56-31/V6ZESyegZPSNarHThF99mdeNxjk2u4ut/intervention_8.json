  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices anymore. They moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. The user agreed to give her the password, but then the girlfriend found some old stuff and was going through his messages. Now he's changing the passwords again because he wants privacy, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. Trust is a big part of relationships, but so is personal privacy. The user initially gave the password because he felt there was nothing to hide. But then his girlfriend started going through his private data\u2014browser history, old messages, ex's stuff, even his phone when he wasn't around. That's a privacy issue. The user then changes the password to regain control over his own privacy, which is understandable. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that once you share passwords, you're supposed to trust each other. But if one person is using that access to invade the other's privacy, that's a problem. The user isn't hiding anything new; he's just protecting past content that's irrelevant now. The fact that she felt the need to look through his stuff without his permission suggests a lack of respect for his boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and boundaries are important. The user is setting a boundary here by changing the password. He's not doing it to hide something new but to prevent further intrusion into his past. The girlfriend might feel betrayed, but her actions were the initial breach. The user isn't in the wrong for reclaiming his privacy. So the answer is B.\n"
