  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend was going through their stuff. So, first, I need to break down the situation. They moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The user gave her their password because they thought there was nothing to hide. Then the girlfriend found old stuff like porn, old conversations, etc., and even looked through his messages. The user is now changing passwords to regain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, saying trust is important.\n\nHmm, so the user is trying to balance privacy and trust. They didn't mind sharing some info but were uncomfortable with her prying into personal data. The key points here are the boundaries of privacy in a relationship and mutual respect. The user isn't hiding anything malicious; they just want their past to stay private. The girlfriend's actions, like looking through messages without permission, might be an issue here. \n\nI need to consider whether it's reasonable to have privacy in a relationship. Even in a trusting relationship, people often have personal boundaries. The user isn't keeping secrets that affect the relationship, just old, irrelevant stuff. The girlfriend's reaction to changing passwords suggests she might not respect his need for privacy. \n\nSo, from a typical perspective, expecting complete transparency might be too much. The user isn't doing anything wrong by setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). The main factors are mutual respect for each other's privacy and the fact that the user isn't hiding anything harmful.\n"
