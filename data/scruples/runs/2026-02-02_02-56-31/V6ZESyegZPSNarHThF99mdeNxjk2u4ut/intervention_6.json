  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. They moved in together, and she wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The user gave her their password, but she ended up going through his private information, which made him uncomfortable. Now he's changing his passwords to regain privacy.\n\nFirst, the key points here are privacy versus trust. The girlfriend wanted shared access, possibly to show commitment in the relationship. But the user found that his privacy was being invaded. He's not hiding anything; the content she found is old and irrelevant now. The issue is about respect for personal boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. However, that doesn't mean everyone has to give up all privacy. Even in committed relationships, people might expect some level of personal space. The girlfriend might see shared passwords as a way to demonstrate trust, but the user is uncomfortable with her accessing his personal data. Changing passwords isn't about hiding something new\u2014it's about protecting old, irrelevant data that's now causing embarrassment.\n\nThe user's action is a way to set a boundary. He's not doing anything malicious; he's just trying to reclaim his privacy after feeling it was violated. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not understand that privacy and trust aren't mutually exclusive. It's possible she feels insecure or that the user isn't fully committed if he's keeping his information private.\n\nBut considering that he's not hiding current activities and is upfront about his reasons, changing passwords is a reasonable response to protect his past, which is none of her concern. So, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
