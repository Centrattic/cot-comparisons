I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation involves trust, privacy, and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initially asked for shared passwords, which the author agreed to after some hesitation. Then the girlfriend found various things in the author's history and devices, which embarrassed the author. The author then decided to change passwords to regain privacy, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author gave the password voluntarily, expecting mutual respect for privacy. However, the girlfriend didn't respect that expectation by looking through personal data. The author's response is to take back control of their privacy by changing passwords. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is individual privacy. Just because someone shares a password doesn't mean they have the right to invade the other's personal digital space. The author has a right to their own privacy, especially regarding old, irrelevant content that wasn't meant to be shared. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel hurt because she perceives the password change as a lack of trust. But the author's action is more about setting boundaries rather than breaking trust. The author isn't hiding something harmful; it's about personal history that's not relevant now. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy after their boundaries were crossed. The issue here is more about the girlfriend overstepping than the author being at fault.\n"
