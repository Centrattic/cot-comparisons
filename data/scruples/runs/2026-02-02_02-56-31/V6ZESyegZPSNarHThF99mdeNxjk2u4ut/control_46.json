I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend wanting access to the partner's devices, and the partner deciding to change passwords to maintain privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend wanted shared access as a trust gesture, but the guy didn't want to share his passwords except when he felt there was no issue. However, after giving her access, she went through his stuff and found old stuff that was embarrassing. Now he wants to change passwords to regain privacy.\n\nThe main conflict here is about privacy versus trust. The question is whether changing passwords is justified. In relationships, trust is important, but individuals also have a right to personal privacy. The guy isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just uncomfortable with his past being prised open without consent. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that trust should mean no privacy barriers. But if someone is sifting through old messages and photos without a valid reason, that could be overstepping. The guy's action is to protect his personal space, which is reasonable. \n\nI think the guy isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy within the relationship. The issue might be more about setting boundaries and communication. Maybe they need to talk about what's acceptable and what's not regarding personal devices. But based on the situation, changing passwords to prevent unauthorized access isn't wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
