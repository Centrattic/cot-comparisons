I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user and their girlfriend moved in together. She asked to share passwords as a sign of trust. The user agreed to give her their password but also mentioned that he didn't need her passwords because he doesn't see a reason to look through her stuff. Then, after sharing the password, the girlfriend found some stuff like old porn history, old Skype chats with an ex, old photos, and even went through his messages when he wasn't around. The user now wants to change passwords to regain some privacy, but the girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other. The user is conflicted and asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of privacy in relationships. Even in committed relationships, people often expect some level of privacy. The user isn't hiding anything malicious; the content found is old and not relevant anymore. The fact that the girlfriend went through his messages when he wasn't there might indicate a breach of trust from her side. The user's action of changing passwords is about maintaining personal space, which is a reasonable request. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords is a mutual trust gesture.\n\nBut the user already gave the password, and the girlfriend used it to invade his privacy. The user's response is to set boundaries, which is a normal reaction. The key point is whether maintaining personal privacy is acceptable. In many relationships, boundaries are important, and it's okay to have some privacy as long as there's no deceit. The user isn't hiding anything harmful; it's more about personal history that's not relevant now. \n\nOn the other hand, if both agreed to share passwords, then changing them could be seen as breaking that agreement. But the user didn't ask for her password, and she went through his stuff without his consent. That's a bigger issue. The user's action is a way to enforce mutual respect for each other's privacy. \n\nSo, the main conflict is between her expectation of full access (since they shared passwords) versus his need for privacy. The user isn't in the wrong for trying to set boundaries after experiencing privacy violations. The problem might be more on the girlfriend's side for not respecting his privacy even after he gave her access. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
