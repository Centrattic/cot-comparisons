I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting shared passwords to show trust, but then she's going through his stuff, which makes him uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend initiated the idea of sharing passwords, and the guy agreed to give her his password. But then she's prying into his past stuff like browser history, old messages, etc. He feels the need to regain some privacy by changing his passwords, which upsets her because she feels it's a breach of trust.\n\nThe key points here are trust, privacy, and mutual respect. The guy might be in the right because everyone deserves some personal space, even in a relationship. The girlfriend might be overstepping by going through his private data, even if he gave her the password. However, the guy did agree to share the password initially, so changing it without discussing it could be seen as a betrayal of trust. But maybe the context is important here\u2014since she's already invading his privacy by looking through his messages and old files, he's within his rights to protect his information.\n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend's actions (finding porn, checking messages) are intrusive. If she's doing that without his consent, even with the password, he has a legitimate reason to want privacy. The fact that he's not hiding anything but just wants to keep past stuff private is valid. People have the right to control access to their personal data.\n\nOn the other hand, changing the password without communication might come off as a sudden move that disregards her feelings. He could have discussed his discomfort with her prying first. But given that she was already invading his privacy, maybe he felt it was necessary to take action without further discussion.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's asserting his right to privacy after she overstepped. The problem isn't just about the password change but about mutual respect in the relationship. If she's not respecting his boundaries by going through his data, his response is justified.\n"
