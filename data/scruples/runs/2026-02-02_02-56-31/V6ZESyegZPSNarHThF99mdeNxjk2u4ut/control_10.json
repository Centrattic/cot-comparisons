I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about privacy versus trust in a relationship. \n\nSo, the guy gave his girlfriend his password to show trust, but then she went through his stuff. He found that uncomfortable and changed the passwords. Now she's upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords can be a way to show trust, and if he gave her access, maybe she felt she had the right to look. On the other hand, he has a right to privacy, especially regarding old, irrelevant stuff that's now causing embarrassment. \n\nHe mentioned that the things she found were from the past and mean nothing now. Being walked in on while she was checking his messages might make him feel violated. Changing passwords to maintain privacy isn't about hiding something new; it's about personal space. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is respect for boundaries. If he's not hiding anything current, just old stuff, then changing passwords is reasonable. She might be overstepping by going through his devices without a valid reason. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect of boundaries and the fact that the guy isn't hiding anything new. The answer leans towards him not being in the wrong because he's reasserting his privacy after his boundaries were crossed.\n"
