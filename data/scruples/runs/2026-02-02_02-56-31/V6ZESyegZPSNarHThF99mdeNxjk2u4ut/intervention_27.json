I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their computer or phone. They moved in together, and she wanted to share passwords as a trust thing. He gave her his password but now she's been going through his stuff, finding old messages and photos. He's changing passwords to protect his privacy, but she's upset, saying there's no reason since they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. The key points here are trust, privacy, and boundaries. The user gave her his password to show trust, but she's using it to invade his privacy. He's uncomfortable with that and wants to set boundaries, so he changes the passwords. From the AITA perspective, the question is whether he's justified in doing that despite her expectations.\n\nFirst, trust in a relationship is important, but so is individual privacy. When you're in a relationship, especially when moving in together, there might be expectations of transparency, but that doesn't mean all personal data should be accessible. The girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through messages, checking browser history\u2014seem like privacy invasions. The user feels that by setting boundaries, he's protecting his personal space, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that not keeping the passwords open is a breach of trust. But the user is not hiding anything; he's just reclaiming his privacy after she overstepped. The fact that she found old stuff that's not relevant anymore but still makes him embarrassed might indicate she's prying into areas that are personal. Changing passwords to prevent this isn't about hiding, but about mutual respect for boundaries.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's taking a stand for his privacy after her actions have made him uncomfortable. The right answer would be B.\n"
