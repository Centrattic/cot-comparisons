I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about changing passwords after the girlfriend started going through his personal stuff. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her his password initially, saying there's nothing to hide. But then she found some personal things like old browser history, messages, pictures, and even used his phone when he wasn't around. He found this embarrassing and decided to change his passwords to regain some privacy.\n\nThe key question is whether he's at fault for doing that. On one hand, he gave her access voluntarily, and she might feel hurt that he's withdrawing it. On the other hand, he's within his rights to protect his privacy. The problem here is mutual trust. He might be in the right because privacy is a valid concern. Even if you share a life with someone, personal devices can still be private. She accessed his things without consent, which is an issue. Changing passwords is a reasonable step to prevent that. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. But maybe some would argue he should have communicated better before revoking access. But given her actions, he's justified in seeking privacy.\n"
