I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The question is about changing passwords to prevent a girlfriend from accessing their devices. The user moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The user gave her their password, but then the girlfriend went through personal stuff like browser history, old messages, and even looked through the phone when they weren't around. The user is now changing passwords again to regain privacy and is being told by the girlfriend that this is a breach of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user gave their password initially, which the girlfriend then used to access personal information. The user argues that even though there's nothing to hide, they want privacy to avoid embarrassment from old, irrelevant content. The user is changing passwords again to set boundaries, but the girlfriend is upset, seeing it as a lack of trust.\n\nSo, who is right? In relationships, trust and boundaries are important. The user might feel their privacy is being invaded, even if there's no malicious intent. The girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through messages without permission\u2014could be seen as crossing a boundary. The user's decision to change passwords could be a way to protect their privacy, which is a valid need. However, the girlfriend might see this as a step back from the trust they were building.\n\nBut the user initially gave the password, which might have given the impression that it was okay to access the devices. Now changing it might be seen as breaking that trust. But if the user felt their privacy was being overstepped, then it's about setting personal boundaries. Privacy is a personal right, and even in relationships, people often expect some level of privacy. The fact that the girlfriend accessed the content without being asked to do so is a key point. The user might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect their own space, especially if the girlfriend is prying into old, irrelevant matters. The user's action is about self-respect and setting limits, which is important in any relationship. So, the answer might be B, the user is not in the wrong. They have the right to privacy and are reacting to a breach of that privacy.\n"
