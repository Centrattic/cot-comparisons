  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. They moved in together, and she wanted shared passwords to show trust. He gave her his password but later changed it when she started going through things like browser history, old messages, etc. He's upset because she's invading his privacy, even though he had nothing to hide. The question is whether he's in the wrong for changing the passwords.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend wants transparency and trust, which is common in relationships. She might feel that having access is a sign of commitment and openness. But on the other hand, everyone has a right to some level of privacy. Even if there's nothing to hide, personal items like old messages or history can be embarrassing or irrelevant. The user is setting boundaries to protect his privacy, which is reasonable.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The user agreed to share his password initially, maybe to accommodate her feelings, but then changed it when he felt his privacy was being invaded. He communicated his discomfort, which is important. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she values trust and transparency, but maybe she didn't consider that personal boundaries are also important. \n\nIn relationships, balance is key. Trust doesn't mean giving up all privacy. It's about mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The user isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by changing his passwords. He's protecting his personal space, which is a valid right. The girlfriend might need to understand that privacy and trust can coexist. So, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong) because he's asserting his right to privacy after a breach of trust from her side.\n"
