I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about changing passwords to keep a girlfriend from accessing their devices. The girlfriend wanted shared access to show trust, but the author changed the passwords after she went through some old stuff. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that their privacy is being invaded when the girlfriend goes through their old data, like browser history, Skype conversations, and messages. That's personal stuff, even if it's not current. The author might not want others rummaging through their past, even if there's nothing to hide. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend sees sharing passwords as a sign of trust. She might feel hurt that the author is now blocking access after having shared them initially. She might argue that if there's nothing to hide, there's no need to change the passwords. \n\nBut the key point here is the author's right to privacy. Even in a relationship, people often expect some level of personal space. The girlfriend's actions\u2014going through messages and apps without permission\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The author changing passwords is a way to set boundaries. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their privacy. The girlfriend might need to respect that. Trust doesn't mean you have to share every part of your digital life, especially if it's causing discomfort. The author is trying to find a balance between trust and personal space. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
