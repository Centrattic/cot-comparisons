I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting to share passwords to show trust, but when the user gave her access, she found some old stuff and invaded their privacy. Now the user is changing passwords again for privacy, and the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might feel that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust, especially since she was given access initially. But the user is concerned about their privacy and being embarrassed over old, irrelevant content that an ex found. They also mention that the girlfriend looked through their messages, which is a privacy violation. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is personal privacy. People have the right to keep certain things private, even in a committed relationship. The girlfriend's actions of going through the user's devices without consent are problematic. The user's response to change passwords to regain control over their privacy seems reasonable. \n\nHowever, the user did give the password initially, which might have set an expectation for continued access. But the user changed their mind after experiencing privacy breaches. It's important to communicate boundaries clearly. The user isn't hiding something; they just want to protect their personal space. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The user has a right to their privacy, especially after their partner invaded it. Setting boundaries through passwords is a reasonable step. The girlfriend might need to respect that, even if it feels like a lack of trust. Open communication about these boundaries is key, but the action itself isn't wrong.\n"
