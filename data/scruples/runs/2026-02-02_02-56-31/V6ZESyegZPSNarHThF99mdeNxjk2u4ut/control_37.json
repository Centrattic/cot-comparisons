I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about moving in with a girlfriend and sharing passwords. The guy gave her his passwords initially because he said there's nothing to hide, but then she went through his stuff and found old stuff that's embarrassing. Now he wants to change the passwords to have privacy, and she's upset because she thinks they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about trust, privacy, and boundaries in a relationship. The guy feels that even though there's nothing to hide, the fact that she's going through his personal data without consent is an issue. He's not hiding anything malicious, just old stuff that's not relevant anymore. He wants his privacy back, so he changes the passwords. She's upset because she sees it as breaking trust.\n\nI think the question is whether the guy has a right to privacy even in a relationship. In many relationships, people might expect some level of privacy, even when sharing a home. The girlfriend's actions\u2014going through his messages and apps\u2014could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's doing it without his consent. The fact that she found old conversations and images and brought them up might be causing unnecessary conflict. \n\nThe guy's response is to set a boundary by changing passwords. That's a reasonable way to protect his privacy. The girlfriend might not understand that, but the issue is about mutual respect. Even if they share some things, there's a line where personal data and past interactions should stay private unless the person is comfortable sharing them. \n\nSo, the guy isn't being wrong for wanting to protect his own information. He's not hiding anything harmful, just asserting his right to privacy. The girlfriend's reaction is about trust, but trust shouldn't require full access to someone's personal devices and messages without consent. Healthy relationships involve both trust and respecting boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's setting a boundary that's necessary for his comfort and privacy.\n"
