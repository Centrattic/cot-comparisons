I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password, but then the girlfriend found various personal items in the browser history, old messages, and even went through his phone messages when he wasn't around. The author felt uncomfortable with her invading his privacy, even though he acknowledged there's nothing to hide. He decided to change the passwords again to maintain some privacy, which upset her because she felt it was a breach of trust.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Trust in relationships is important, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend expected full access because of trust, but the author feels that privacy is also necessary. The key points are whether the author's actions are reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe girlfriend went through his messages and found old content. Even if the content is harmless, the act of going through someone's private messages without permission is a privacy violation. The author had initially given the password but now wants his privacy back because of these invasions. Changing passwords in response to unwanted access isn't inherently wrong. The author is setting boundaries to protect his personal space, which is a common need in relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that changing passwords is a lack of trust. However, the author isn't hiding anything; he's just reclaiming his privacy after his boundaries were crossed. The problem might stem from miscommunication about what mutual trust entails. The author might need to explain that trust doesn't mean unlimited access to personal devices.\n\nIs there a cultural or societal norm here? In many cases, people do share some information in a relationship but still maintain personal privacy. The author isn't hiding harmful things but rather personal history that's irrelevant now. His actions are about maintaining personal space, which is valid.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior of going through his messages without his knowledge is the real issue here. The author's response is a way to prevent future invasions of privacy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. He's taking a reasonable step to protect his privacy after her actions made him uncomfortable.\n"
