I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about changing passwords to maintain privacy after a partner has gone through their personal stuff.\n\nFirst, the user (author) and his girlfriend moved in together. She wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author was okay giving her the password but didn't want her to have access. But he gave it anyway because he felt there was nothing to hide. Then she found some personal stuff\u2014porn in browser history, old Skype messages with an ex, old phone pictures, and even looked through his messages. The author then decided to change the passwords to regain some privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she feels there should be mutual trust.\n\nThe core issue is about privacy versus trust. The author might feel that even though he's not hiding anything, his past interactions and files are personal and shouldn't be pried into. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that sharing passwords is a way to show commitment and transparency. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is important. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just seeking privacy over old, irrelevant data. The fact that she went through his things without his knowledge might be the bigger issue here. Changing passwords could be his way of setting a boundary to prevent further intrusion. \n\nSociety often expects partners to share certain aspects, but that shouldn't override individual privacy rights. The key is whether the author is justified in protecting his privacy, even if it doesn't involve secrets. Since the author isn't preventing her from doing something harmful\u2014just protecting his personal history\u2014it's more about respecting personal boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to protect his privacy after experiencing privacy breaches.\n"
