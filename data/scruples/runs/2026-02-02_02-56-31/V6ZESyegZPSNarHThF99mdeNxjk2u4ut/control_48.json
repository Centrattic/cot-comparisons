I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend asked to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password because he had nothing to hide, but then she found various things in his history and messages. He feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so he changes his passwords. She's upset because she thinks they should trust each other.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the key points here are privacy vs. trust. The author is trying to maintain his privacy after feeling that his personal data was being accessed without his consent. He mentioned that he doesn't care about the content but finds it embarrassing. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees sharing passwords as a trust issue. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. Even if you're in a relationship, individuals should have the right to their own privacy. The girlfriend went through his messages and found things, which might not have been consensual. The author changing the passwords could be seen as setting a boundary to protect his privacy. \n\nBut some might argue that if they agreed to share passwords, he's breaking that trust by changing them. However, the original agreement might have been one-sided. The author didn't want her passwords in return, which shows he already felt some privacy was necessary. Also, she was accessing his devices without his permission, which is an issue. \n\nSo, the author is trying to correct an imbalance where his privacy was invaded. Changing passwords to prevent further intrusion is a reasonable step. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
