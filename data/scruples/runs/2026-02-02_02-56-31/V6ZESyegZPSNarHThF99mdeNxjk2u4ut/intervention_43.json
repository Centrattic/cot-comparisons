I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a gesture of trust. The man agreed to give her his password, but he didn't reciprocate by asking for hers, stating he didn't see a reason. Now, she's found things like past conversations, old photos, and he's noticed her going through his messages. He feels embarrassed by this invasion of privacy and decides to change his passwords to regain some privacy. She's upset because she feels this is a betrayal of trust.\n\nThe user is asking if changing the passwords makes him the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords could be seen as a way to build trust in a relationship. If he agreed to share his password, maybe she felt it was mutual, so him changing it might seem like he's hiding something now. On the other hand, he has a right to privacy. Even in a relationship, people might want to keep certain things personal, especially if they're old and not relevant. The fact that she went through his messages without asking could be a breach of his boundaries. He might have felt uncomfortable and decided to set boundaries by changing the passwords.\n\nIs it wrong to change passwords to protect one's privacy? Not necessarily. Everyone deserves some level of privacy. The key issue here is communication. Did he explain his reasons for changing the passwords? If he changed them without discussing it, that might cause confusion. But in this case, he mentioned he told her he was doing it because he wanted privacy. She was upset, but maybe that's because she didn't expect it after sharing his password.\n\nAlso, her actions\u2014looking through his messages and finding old stuff\u2014might have made him uncomfortable. If he felt his privacy was being invaded, changing passwords is a way to prevent further intrusion. Trust is important, but mutual respect for each other's boundaries is also crucial. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It seems like he's trying to set a boundary that he feels is necessary for his comfort. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that trust is being compromised, but he's not hiding anything malicious; he's just protecting his past and personal data. \n\nTherefore, I think he's not in the wrong. Changing passwords to maintain privacy isn't inherently wrong, especially if the other person is overstepping by accessing personal information without permission. The problem might be more about how they communicate their boundaries and expectations regarding privacy and trust.\n"
