I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. They moved in together, and she wanted shared access for trust. He agreed to give her his password but now wants privacy after she found old stuff and snooped.\n\nFirst, privacy vs. trust. The user might feel that even though they're in a relationship, personal privacy is important. People have a right to their own devices and personal information, even in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions\u2014snooping through messages and apps\u2014might be overstepping, even if she had the password. Finding past content isn't the user's fault, but the invasion of privacy is the issue here.\n\nThe user changed passwords to regain control over their privacy. That's a common response when someone feels their boundaries are being crossed. The girlfriend's expectation of shared access might be reasonable, but if it's causing discomfort, there's a need for compromise. The key is whether the user's action is justified. Since the girlfriend was invading privacy by going through messages, the user's response to set boundaries is valid. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). They're protecting their privacy, which is reasonable in a relationship where mutual respect should exist.\n"
