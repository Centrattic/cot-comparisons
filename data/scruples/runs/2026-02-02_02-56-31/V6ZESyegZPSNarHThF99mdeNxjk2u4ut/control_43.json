I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nSo the situation is that the couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password, saying there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found some old stuff like browser history, Skype messages, pictures, and even went through his messages. The author now wants to change passwords to maintain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset about it, saying they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is setting boundaries for their privacy, which is a reasonable thing. Everyone has a right to some level of personal space, even in a relationship. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust, especially if she thought that mutual access was part of being in a relationship.\n\nBut the key points here are that the author didn't have access to the girlfriend's passwords, as they didn't ask for them. The author made it clear they didn't want to share, yet gave the password once. However, the girlfriend accessed private information without permission, which crossed a boundary. The author is now trying to reclaim their privacy, which is a justified reaction. The fact that the author is changing passwords to prevent further intrusion is a way to protect their personal space, which is reasonable. Trust is important, but it doesn't mean giving up all privacy. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
