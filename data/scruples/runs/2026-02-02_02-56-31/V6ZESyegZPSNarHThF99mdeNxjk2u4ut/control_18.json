I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her his password but now is changing them after she found some personal stuff. The girlfriend is upset because she feels this is a breach of trust, while the author wants some privacy.\n\nSo, the main issue is about privacy versus trust. The author is asserting their right to privacy by changing passwords, but the girlfriend feels that sharing passwords was a mutual agreement. The author's reasoning is that even though there's nothing to hide, the past stuff is embarrassing and they don't want to be embarrassed. The girlfriend is upset because she feels the trust is being broken.\n\nI need to consider both sides. In relationships, trust is crucial, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and apps without permission might be the root issue here. The author might feel that their privacy is being invaded, hence changing the passwords as a self-protective measure.\n\nBut the girlfriend might argue that sharing passwords was a mutual agreement, so changing them breaks that trust. However, the author might not have considered that giving a password can't be revoked without causing conflict. There's also the aspect of consent: the author didn't ask for her password, but she tried to get his. The imbalance here could be why the author is reacting.\n\nLooking at similar AITA scenarios, usually, people are advised to communicate and set boundaries. The author's action could be seen as a way to protect their privacy after feeling invaded. The girlfriend's actions of snooping might be the real issue here. The author changing passwords could be a reasonable response to prevent further intrusions.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting boundaries to protect their privacy. The girlfriend's initial overstepping might have justified the author's response. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
