I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. \n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password but now changed it because the girlfriend went through his stuff, found old things, and it's embarrassing. The author wants privacy, so they're changing passwords again.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think. Sharing passwords can be a personal choice. The author gave the password once but now feels privacy is important. The girlfriend is upset because she feels they should trust each other. But the author's actions are about setting boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, trust is key, but so is personal privacy. Just because someone moves in together doesn't mean they have to give up all privacy. It's reasonable for the author to want some space. The girlfriend might see it as a lack of trust, but the author is justified in wanting to keep personal stuff private, especially old messages and photos that aren't relevant now.\n\nThe fact that the girlfriend went through his phone and found things that were embarrassing shows she might not respect his privacy. So the author changing the passwords is a way to protect their privacy. That seems fair. So the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries.\n"
