I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend wanting access to the author's devices and accounts, citing trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after she found old, personal stuff and went through his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. Even in a relationship, individuals generally have the right to privacy. The author might feel that their personal data, like old conversations or photos, shouldn't be accessible without consent. The girlfriend's actions of searching through his devices without permission could be seen as a boundary violation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might argue that sharing passwords is a sign of trust. But trust shouldn't require complete transparency in every aspect. People have pasts and personal history that they might not want shared. The fact that she found things from 2013 and an old ex via Skype might not be relevant now, but they were still private.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect for boundaries. The author made it clear he didn't want her passwords, yet she expected the same. When he changed his, he was asserting his own privacy, which is a valid right. The girlfriend's reaction of being upset might stem from feeling excluded, but that doesn't invalidate the author's need for privacy.\n\nAlso, walking in on her going through his messages is a clear invasion of privacy. The author has every right to feel uncomfortable and take steps to prevent that. Changing passwords is a reasonable measure to maintain personal space.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
