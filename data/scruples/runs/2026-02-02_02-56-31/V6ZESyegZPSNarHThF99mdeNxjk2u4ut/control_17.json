I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is at fault for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post, so the user is looking for an analysis of whether the person is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person and their girlfriend moved in together. She wanted to share passwords as a show of trust. The person agreed to give her their password, but now she's going through their private data\u2014old browser history, Skype chats with an ex, old photos from a packed-away phone, and checking messages when they're not around. The person is changing the passwords to regain privacy, which upsets the girlfriend. She argues that trust means sharing access, but the person feels entitled to some privacy.\n\nNow, the key points here. The person initially shared the password, which was a gesture of trust. However, the girlfriend is invading the person's privacy by looking through things without permission. Even if there's nothing to hide, the act of prying into past private data without consent is a privacy violation. The person is now setting boundaries by changing passwords to protect their privacy. \n\nIn relationships, trust and privacy are both important. Trust involves not prying into each other's affairs without permission. Privacy is about having personal space and control over one's personal data. The girlfriend is violating the person's privacy by accessing their devices without consent. The person changing passwords is asserting their right to privacy, which is a reasonable action. \n\nBut there's a nuance. The person did share the password, so the girlfriend might feel justified in using it. However, the person's discomfort with her actions shows that sharing passwords isn't a perfect solution. The girlfriend's behavior crosses a line by going through private data without asking. The person is not in the wrong for setting boundaries here. They have the right to control access to their personal information, even in a relationship. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the person should have communicated their discomfort earlier. But the girlfriend's actions are the main issue here. The person is responding to her overstepping, which is a valid reaction. The answer is likely B (No, the person isn't in the wrong) because maintaining personal privacy is a reasonable request, and the girlfriend's actions were the problem.\n"
