I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend has asked to share passwords as a gesture of trust. The author initially gave her the password, explaining that they have nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found some old, potentially embarrassing items like porn in the browser history, old conversations with an ex, and photos of girls from an old phone. The author is now changing the passwords to maintain privacy, which upset the girlfriend who argues about trust.\n\nSo, the core issue is about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author isn't hiding anything nefarious, just old stuff that's not relevant now. The girlfriend's actions of going through the author's messages and apps could be seen as invasive. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend's behavior might be overstepping, especially if she's prying into past content without a good reason. The author is setting a boundary to protect their privacy, which is reasonable. However, the girlfriend might feel that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't hiding anything new or harmful, just old stuff that's not relevant. The girlfriend's actions are invasive, and the author has the right to set boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong for changing the passwords. They're asserting their right to privacy, which is important even in a trusting relationship. The girlfriend might need to respect that boundary, even if it's uncomfortable for her. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
