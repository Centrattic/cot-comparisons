I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend went through their stuff.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together, she wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. He gave her his password because he had nothing to hide. But she started looking through his old stuff\u2014porn history, old messages with an ex, pictures on an old phone, and even his phone messages. He feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so he changes his passwords. She's upset, saying it's about trust.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's at fault. Let me break it down. The key points are trust, privacy, and mutual respect. \n\nHe gave her his password initially, which might imply trust. But she's using that access to invade his privacy. Even if he has nothing to hide, the act of going through old, irrelevant stuff can be intrusive. People have a right to some personal space, even in relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, he did agree to share the password. But maybe that was before he realized how she would use it. The fact that she's checking his phone when he's not around suggests a lack of respect for his privacy. \n\nHe's changing passwords to reclaim his privacy. It's his computer and phone, so he should have the right to control access. The girlfriend's reaction might be about control or insecurity. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but it doesn't mean giving up all privacy. Healthy relationships should balance both. If she's not respecting his boundaries after he set them, that's an issue. \n\nSo, he's not in the wrong for wanting privacy. He's taking a stand to protect his personal space. The answer should be B (No).\n"
