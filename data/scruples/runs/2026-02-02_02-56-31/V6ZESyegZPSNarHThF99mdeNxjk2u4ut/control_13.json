I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The situation is that they moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password but then changed them after she started going through his stuff, finding old conversations, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend wanted shared access, which is common in some relationships as a gesture of trust. But the author felt privacy is important and changed the passwords. The key points here are consent and mutual respect.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend was upset because she expected trust. She might feel that changing passwords is a sign of distrust. On the other hand, the author has a right to privacy. The fact that she went through his messages without permission might justify his need for boundaries. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as setting boundaries to protect personal space. Even though they live together, that doesn't mean all personal devices should be accessible. The girlfriend's behavior of snooping without permission is the real issue here. The author is responding to that by taking back control of his privacy. \n\nHowever, communication is key. If the author didn't address her snooping before changing passwords, maybe he should have discussed it. But given that he tried to communicate his concerns and she didn't respect that, changing passwords is a reasonable step to protect his privacy. \n\nIn many relationships, trust is important, but it shouldn't come at the cost of one person's privacy. The girlfriend's actions were invasive, so the author's response is a way to set a boundary. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
