I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The situation is that when they moved in together, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. He gave her his password because he didn't have anything to hide, but she ended up finding old stuff like browser history, old messages, and photos. Now he's changing the passwords again to maintain some privacy, and she's upset about it, saying they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The user initially shared the password, maybe feeling that transparency is important in the relationship. But then he realized that sharing access led to him feeling embarrassed and invaded by her going through his private data. He's trying to set boundaries by changing passwords, which is about personal privacy. The girlfriend's reaction is that there's no reason to do so because trust should exist between them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. On one hand, trust and transparency are important in a relationship. If both parties agreed to share passwords, then changing them without discussion might seem like a breach of trust. On the other hand, privacy is a fundamental right, and even in relationships, individuals might want some level of personal space. The user felt that his privacy was being invaded when she went through his messages and found old stuff. The fact that he's not hiding anything but still finds it embarrassing shows that the invasion of privacy is the issue, not the content itself.\n\nThe girlfriend's expectation of access might be based on a different understanding of trust, where mutual access is a sign of openness. However, the user's need to protect his personal space is also valid. The problem here is that the initial agreement to share passwords might have been based on a misunderstanding. The user didn't want her password, but he gave her his, possibly expecting the same level of trust from her, but she didn't reciprocate by respecting his privacy.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the user had discussed his boundaries earlier, maybe they could have found a middle ground. However, since she was already going through his things without his consent, changing the passwords is a reasonable step to prevent further invasion. The fact that he's not hiding anything but still wants privacy suggests that the issue is about personal boundaries, not deceit.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy after experiencing discomfort from her actions. The answer should be B.\n"
