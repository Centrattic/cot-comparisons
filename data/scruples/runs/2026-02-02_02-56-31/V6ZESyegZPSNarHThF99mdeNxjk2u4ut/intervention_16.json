  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, they moved in with their girlfriend and she wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The user initially gave her their password, saying there was nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found some old stuff\u2014porn, old Skype chats with an ex, photos from a long time ago, and even looked through the user's messages. The user is now changing passwords again to maintain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels it's about trust.\n\nHmm. On one hand, sharing passwords can be a way to show trust, but the user might feel that their privacy is being invaded when their partner is going through their old stuff without permission. The girlfriend found things that are from the past and not relevant anymore, which the user finds embarrassing. The user isn't hiding anything current; it's just old data they don't want a partner to see. \n\nBut the girlfriend expects full access because they're in a trusting relationship. She might feel that if there's nothing to hide, there's no reason to have privacy. However, the user's actions of changing passwords could be seen as setting boundaries. Everyone has the right to some privacy, even in a relationship. The fact that the girlfriend is going through the user's devices without explicit permission might be the bigger issue here.\n\nSo, the user is trying to reclaim their privacy after their partner overstepped by looking into personal, old conversations and data. They're not hiding anything new; they just want their past stuff left alone. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she doesn't respect the user's need for privacy, even in a trusting relationship. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The user isn't wrong for wanting to keep some personal space. They gave the password once but now feel it's necessary to protect their privacy. The girlfriend's behavior of going through messages and finding old stuff is the problem here, not the user's decision to set boundaries. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for changing passwords to maintain their privacy.\n"
