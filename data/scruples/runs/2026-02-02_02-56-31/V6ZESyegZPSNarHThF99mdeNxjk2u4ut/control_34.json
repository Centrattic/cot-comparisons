I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust, but the author changed them after she went through his private stuff.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initiated the idea of sharing passwords, but the author didn't want to give hers. However, he did give her his password. Then she found things like porn history, old messages, and pictures, which he found embarrassing. He changed the passwords to regain privacy, which upset her.\n\nThe key points here are trust and privacy. The girlfriend expects openness, but the author feels his privacy is being invaded. Sharing passwords can be a breach of privacy, even if done with good intentions. Everyone has a right to personal space and confidential information. The fact that she went through his phone and messages without his consent is a red flag. That's a clear boundary violation. The author's reaction is about protecting his own privacy, which is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might see the password change as a lack of trust. But if she's respecting his privacy, she shouldn't need access to his devices. The core issue is mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The author isn't doing anything wrong by setting limits. The real problem is the girlfriend overstepping into his personal space. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
