  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for changing their passwords. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user and their girlfriend moved in together. She wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The user gave her the password because they had nothing to hide but now she's been going through his stuff, finding old stuff like browser history, old messages, and even looking at his phone. He's embarrassed and wants privacy, so he's changing the passwords again. She's upset because she feels they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me think. First, sharing passwords is a personal choice. The girlfriend wanted to share, but the user is setting boundaries now. It's about privacy. Even if there's nothing to hide, some people value their personal space. The girlfriend is invading his privacy by looking through his devices without permission. So when he changes the passwords, he's trying to protect his privacy. \n\nBut she argues that trust is important. However, trust doesn't mean you have to give up your privacy. Healthy relationships should respect each other's boundaries. If she's going through his things without asking, that's a problem. The user is reacting to her actions by setting limits. \n\nSo maybe he's not in the wrong. He's trying to maintain his privacy after she crossed a line. He didn't do anything wrong by changing the passwords. The issue is that she didn't respect his privacy. \n\nBut some might say that once you share passwords, changing them could be seen as a betrayal of trust. However, in this case, he gave her the password expecting mutual respect. Since she didn't respect it by invading his privacy, his response is justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
