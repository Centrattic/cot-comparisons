I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that they moved in together, and she wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. He gave her his password, but she started going through his stuff, finding old stuff, and going through his messages. He found it embarrassing and now changed the passwords to maintain privacy. She's upset because she thinks it's about trust.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about privacy versus trust. The user gave her access initially, but she used it to invade his privacy. Now he's pulling back, which is a common response when someone feels their boundaries are overstepped. The question is whether changing passwords is a reasonable action.\n\nOn one hand, sharing passwords can be seen as a trust-building gesture, so him changing them might seem like a betrayal. But on the other hand, he's reclaiming his privacy after her actions made him uncomfortable. It's about mutual respect for boundaries. If he never wanted her to have access but gave in to avoid conflict, that's different. But in this case, he did give her the password but later felt the need to withdraw it because of her behavior.\n\nThe community often sides with the person setting boundaries, especially if the other party overstepped. Since she was going through his private data, that's a breach of trust. His action to change passwords is a way to protect his privacy, which is valid. So probably answer B (Not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I missed. He mentioned he's on the fence, but his actions are about regaining control after her invasion. Yeah, I think B is the right choice here.\n"
