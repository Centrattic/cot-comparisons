I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust. The guy gave her his password because he didn't have anything to hide. However, she started going through his private stuff\u2014porn in browser history, old Skype chats with an ex, pictures of girls on an old phone, and even checking his messages. He's now changing the passwords again to maintain privacy, and she's upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the key points here are about privacy versus trust. The guy is setting boundaries to protect his personal information, which he feels is necessary even though there's nothing to hide. The girlfriend feels that not sharing access is a breach of trust. \n\nIn relationships, privacy is a big topic. People have different expectations. The guy might be right in asserting his right to privacy, especially since she's invading it by accessing his devices without permission. Even if there's nothing to hide, privacy isn't just about hiding things but about personal space and autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that sharing passwords is a way to show commitment and transparency. But if she's using that access to go through his private stuff, that's a problem. The issue here isn't just about the passwords but about her actions after having access. \n\nThe guy's decision to change passwords again could be seen as a reasonable step to protect his privacy once he realizes she's overstepping. It's not about hiding things but about respecting his boundaries. In healthy relationships, mutual respect for each other's privacy is important, even as trust is built. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to maintain his privacy when it's being invaded. The real issue might be the girlfriend's behavior of accessing his private data without his consent. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
