  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user moved in with his girlfriend and initially gave her his passwords to show trust. Now he's changing them because she's going through his stuff, making him uncomfortable. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, boundaries in relationships are important. Trust is key, but that shouldn't mean giving up all privacy. The girlfriend is prying into past stuff that's not relevant now. The user isn't hiding anything but feels his privacy is invaded. Changing passwords to protect his own privacy seems reasonable. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords shows trust. But if she's invading his privacy despite him giving her access, maybe she's overstepping. The user isn't doing anything wrong by setting boundaries. It's a balance between trust and privacy. I think the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
