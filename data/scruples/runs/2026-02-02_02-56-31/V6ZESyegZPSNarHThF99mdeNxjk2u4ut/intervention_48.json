  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. They moved in together, and she wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. He initially gave her the password because he had nothing to hide. But then she went through his stuff, found old stuff, and he felt his privacy was invaded. Now he's changing passwords again.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The user is trying to maintain some personal space, while the girlfriend feels that by sharing passwords, they're showing trust. But the fact that she accessed his stuff without permission is a problem. Even if he had nothing to hide, the invasion of privacy made him uncomfortable. \n\nI think the user's right to have some privacy is valid. Even in a relationship, people have the right to personal space. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and apps without consent are the real issue here. He's not doing anything wrong by setting boundaries. So, changing passwords to prevent unwanted access isn't him being in the wrong. The problem lies with her actions, not his response to protect his privacy. So, answer B.\n"
