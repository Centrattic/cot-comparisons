I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but then changed it after discovering that the girlfriend was going through his personal data\u2014like old messages, photos, and browser history. The author felt it was about privacy and that even though there's nothing to hide, the invasion of privacy was an issue. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust is important.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust vs. privacy. The author is trying to set boundaries to maintain their privacy after experiencing what they perceive as overstepping by the girlfriend. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees sharing passwords as a mutual trust act and is hurt that the author is now restricting access.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is individual privacy. It's possible that the girlfriend expected full transparency, but the author might have different comfort levels. The author's actions are about reclaiming their personal space after feeling their privacy was violated. The girlfriend's behavior\u2014going through messages and old devices\u2014might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if done out of curiosity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for setting these boundaries. Legally and ethically, people have the right to their privacy. Even in a relationship, individuals often maintain personal devices with private information. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're just uncomfortable with their past being scrutinized. The girlfriend's actions might not be malicious, but they do infringe on the author's sense of privacy.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for changing the passwords to protect their privacy. They have the right to set limits on how much access their partner has to their personal devices, especially after experiencing what they consider an invasion of their privacy.\n"
