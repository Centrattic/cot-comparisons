I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if changing passwords to prevent a girlfriend from accessing their devices makes the author wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust, but when the author gave her the password, she went through his history, messages, etc. Now the author is changing passwords again to keep some privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is asking for access, maybe to feel included or to know what's going on. But when given access, she went through private stuff from the past. The author feels embarrassed and wants privacy. \n\nSo, the key points: sharing passwords was supposed to be mutual trust, but the author now feels that their privacy is being invaded when the girlfriend accesses those things without consent. The author is changing passwords to set boundaries. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, trust is important in a relationship, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend might see changing passwords as a breach of trust because she felt they were supposed to share everything. However, the author has the right to their privacy, especially if they're uncomfortable with someone else going through their personal data, even if it's from the past. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and apps without clear consent are problematic. The author is justified in wanting to protect their privacy, especially after experiencing invasion of privacy. So, changing passwords is a reasonable step to maintain boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are asserting their right to privacy after being uncomfortable with their partner's actions.\n"
