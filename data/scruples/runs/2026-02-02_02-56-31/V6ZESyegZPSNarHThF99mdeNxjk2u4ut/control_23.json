I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The key points here are about privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password but then changed it after the girlfriend went through his personal stuff. The author's main issue is that their privacy was invaded, leading to embarrassment from old conversations and photos being found. \n\nIn relationships, mutual trust is crucial. However, respecting each other's privacy is also important. The author didn't hide anything malicious; they just wanted to keep personal items private. The girlfriend's actions of checking messages and apps without consent could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nChanging passwords to regain privacy isn't inherently wrong. Everyone has a right to personal space. The author's actions were a response to feeling their boundaries were crossed. The problem might stem from differing expectations: the girlfriend saw password sharing as a trust-building measure, while the author needed to maintain some level of privacy. \n\nIt's a balance between openness and respecting boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything, just protecting personal data. The girlfriend's upset reaction might be due to feeling rejected or not trusted, but the author's right to privacy shouldn't be overlooked. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're asserting their right to privacy after their boundaries were crossed.\n"
