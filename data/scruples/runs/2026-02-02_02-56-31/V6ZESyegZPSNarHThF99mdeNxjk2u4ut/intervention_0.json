I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices anymore. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a trust thing. The user gave her the password, saying there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend started looking through his stuff, finding old stuff like porn history, old Skype chats, pictures from an old phone, and even caught her going through his messages. He changed passwords to have some privacy, and she's upset, saying it's about trust.\n\nNow, the user is conflicted. They don't care about her looking but find it embarrassing. He's wondering if he did the right thing by changing passwords.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy vs. trust in a relationship. The user gave her the password, but she's invading his privacy. The user is trying to set boundaries. In relationships, while trust is important, mutual respect for privacy is also crucial. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping, even if she feels she's entitled to access. The user is not wrong for wanting to protect his personal space. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Communication is key here. The user might need to explain that while they're open, they need some privacy. But the act of changing passwords isn't necessarily wrong if the other person is infringing on that privacy. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong."
