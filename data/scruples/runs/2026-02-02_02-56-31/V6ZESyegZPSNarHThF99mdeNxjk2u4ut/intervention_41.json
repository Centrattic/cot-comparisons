  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. They moved in together, and she wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. He gave her his password, but she ended up going through his private stuff from the past. Now he's changing the passwords again to have some privacy, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, the key points here are trust and boundaries. The girlfriend is pushing for transparency, while the user feels his privacy is being invaded. The user's actions are about setting personal boundaries. Even though they're in a relationship, everyone has a right to some privacy. The girlfriend's behavior\u2014looking through messages, browser history, etc.\u2014could be seen as overstepping, even if she's doing it out of curiosity or concern.\n\nThe user isn't hiding anything; he's just trying to reclaim his privacy. The fact that she's upset about him changing passwords might indicate she feels betrayed, but he's justified in wanting to keep certain things private. Trust is important, but mutual respect for personal space is equally crucial. So, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
