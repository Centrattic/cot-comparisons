  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The user gave her the password because they thought there's nothing to hide, but then the girlfriend started going through their stuff, finding old stuff like browser history, old messages, pictures, and even checking their phone when they weren't around. The user is now changing the passwords to maintain some privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nSo the question is, is the user in the wrong for changing their passwords? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in a relationship. Trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The user gave the password initially, but maybe they didn't anticipate how the girlfriend would use it. The girlfriend's actions\u2014going through old messages, checking the phone when the user wasn't around\u2014seem intrusive. The user feels embarrassed and wants privacy. \n\nIn many relationships, people have different comfort levels regarding privacy. Some might share devices and passwords, others might not. The key here is that the user has the right to their own privacy, even in a relationship. The fact that the girlfriend is using the shared passwords to invade the user's privacy might justify the user setting boundaries. \n\nThe user isn't hiding anything malicious; the issues found are old and irrelevant (ex, old messages). The user is not in the wrong for wanting to protect their personal space. The girlfriend's actions are the problem here. The user is taking steps to prevent further intrusion, which is reasonable. So the answer is probably B (they are not in the wrong). \n\nBut wait, maybe there's another angle. The user agreed to share the password initially, so changing it could be seen as breaking trust. But if the other person is misusing the access, the user has the right to revoke it. It's about mutual respect. The user isn't hiding anything but needs privacy, so changing the password is a reasonable action. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
