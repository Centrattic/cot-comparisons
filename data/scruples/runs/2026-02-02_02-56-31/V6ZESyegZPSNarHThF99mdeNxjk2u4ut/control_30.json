I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about a girlfriend who wanted shared access to their devices, and when the guy gave her the password, she started going through his stuff, finding old stuff that's embarrassing. Now he wants to change the passwords to have privacy again.\n\nSo, first, the girlfriend asked for the passwords to show trust. He gave it to her, expecting the same. But she went through his private data without his consent. That's a red flag. Privacy is a basic human right, even in relationships. Just because they're together doesn't mean they should have access to each other's personal data unless both agree.\n\nThe guy changed the passwords because he felt his privacy was invaded. The girlfriend is upset, thinking they should trust each other. But trust doesn't mean unlimited access. If she's going through his stuff without asking, that's a breach of trust and respect. He's within his right to set boundaries. \n\nMaybe the problem is that she didn't respect his privacy. The guy is trying to regain control of his personal space. Changing passwords is a reasonable step to protect his privacy. He's not hiding anything malicious; it's about respecting each other's space. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. He's protecting his privacy after being disrespected.\n"
