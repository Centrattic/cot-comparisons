  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for changing my passwords so my girlfriend can\u2019t have access to my computer/phone?\nMy girlfriend and I recently moved in together, and she has brought up a couple times about sharing passwords to phones/ and computers to kinda show our trust in each other. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend went through their stuff. So the situation is that they moved in together, and she wanted shared passwords to show trust. He gave her his password because he thought there was nothing to hide. But then she found some personal stuff from the past, like old conversations, pictures, etc. He felt embarrassed and now wants to change his passwords to have privacy. She's upset because she thinks they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about trust and boundaries. He's trying to protect his privacy, which is reasonable. Everyone has the right to some level of personal privacy, even in a relationship. On the other hand, she's coming from a place of wanting to share and trust. But when she went through his messages and found those things, maybe she overstepped. \n\nChanging passwords to regain privacy isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's about setting boundaries. If he's uncomfortable with her having access, especially after she's invaded his privacy, then changing passwords is a way to protect himself. The fact that he's given her his passwords before but now is pulling back might be a reaction to her actions. \n\nBut maybe she feels hurt because he's withholding passwords now. However, his right to privacy isn't wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong. I think the answer here is B, he's not in the wrong. He's setting boundaries in response to her invading his privacy. It's about mutual respect. If she respects his privacy, then she shouldn't be upset when he sets his own boundaries. It's a two-way street. So the answer is B.\n"
