Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home to go to a wedding on time. The situation involves time management issues. The user, let's call him John, set a 3:45 PM deadline to leave by 4:15 PM for a 4:30 PM wedding. Jill didn't get ready in time, and he left her.\n\nFirst, John gave a heads-up about the time. He mentioned the deadline, and Jill said she'd be fine. That's important because he did warn her. But then she didn't get ready on time. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her. Now she's upset, feeling he was impatient and maybe lied about the laundry.\n\nIs John at fault? Well, he tried to manage the time, gave a clear deadline, and when she didn't meet it, he chose to leave rather than be late. But he did raise his voice, which isn't great. He could have handled the frustration differently. However, the main issue is that he left her behind. Did he consider alternatives? Like, maybe waiting a bit longer, or calling someone else for help? But he thought she knew the time and it was her responsibility. On the other hand, maybe he should have been more understanding, considering past patterns, but he was trying to respect the event's start time. \n\nSo, the key points: clear communication from John, Jill's known time issues, his frustration leading to yelling, and leaving her. Whether he's in the wrong depends on how he handled the situation. Leaving might have been necessary for punctuality, but the yelling and not offering help could be his fault. But since he left her, maybe he's not entirely wrong. The answer might be B (No) because he communicated the time and tried to be on time, but the yelling is a problem. However, leaving without ensuring she could get there might mean partial fault. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A because he yelled and left her, even if she was responsible for her time. Or B because he followed his plan. The community might split, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer could be A because he raised his voice and left her, even if she was late. So, AITA might lean towards A.\n"
