Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home when they were running late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the background: The user, let's call them Alex, mentions that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, often has trouble with time management. They had a conversation earlier in the day about getting ready for the wedding. Alex set a strict time limit, 3:45 PM, to leave at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 hit, she wasn't ready. Alex got frustrated, raised their voice, and left to get to the wedding on time. Now, Jill is upset because Alex was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled.\n\nSo, the question is, who is at fault here?\n\nLet me break down the key points. Alex tried to set a clear deadline and communicated it in advance. Jill didn't meet that deadline, so Alex left. Jill argues that Alex was impatient and mean. But Alex left her at home, which might have left Jill embarrassed or inconvenienced, but they were supposed to attend the wedding on time. \n\nFrom Alex's perspective, they were trying to be respectful to the wedding guests by showing up on time. They had given Jill a heads-up about the time needed. Jill didn't manage her time properly, so Alex made a choice to go without her to avoid being late. \n\nOn the other hand, Alex raised their voice, which Jill found mean. Even if it was frustration, yelling isn't a great way to handle it. Also, by leaving Jill behind, even if it's a choice to be on time, it might have left her in a bad position. Maybe Jill didn't expect to be left alone, and Alex didn't account for the fact that she might still be in a vulnerable state (naked as mentioned). \n\nBut considering that Alex had warned Jill multiple times and set a clear deadline, it's possible that Alex's actions were a result of frustration from repeated issues. However, leaving someone behind at home might not be the best solution. Perhaps a better approach would have been to wait a bit longer, but Alex felt it was necessary to leave to not be late. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe Alex didn't account for the fact that Jill's clothes were slightly damp, which they had mentioned might happen. So they knew there was a risk, but still left. \n\nIn terms of communication, Alex did their part by setting expectations. Jill didn't meet those expectations. But Alex's reaction (yelling and leaving) could be seen as harsh. However, considering the importance of punctuality and respecting others' time, maybe there's a balance. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. Alex might not be entirely in the wrong for trying to be on time, but the way they handled it (yelling and leaving Jill behind) could be problematic. However, the user is asking if they are in the wrong. In relationship dynamics, both parties might have some responsibility. But given the options, AITA usually leans towards whether the action taken was wrong. \n\nLeaving someone because they didn't meet a deadline you set is a bit of a personal choice, but it's not inherently wrong if the deadline was clear. However, yelling and leaving might have been an overreaction. So maybe A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think in this case, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong) because Alex did communicate the time, and Jill didn't meet it. However, the yelling adds a layer. But since the main question is about leaving her, maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps AITA would say A because leaving her home might not be considerate. Hmm. \n\nBut looking at similar AITA stories, if someone sets a time and the other person doesn't meet it, the person who left to be on time is often not in the wrong. The yelling is a separate issue. So maybe Alex is B (not in the wrong) for leaving, but could have handled the yelling better. So the answer might be B.\n"
