Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves both of them having different approaches to time management.\n\nFirst, their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't great with budgeting time. They often end up late because of that. The user values punctuality and sees lateness as rude. For the wedding, they set a clear time to leave at 3:45 PM. Jill said she'd be okay, but when the time came, she wasn't ready. The user got frustrated, yelled, and left at 4:00 PM. Now, Jill is upset because she feels he was impatient, didn't account for the laundry properly, and was mean when he yelled.\n\nSo, the user's actions: leaving her behind to avoid being late. Jill's reaction: feeling defensive because she knows she messed up. The user's reasoning is that he was trying to be respectful to the event's schedule, but his response (yelling and leaving) might have been harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the user tried to communicate clearly, set expectations, and gave a heads-up. On the other, when things went wrong, he reacted with frustration, raised his voice, and left without checking in again. Leaving her alone might have caused emotional distress, and yelling isn't ideal. However, the user might feel justified because the event was important and they both had agreed on a time.\n\nThe key points here are communication, emotional response, and consideration. Did he give her a chance to finish before leaving? He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the agreed time. Maybe that's reasonable, but 15 minutes might not be enough if she needed more time. Also, the laundry not being dry was his oversight, even though he thought it would be dry. That might contribute to the tension.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a mix. The user's frustration led to yelling and leaving, which isn't great. But Jill's repeated issues with time management are a problem too. However, the user's approach could have been more supportive. Maybe he could have tried to help her finish getting ready instead of leaving. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are key. Yelling and leaving can be hurtful. Even if the user's intention was to be punctual, the method might have been too harsh. So, there's a chance he's partially in the wrong for his reaction. But Jill's time management issues are a contributing factor. It's a shared responsibility situation, but the immediate action of leaving and yelling likely makes the user at least partially at fault. So, answer A (Yes) might be appropriate, but maybe there's nuance. However, since the question is whether the user is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, the answer could be A because the user's actions, while understandable, were not the best response. Alternatively, B if the user's intention was good. But given the yelling and leaving, I think A is more accurate here.\n"
