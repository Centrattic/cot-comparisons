Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user, who's a fianc\u00e9 to Jill, left her at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The main issue is about timing and communication. The user set a deadline of 3:45 to leave for the 4:30 wedding, but Jill wasn't ready by then. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her.\n\nFirst, the user had warned Jill about the time needed to leave. He even gave her a heads-up to start her tasks. Jill, on the other hand, said she'd be ready but didn't account for the laundry time properly. So, the user's frustration is understandable since they value punctuality. But raising his voice was a mistake. Yelling can be seen as disrespectful regardless of the situation. \n\nLeaving her at home might have been an overreaction. Even if Jill was late, taking the car and going alone without ensuring she gets there safely could be seen as abandoning her, which is inconsiderate. The user might have handled it better by staying and helping her finish or finding another way to make up for the time, rather than leaving her. \n\nJill's response is also valid. She's upset because she's a fianc\u00e9e and not used to being left in such a situation. The user's impatience and yelling contributed to her feeling disrespected. Even if she was at fault for not being ready, the user's actions escalated the situation. \n\nSo, the user made errors in both raising his voice and leaving her. The question is whether he's at fault. While Jill's time management is part of the problem, the user could have handled the situation more calmly and considerately. Therefore, he's partly at fault for the way he reacted, even if the initial issue was her being late.\n"
