Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: They had a wedding to attend 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill didn't get ready in time, her laundry wasn't dry, and she was still naked at 3:45. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, telling her he'd meet her there. Now Jill is upset, feeling he was impatient, didn't account for her laundry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author had given a clear timeline and warning. He's concerned about being on time, which he sees as respectful. Jill, on the other hand, has a history of poor time management. The author left because he didn't want to be late to the ceremony. But he raised his voice, which is a point of contention.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, leaving someone at home for a wedding seems extreme. Weddings are important events, and not showing up together could be hurtful. But the author's frustration comes from Jill's repeated lateness. However, even if she's at fault for not getting ready on time, the author's response\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might be seen as harsh. He could have tried to communicate better, maybe given her more time or found another way to handle the situation without yelling. But he did give her a heads-up and set the time frame. Maybe he was within his rights to prioritize punctuality, but the method could be questioned.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might be defensive because she's not used to the author pushing back. If this is a recurring issue, maybe the author is right to address it. But the act of leaving her alone, especially on such an important day, might be seen as inconsiderate. Also, the author's comment about the laundry being dry\u2014maybe he didn't account for possible delays earlier. He told her the clothes would be dry, but if the dryer wasn't on for enough time, that's his oversight.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: The author's frustration is understandable, but his actions (yelling and leaving) might be seen as overly harsh. However, Jill's repeated time management issues are part of the problem. The author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for criticism in how he handled it. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be a mix. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that he left her for the event and raised his voice, but also that he had given her warnings, it's a bit of a gray area. But maybe he's not in the wrong because he tried to be patient before. Hmm. Alternatively, leaving someone at home for a wedding is a big deal. I think the answer is A: Yes, the author is in the wrong. Even if Jill was late, walking out might be too much. Also, maybe he should have been more flexible or communicated differently. The yelling also adds to it. So, A.\n"
