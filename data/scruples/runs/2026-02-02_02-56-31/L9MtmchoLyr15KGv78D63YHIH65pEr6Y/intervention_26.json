Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding. They had discussed leaving at 3:45 to be on time for a 4:30 wedding. Jill didn't finish getting ready, so he left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user was concerned about being late and being disrespectful to others. They had given Jill a heads-up about the time, and she said she'd be ready. But she wasn't, so he left. He raised his voice in frustration but then left. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't account for the laundry not being dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and expectations. The user tried to set clear expectations, but Jill didn't meet them. However, raising his voice and leaving her alone might be seen as harsh. Leaving her naked and with damp clothes seems like a breach of trust and respect. Even if Jill is at fault for not managing her time, the user's response could be problematic. Yelling and leaving her might have been hurtful and dismissive of her situation.\n\nAlso, the user's reasoning that Jill knows she's in the wrong might not be valid. People often get defensive when they feel criticized. The user's actions might have escalated the conflict instead of addressing it calmly. Maybe a better approach was to stay and help her get ready or to communicate more effectively rather than leaving in frustration.\n\nIn relationships, how you handle conflicts matters. The user's frustration is understandable, but the method of responding could be seen as inconsiderate. So, while Jill's time management is an issue, the user's actions might still make them at fault for the way they handled the situation.\n"
