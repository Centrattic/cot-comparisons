Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and Jill had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, which is 30 minutes away. The author mentioned they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. The conversation happened around 1:30 PM, where the author reminded Jill to start preparing early to make sure her clothes are dry. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45 PM, she wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00 PM, saying he'd meet her there. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling. The author thinks she's being defensive because he believes she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are about time management and communication. Let's consider both perspectives.\n\nThe author tried to plan ahead by telling her to start early and set a strict departure time. He might have felt stressed because they often run late, and he doesn't want to be disrespectful by being late to the wedding. However, when the time came, Jill wasn't ready, and instead of working together to find a solution, he left her. His frustration led to yelling, which is a problem. \n\nOn Jill's side, she might not be great with time management, but she might have trusted the author's assessment that the laundry would dry in time, so she didn't start early. She could feel disrespected by being left alone, especially since she wasn't ready yet. The fact that her clothes were slightly damp suggests maybe the dryer wasn't done, so the author's earlier statement that \"probably\" they'd be dry by the time they leave might have led her to believe they would be. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the author's actions were justified. Leaving someone at home, even if they're late, can be seen as abandonment, which is hurtful. Yelling adds emotional harm. While the author had a valid concern about punctuality, his solution was to leave, which might have been an overreaction. He could have tried to help her get ready faster or compromise, like leaving slightly late if possible, instead of cutting her off. \n\nThe author's intention was to avoid being late, which is understandable, but the method of leaving her without support or communication might not be the best approach. The fact that this is a recurring issue (they \"have this convo a lot\") suggests a pattern, but that doesn't justify the immediate action of leaving her. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. The author might have handled the stress poorly, and his actions could be seen as selfish in this moment, even if his intention was to be respectful to the wedding guests. Jill's defensiveness could be a reaction to feeling blamed, which is common in such situations. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author made a mistake in his approach. He should have managed his frustration better and found a more supportive solution instead of leaving her. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
