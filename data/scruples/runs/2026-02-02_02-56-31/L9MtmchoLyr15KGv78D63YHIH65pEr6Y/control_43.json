Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding. The key points here are the communication between them and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the author set a clear deadline of leaving at 3:45 to arrive on time. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, said she'd be ready but wasn't. The author waited until 4:00, then left. They raised their voice in frustration, which is admitted as a wrongdoing. \n\nJill is upset because she feels the author was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and was mean. The author argues that Jill's time management is the issue here. \n\nNow, considering both sides. The author had a valid concern about punctuality, which is a common issue in relationships. However, raising their voice and leaving without informing Jill properly could be seen as harsh. Leaving someone at home, especially a partner, might cause emotional distress. The author's frustration is understandable, but the action of leaving might have been impulsive. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's repeated time management issues might contribute to the problem. But the author's solution of leaving could have been handled more gracefully. Communication is key here. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss the issue calmly and find a solution together instead of leaving abruptly. \n\nThe author did mention they wait until 4:00, which is 15 minutes after the deadline. However, the act of leaving might be seen as abandoning Jill in a difficult situation. The author's main mistake was not handling the frustration constructively and not ensuring Jill was aware they were leaving before actually doing so. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were wrong in terms of handling the situation, even if the underlying issue is Jill's time management. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
