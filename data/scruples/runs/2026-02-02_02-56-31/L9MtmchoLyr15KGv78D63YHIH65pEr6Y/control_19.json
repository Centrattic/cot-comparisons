Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves time management issues on the fianc\u00e9e's part and the author's frustration.\n\nFirst, the author gave a clear deadline: leave at 3:45. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, she wasn't ready. The author waited until 4:00 (15 minutes past the deadline) and then left. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author set a specific time and made it clear they wanted to be punctual, which is reasonable. However, raising their voice in frustration is a red flag. Yelling can be seen as disrespect, even if the person feels justified.\n\nJill's main complaints are that the author was impatient, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling. The author's counter is that Jill was in the wrong. But the author did tell Jill that the laundry's dryness was up to her. So maybe the expectation wasn't clear. However, the author still left after waiting 15 minutes, which shows some consideration, but the yelling and leaving her behind could be seen as harsh. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have handled the frustration differently, maybe by discussing the problem calmly instead of yelling. Leaving someone at home might be seen as abandoning them, even if the person was late. But the author's motivation was to be on time, which is understandable. However, the method (yelling and leaving) might be where the mistake lies. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author set a time but didn't follow through on helping Jill meet that time. They also raised their voice, which is not ideal. The fianc\u00e9e might have contributed to the problem, but the author's reaction could have been handled better. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility, especially for the yelling and the abrupt decision to leave. \n\nAnswer: A (the author is in the wrong)\n"
