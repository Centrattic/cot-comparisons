Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation step by step. The author, let's call him Will, had a plan to leave by 3:45 PM to get to the wedding on time. He gave a heads-up to his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, about the time they needed to leave. Jill, on the other hand, said she would be fine, but ended up not being ready by 3:45. At 4:00, Will left without her.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and the actions taken. Will had warned Jill about the time needed and even asked if she needed help with her clothes. Jill said she was okay, but didn't manage her time well. Will then got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. \n\nFrom Will's perspective, he was trying to be respectful to the event's schedule and didn't want to be late. But he also got upset and yelled at Jill, which is a negative behavior. However, considering that Jill had a history of poor time management and this wasn't an isolated incident, Will's frustration might be understandable.\n\nOn the other side, Jill is upset because Will yelled, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and left her. She might feel disrespected or that her needs weren't considered. But she did have prior warnings and didn't take them seriously. \n\nThe question is whether Will is in the wrong. He did leave her, which could be seen as abandoning her, but the alternative was being late to the wedding. However, he did raise his voice, which is a problem. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all factors, Will's actions were a reaction to Jill's repeated time management issues. He tried to communicate and give warnings. His mistake was losing his temper and yelling, but leaving her might have been to prevent being late. However, leaving her alone could also be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the main issue here is that the author left his fianc\u00e9e. Even if she was responsible for being late, the act of leaving her behind could be seen as abandoning her, especially when they were going to a shared event. However, the author's intention was to make the event on time. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal views on punctuality vs. supporting a partner. In some contexts, Will's action is understandable, but in others, leaving a partner is wrong regardless. \n\nGiven that, the author did make a mistake by yelling, but the act of leaving might be seen as a necessary option. However, since they were going as a couple, leaving her might not be the best choice. So, there's a mix. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn the end, while Will had valid reasons for frustration, the way he handled it\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014was not ideal. Therefore, the answer might lean towards Yes (A), but some might argue No (B). However, the act of leaving a partner in this situation could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the reason is punctuality. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
