Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The wedding is 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. They agreed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, didn't start her laundry on time, and her clothes were only slightly dry by 3:45. The author waited until 4:00 PM before leaving without her, which made her upset.\n\nThe author mentioned that they often have this issue where Jill is bad at time management. He raised his voice in frustration but then left. The key points here are communication, prior issues, and the actual action taken.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to set a clear deadline (3:45 PM) and gave a heads-up. Jill didn't adhere to that. The author felt it was important to be on time and couldn't wait longer. However, the fact that he raised his voice could be seen as harsh, even if it was frustration. Also, leaving without her might have been a reaction to a recurring problem, but it's possible he could have handled the situation differently, like waiting a bit longer or helping her get ready instead of leaving in a huff.\n\nBut then, considering that they had prior conversations about this, maybe the author's actions were a result of accumulated frustration. However, leaving a fianc\u00e9e at home for a public event could be seen as inconsiderate, even if she was late. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is understandable because being left alone at a wedding might cause her embarrassment or stress.\n\nThe author argues that Jill is being defensive, but the situation is a bit of a two-way problem. The author might have had good intentions to be on time, but the method of leaving without her could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if he didn't have a way to meet her at the venue. Also, the raised voice adds to the emotional impact on Jill.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both parties have some responsibility. The author set a time, Jill didn't meet it. But the way the author handled it (raising his voice and leaving) could be seen as the wrong approach. The question is whether the action of leaving was the appropriate response. Since they are engaged, communication and empathy are key. Leaving might be a valid decision given the time constraints, but the execution (yelling and abrupt departure) might make the author at fault.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the way he handled the situation, even if the initial problem was Jill's time management.\n"
