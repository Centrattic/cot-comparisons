Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author, let's call him Will, had warned Jill several hours in advance that they needed to leave by 3:45 to make it to the 4:30 wedding. He even mentioned the laundry situation and the timing. Jill said she'd be fine, but clearly didn't manage her time well. At 3:45, she wasn't ready, clothes were slightly damp, and he got frustrated. He waited until 4:00, yelled, and left her.\n\nNow, from Will's perspective, he's trying to be punctual and respectful to the wedding guests. He's stressed because this is a recurring issue. He feels like he's doing the right thing by not being late, so he takes action when he realizes they'll miss the event. He sees Jill as at fault for not being ready on time.\n\nBut from Jill's side, she might feel that Will didn't support her enough. She trusted him when he said the clothes would be dry, but they weren't, which added to her not being ready. Also, raising his voice and leaving her could be seen as harsh and abandoning her in a vulnerable state. She might feel hurt and unappreciated, especially since they're engaged and should be a team.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. Will set a clear deadline, but maybe he could have handled the situation differently. Instead of yelling and leaving, he could have tried to help her get ready, maybe offered to take her to the wedding once she was dressed, even if they arrived late. His frustration is understandable, but his actions might have been too extreme, especially considering her state (naked, not ready) and the emotional impact of being left alone.\n\nAlso, the fact that this is a recurring issue suggests that both might need to work on their communication and time management strategies together. However, in this specific instance, Will's decision to leave her could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, even if the root cause is Jill's time management. Yelling and abandoning someone in that situation is generally not considered appropriate, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, while Jill is responsible for her own time management, Will's response was probably over the top. He could have handled the stress without yelling and leaving her alone. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
