Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, which was 30 minutes away. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 came, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still not ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 to go to the wedding without her.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they prioritized punctuality and not being late for the wedding. They had a history of this issue with Jill's time management. They tried to set a clear deadline, but Jill didn't meet it. The author left to avoid being late, considering that walking in during the ceremony would be rude. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill is upset because she feels the author was impatient, didn't account for the laundry drying time properly, and yelled at her. She might feel that the author didn't trust her to manage her time, leading to stress and conflict.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author did set a clear deadline and gave a heads-up. However, leaving Jill alone when she wasn't ready might be seen as abandoning her in a stressful situation. The author's frustration is understandable, but raising their voice adds to the conflict. The key here is whether the action of leaving was the right response. \n\nThe author might have alternatives, like staying and helping Jill get ready or adjusting the timeline slightly if possible. But given the strict timing of a wedding, maybe there wasn't flexibility. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, Jill did promise she'd be ready by 3:45, but her estimation was off. The author's responsibility was to ensure they arrived on time. However, the way the author handled it\u2014leaving without her\u2014could be seen as harsh. \n\nIt's also important to note that in a close relationship, communication and support are key. Yelling might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The author might have been trying to prevent two bad outcomes: being late for the wedding and stressing over Jill's unmet deadline. But the method of leaving without her and the raised voice contributed to the conflict. \n\nSo, while Jill is at fault for not managing her time, the author's actions in leaving and yelling could be considered in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation calmly or supportively. The author might have been prioritizing punctuality over their partner's feelings in a moment of stress.\n"
