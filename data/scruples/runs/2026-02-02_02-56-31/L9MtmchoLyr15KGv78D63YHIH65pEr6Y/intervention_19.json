Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. The situation involves a wedding they were supposed to attend, and the fianc\u00e9e wasn't ready on time. The user gave a specific timeline and described the interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. The user set a clear deadline (3:45) to leave, but Jill wasn't ready by then. The user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure the laundry was dry, and yelled. The user thinks she's being defensive.\n\nSo, the main issues here are time management, communication, and the user's reaction. The user set a deadline, which is understandable to avoid being late. However, when the deadline was missed, the user chose to leave, which left Jill behind. The user also raised their voice in frustration, which can be seen as yelling, even if it was in a moment of stress. \n\nThe user's argument is that Jill knew the deadline and didn't meet it, so he's in the right for holding her accountable. On the other hand, leaving his fianc\u00e9e alone at home might not be considerate, especially if she was in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes slightly dry). The user's frustration might be justified, but the method of handling it\u2014leaving her and yelling\u2014could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the laundry part. The user mentioned the clothes might be dry by 3:45 but said it's up to Jill. If the clothes were damp when she got ready, maybe the user should have been more proactive in checking or helping to ensure they were dry. However, the user might not have realized the clothes weren't dry until it was too late.\n\nCommunication breakdown seems a key factor. Maybe the user could have handled the situation with more patience and support instead of frustration. Leaving Jill in that state might be seen as abandoning her, even if the intention was to be on time. The user's approach might have been too harsh, especially in a relationship where both parties should support each other.\n\nBut also, being late to a wedding is socially frowned upon, so the user's stress about punctuality is understandable. The question is whether the user's actions were reasonable given the situation. Did the user have to leave Jill behind, or could there have been another solution, like staying a bit longer or helping her get ready faster?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. Jill didn't meet the deadline, and the user didn't manage the situation calmly. However, the user's response of leaving and yelling might be more directly at fault here. The user's actions could have been seen as selfish, even if they were stressed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the user being partially at fault for the way they handled the situation, even if Jill's time management was an issue. The act of leaving a partner in a vulnerable state and raising one's voice are significant factors here.\n"
