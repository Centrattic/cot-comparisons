Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author set a time to leave at 3:45 to make the 4:30 wedding on time. They warned Jill earlier, around 1:30 PM, that they needed to leave by then. Jill said she'd be ready, but by 3:45, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, saying they'd meet there. Now Jill is upset, feeling he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author tried to plan ahead, gave a heads-up, and set a firm time. Jill didn't manage her time well, leading to lateness. But the author's response was to leave without her after a confrontation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were based on trying to be punctual and respecting the event's schedule. However, leaving without Jill might have been a harsh reaction, even if she was at fault. Raising their voice adds to the tension. On the other hand, Jill's lack of time management is a problem, but the author could have handled it differently, maybe by waiting a bit longer or discussing alternatives.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not be entirely at fault for prioritizing punctuality, but their reaction could have been more understanding. However, considering that they had a prior agreement and Jill was aware of the time constraints, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the act of leaving without her could be seen as abandoning her, even if she was responsible for the delay. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's response was proportional. Since they had warned her and she didn't meet the deadline, the author's decision to leave might be justified, but the yelling and abrupt departure could be seen as harsh. However, the main issue is the time management on Jill's part. The author tried to plan, but the conflict arises from how they handled the situation when it went wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the balance is between both parties. Here, Jill's failure to manage time is a problem, but the author's reaction also contributes. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the author left after giving a clear deadline and Jill didn't meet it, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the fact that the clothes were only slightly damp suggests maybe the dryer wasn't set right, so the author might have a point in assuming they'd be dry. But they didn't check or help, which could be another angle. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong since they tried to plan and set expectations. The answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. However, in typical AITA responses, if one person is at fault for poor planning but the other's reaction is also extreme, sometimes the one who acted out is still seen as partially wrong. But given the scenario, the author's actions were a response to Jill's consistent issues, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
