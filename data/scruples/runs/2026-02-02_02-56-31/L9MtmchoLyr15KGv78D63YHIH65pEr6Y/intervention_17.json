Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding because they were going to be late. They provided a detailed account of the situation.\n\nFirst, the key points: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. The user, let's call him John, planned to leave at 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding. Jill was still not ready at 4:00, so he left without her. He raised his voice in frustration. She's upset because he was impatient, didn't make sure her clothes were dry, and yelled. He thinks she's being defensive.\n\nSo, the question is whether John is in the wrong. To figure this out, I need to consider both sides. From John's perspective, he was trying to be on time, which he values, and he had given multiple warnings. He felt frustrated and left to avoid being late. From Jill's side, she might feel disrespected for being left and that John didn't support her in getting ready.\n\nI should consider communication. John gave a heads up about leaving at 3:45, but maybe he could have handled it more calmly. Yelling might have escalated the situation. However, leaving to avoid being late might be seen as responsible, but leaving her alone could be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the fact that he left her naked and not ready might be a red flag. Even if she's at fault for not managing time, he could have found another way to address the problem, like helping her get ready instead of just leaving. \n\nIn relationships, how partners handle stress is important. John's frustration might be valid, but the method of handling it (raising his voice, leaving) might not have been the best approach. Jill's reaction could stem from feeling unsupported and criticized.\n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe John is partially at fault for his reaction and the way he left her. But Jill is also responsible for not being ready. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he left her in a vulnerable state and escalated the conflict by yelling, it's likely he's at fault. So answer A.\n"
