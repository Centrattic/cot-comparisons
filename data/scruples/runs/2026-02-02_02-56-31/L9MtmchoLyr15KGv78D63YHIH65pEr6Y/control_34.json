Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late. The situation involves a wedding starting at 4:30, and they needed to leave by 3:45. The author had warned Jill about the time, she said she'd be ready, but ended up not being ready. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author points out that Jill isn't good with time management and they often end up late. He wanted to be punctual, which he considers respectful. But he ended up raising his voice and leaving her. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean.\n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author had given a clear deadline and a heads-up. Jill, on the other hand, didn't manage her time as required. However, the author's reaction\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might have been an overreaction. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready on time, the author's response could have been more constructive. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe he could have communicated better, like giving a gentle reminder or helping her get ready. \n\nLeaving her alone might have been a hasty decision. While punctuality is important, the method of handling the situation is crucial. Yelling and abandoning her could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the time constraints. Jill might feel that he didn't support her during a stressful situation, and his actions could have hurt her feelings. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the clothes were slightly damp, which he had warned her about. So, he might have contributed to the problem by not being more proactive in ensuring they were dry. Maybe he should have suggested a time when the laundry could be done to dry properly, instead of leaving it up to her. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill did agree to the time frame and didn't take it seriously. The author's impatience is a factor here, but it's a common issue in relationships where one person is more punctual than the other. However, the way he handled it\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might have been too harsh. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions (yelling and leaving) were inappropriate even if Jill was responsible for her own time management. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how he handled the situation, even if Jill's behavior was the root cause.\n"
