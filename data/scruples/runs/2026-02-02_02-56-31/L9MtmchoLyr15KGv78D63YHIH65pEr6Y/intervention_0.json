Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because she wasn't ready for a wedding they were supposed to attend. They wanted to leave by 3:45 to arrive on time, but by 4:00, Jill was still naked, her clothes were slightly damp, and he left. Now Jill is upset, saying he was impatient, didn't tell her the clothes would be dry, and yelled at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user is frustrated with the recurring issue of being late. They mentioned that Jill isn't good at budgeting time and they often cut it close. He had set a firm time to leave, but she didn't meet that. He raises his voice in frustration and leaves. On the other hand, Jill is upset about being left, feeling disrespected, and maybe feeling that he didn't support her enough, especially since she was preparing for a wedding.\n\nThe user argues that Jill is being defensive because she knows she's wrong. But maybe there's more to it. Did he give her enough time to prepare? He told her to start at 2:30, assuming two hours. But maybe she needed more time. The clothes being slightly damp might be an issue\u2014maybe he should have been more flexible or checked in more. Raising his voice is a problem regardless, as yelling is generally not okay in a relationship. Leaving her alone in that state could be seen as cruel, even if he's frustrated.\n\nBut he also wanted to be punctual and respectful to others. There's a balance between being considerate to the wedding guests and being supportive to his partner. Maybe there was a better way to handle the situation without leaving her. Perhaps he could have offered help or communicated more calmly instead of escalating to yelling and leaving.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault, both have some responsibility. Jill might have been better prepared, but the user's reaction (yelling and leaving her in an undressed state) is problematic. So maybe the user is in the wrong (A) because of the harsh reaction, even if the underlying issue is Jill's time management. Or maybe it's a shared responsibility, but the user made a poor choice in how to handle it, leading to AITA being No (B) because Jill's behavior is the main issue. Wait, the user is asking if they are in the wrong. If the user is wrong for yelling and leaving, then answer A. If they're justified because of Jill's behavior, answer B.\n\nBut in relationships, communication and respect are key. Yelling and leaving her naked might be considered inconsiderate regardless of the cause. So the user is in the wrong (A) for their reaction, even if the situation was frustrating. So the answer would be A.\n"
