Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e because she wasn't ready on time. The situation is about time management and communication issues.\n\nFirst, the user (let's call him Jack) set a clear deadline of 3:45 to leave for the wedding. He mentioned the time multiple times. Jill, his fianc\u00e9e, said she'd be fine but ended up not being ready. He got upset, raised his voice, and left alone. Now she's upset because he was impatient, didn't account for the laundry not drying, and was mean.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, Jack had a valid concern about being late, which would be disrespectful. He did set a time in advance. On the other hand, he raised his voice, which is unkind and could be seen as yelling. Also, he left her alone, which might have been stressful for her, especially since they were going to a wedding. Maybe he could have handled it differently, like staying to help or finding another solution instead of leaving.\n\nJill's responsibility is about not managing her time well, but Jack's reaction might have been too harsh. Leaving her home alone could be seen as abandoning her, even if she was unprepared. There might be communication issues here. Maybe he didn't check in more often or offer help instead of getting frustrated. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jack is blaming her for being in the wrong while she's defensive suggests there's a pattern here. If this happens often, it could indicate a deeper issue in their relationship about how they handle stress and time management. \n\nIn terms of accountability, both might share some. But the question is whether Jack is in the wrong. His actions (yelling, leaving her) could be seen as the issue here. Even if he was stressed, his response was reactive and not constructive. Instead of leaving, maybe he could have calmly addressed the situation, helped her get ready, or adjusted plans if possible. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that Jack is in the wrong (A) because his reaction was inappropriate, even if the situation was frustrating. However, some might argue that he's not in the wrong because Jill didn't manage her time. But the act of leaving her alone and raising his voice is problematic.\n"
