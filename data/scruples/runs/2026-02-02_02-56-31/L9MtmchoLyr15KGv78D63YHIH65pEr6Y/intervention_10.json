Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home when they were going to be late. The situation is a common one where Jill, the fianc\u00e9e, isn't managing her time well. The user, let's call him John, had warned her they needed to leave by 3:45 to be on time for the wedding starting at 4:30. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 hit, she wasn't ready, her clothes were still damp, and he got frustrated, yelled, then left her at home to go alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. John's intention was to be punctual and respectful to the wedding guests. He tried to communicate the time constraints in advance. But he raised his voice in frustration, which could be seen as yelling, which is unkind. Leaving Jill behind might have been a reaction to her not meeting the deadline, but did he give her enough time after 3:45? He waited till 4:00, which is an extra 15 minutes. However, the clothes were slightly damp, so maybe they wouldn't have been dry in time even if she started earlier. \n\nJill's responsibility here is time management. She might have underestimated the drying time or overestimated her ability to get ready quickly. But she's also his fianc\u00e9e, and they're a team. Maybe he should have handled the frustration differently. Yelling and leaving might have been impulsive. However, his goal was to be on time, which is understandable. \n\nBut leaving her behind could be seen as abandoning her in a stressful situation. Even if she's at fault for not being ready, the way he reacted might have been harsh. Communication is key here. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe he could have tried to help her prioritize or compromise. \n\nAlso, the fact that they have this conversation often suggests that this is a recurring issue, not a one-time mistake. John might not have addressed the root cause of her time management issues. Maybe they need a system or a different approach to handle such situations. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear yes or no. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The act of leaving her could be seen as a consequence of his frustration, but it's possible that he could have handled it better without yelling and without leaving. The key factors are communication, respect, and teamwork. Since they're engaged, maintaining a supportive relationship is important. So while Jill is responsible for her time management, John's reaction and decision to leave might have been harsh and could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, he might share some responsibility for the way he handled the situation, even if his intention was to be on time.\n"
