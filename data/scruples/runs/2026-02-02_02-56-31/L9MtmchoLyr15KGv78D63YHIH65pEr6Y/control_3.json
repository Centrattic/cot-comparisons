Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They often end up late, and the author finds it rude. The wedding is 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. The author tells Jill they need to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill says she'll be fine. But at 3:45, she's still not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and the author gets frustrated. They raise their voice, wait until 4:00, then leave without her.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're at fault. Let's look at both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to communicate the importance of leaving on time. They gave a heads-up about the departure time. Jill was aware of the schedule. She might have taken on more than she could handle with the laundry and getting ready. The author was concerned about being late, which they consider disrespectful. Their frustration led them to yell and then leave, which seems harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author left their fianc\u00e9e in a vulnerable state\u2014naked and not ready. That's not safe or considerate. Even if Jill was not managing her time well, the author could have handled the situation differently. Yelling and leaving might escalate the conflict instead of solving the problem. Also, leaving someone at home, especially in that condition, could be seen as abandonment or lack of support.\n\nThe key points here are communication and conflict resolution. The author had the intention to be punctual, which is understandable. But their actions\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014might have crossed a line. Jill's reaction about being defensive could be due to feeling unsupported or hurt by the author's actions. Even if Jill made mistakes with time, the author's response might not have been the best approach. There's a lack of empathy in the author's actions, focusing on their own stress rather than Jill's situation.\n\nConsidering societal norms and relationship dynamics, it's often expected that partners support each other through challenges. The author's decision to leave could be seen as prioritizing punctuality over their partner's well-being. However, Jill's consistent time management issues are also a factor. The root problem might be how they handle such situations together, not just one person's fault.\n\nIn summary, both parties have some responsibility. Jill didn't manage her time as agreed, and the author reacted in a way that was hurtful. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they chose to leave Jill in a compromising situation and raised their voice, which can be seen as emotional abuse in a relationship, it's likely the author is in the wrong. However, the situation is nuanced, and both sides contributed to the conflict.\n"
