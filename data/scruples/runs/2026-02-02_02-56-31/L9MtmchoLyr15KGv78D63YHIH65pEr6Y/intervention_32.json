Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, 30 minutes away. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, wasn't ready by 3:45 when they needed to leave. She was still getting ready, her clothes were slightly damp from the dryer, and the user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left her around 4:00 PM. Now Jill is upset, feeling the user is impatient, and that he broke his promise about the clothes drying.\n\nSo, the user is seeking advice on whether they were in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, they wanted to be punctual. They had warned Jill multiple times about the time constraints, set a clear deadline, and when she didn't meet it, they felt justified in leaving to avoid being late. They also mention that Jill tends to overestimate her time management, which has caused issues before. Their frustration led to raising their voice, but they left to avoid the event being disrupted.\n\nFrom Jill's perspective, she might feel that the user didn't account for the dryer time properly, leading to the clothes being damp. She could also feel that the user was impatient and didn't help her finish getting ready instead of just leaving. The fact that she was still getting dressed and not ready by the time he left might make her feel abandoned or that her needs weren't considered.\n\nKey points to consider: Communication. Did the user communicate effectively the time constraints? It seems like they did warn her multiple times. However, maybe the user didn't follow up or check in again closer to the deadline. Also, the user's reaction\u2014raising their voice\u2014could be seen as aggressive, even if they had a valid reason. Leaving might be seen as a solution, but the manner in which it was done (yelling, abrupt departure) could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: The user's responsibility in helping Jill meet the deadline. Maybe he could have assisted her instead of waiting and then leaving. Or perhaps they could have adjusted the plan, like leaving earlier, but he chose to follow the strict timeline. However, they were already at the latest possible departure time.\n\nThe user's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it (yelling) is a negative point. Leaving might have been necessary to attend the event on time, but the approach could have been more compassionate. Maybe a compromise could have been found, like rushing together instead of leaving her alone.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some blame. The user set a clear deadline, but Jill didn't meet it. However, the user's response (yelling and leaving) could be seen as harsh. The fact that they were going to a wedding, a formal event, adds pressure to be on time, but handling stress in a respectful manner is important in a relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the user might not be entirely in the wrong for trying to be punctual, but their method of handling the situation (yelling, abrupt departure) is problematic. However, the question is specifically about leaving her. If the user had a valid reason to leave to make the event on time, maybe they weren't in the wrong, but their behavior contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (No), but with the caveat that communication and approach could improve. However, since the user raised their voice and left abruptly, some might argue that A (Yes) is the answer because they could have handled it better. It's a bit of a gray area. In many such scenarios, leaving might be seen as not the main issue, but the way it was done is. So the user isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it more effectively.\n"
