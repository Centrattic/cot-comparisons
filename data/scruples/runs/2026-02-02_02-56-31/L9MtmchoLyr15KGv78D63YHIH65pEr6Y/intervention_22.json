Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: They had a wedding to attend 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. They discussed leaving by 3:45 at the latest. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, didn't get ready in time, and the person left at 4:00 to make it on time. They raised their voice in frustration, and now Jill is upset, feeling it's about the user's impatience and not taking responsibility.\n\nHmm. The user's main argument is that Jill isn't good with time management, they've had similar issues before, and they wanted to be punctual. They left because they didn't want to be late and were frustrated. They think Jill is in the wrong.\n\nBut let's think about both sides. On one hand, being punctual is important, especially at a wedding. Leaving early makes sense if they're going to miss it. However, the user raised their voice, which can be seen as yelling or being harsh, even if it's in frustration. Also, the user might have assumed responsibility by leaving without ensuring Jill could handle the situation. Maybe they should have stayed and helped, or communicated differently instead of escalating the situation with yelling.\n\nJill's perspective: She might feel disrespected and blamed for something that's been a recurring issue. The user's frustration might come across as impatience rather than concern for the event. Also, the user mentioned that the clothes were slightly damp, but they told her earlier that they would be dry. If they were wrong, that's a point against them. Maybe they made an assumption that wasn't accurate, leading to a conflict.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if Jill is often late, the user's response could have been more constructive. Yelling and leaving abruptly might cause hurt feelings, even if the intention was to be on time. The user might have handled it better by staying and helping Jill get ready, or making a plan to leave early enough to accommodate delays.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user might share some responsibility. They could have handled the situation without raising their voice and perhaps been more understanding of Jill's time management issues. However, wanting to be on time isn't inherently wrong. It's a balance between being considerate to others and supporting each other in the relationship.\n\nI think the answer is A, meaning the user is in the wrong. The yelling and the abrupt departure without offering support are problematic. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the user's approach could have been more empathetic and less confrontational.\n"
