Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. They provided the context of their conversation and the situation. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, which leads to them being late. The user tried to set a time (3:45) to leave, but Jill wasn't ready. The user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, which is 15 minutes before the wedding started.\n\nThe user is asking if they're at fault. They mention that Jill is upset because they were impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would dry, and yelled. The user thinks Jill is defensive because she knows she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, factors to consider: communication, responsibility, emotional response. Did the user overreact? They left their fianc\u00e9e at home, which could be seen as abandonment. Even if Jill was late, leaving her alone when they were supposed to go together might be hurtful. The user's frustration is understandable, but the action of leaving might be excessive. Also, the user didn't take responsibility for ensuring the laundry was done, maybe relying too much on Jill. \n\nBut Jill also has responsibility here for not managing her time. However, the user's choice to leave her there could be seen as selfish, especially since they're engaged. Relationships require compromise and support, and leaving her in that situation might have been more about the user's stress than helping her.\n\nAlso, raising their voice is a negative action. So even if Jill was wrong, the user's response might be harsh. The user might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a balance. The answer could be a 50/50, but the user is asking for A or B. \n\nIn many relationship scenarios, if one person's stress leads them to abandon the other, even if the other is at fault, the one who left might be seen as in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with care. So maybe answer A (yes, in the wrong) because leaving their fianc\u00e9e without ensuring she could get there, even if she was late, might be irresponsible.\n"
