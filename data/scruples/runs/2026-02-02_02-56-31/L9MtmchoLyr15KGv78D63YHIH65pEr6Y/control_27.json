Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of an AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before a wedding because they were going to be late. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a conversation earlier with Jill about leaving at 3:45 to make it to the wedding by 4:30. They gave her a heads up about needing to start early for her laundry. When 3:45 came, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, waited until 4:00, then left without her, saying they'd meet there.\n\nJill is upset because the author was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would be dry, and yelled. The author believes Jill is defensive and knows she's in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is wrong, I should consider both perspectives. The author's side is about respecting punctuality and not wanting to be late. They had given clear instructions about the time they needed to leave. Jill, on the other hand, didn't follow through with the time management, leading to the conflict.\n\nHowever, the author left Jill, who was still getting ready, and didn't wait for her even though they were both supposed to attend the event together. Leaving someone at home, especially a fianc\u00e9e, when you're supposed to be going somewhere together can be seen as abandoning them. The author raised their voice, which adds to the conflict. \n\nBut maybe Jill's consistent time management issues contribute to the problem. The author has had this conversation before, indicating a pattern. Still, leaving her at home without a way to get to the event might be inconsiderate. Was there an alternative? Like waiting a bit more or giving her a ride later? The author chose to leave, which might have caused emotional distress to Jill. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but the action of leaving might have been the wrong choice. The key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. If they left Jill stranded, that's a problem. However, if they had another way to ensure she could get there, maybe it's different. The story doesn't mention if there was a way for her to get to the wedding after the author left. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, both sides often have valid points, but the community usually looks at who acted inconsiderately or unnecessarily. The author's frustration is there, but leaving without ensuring Jill could get to the event might be inconsiderate. Also, raising their voice was unkind. So, maybe the author is at fault. Alternatively, Jill's repeated time issues are her responsibility. \n\nBut the act of leaving your fianc\u00e9e before an event, even if she's late, might be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have handled it differently, like waiting a bit longer or helping her finish getting ready instead of leaving. So, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong (A), but there's a nuance here. However, in the context of AITA, if the author's actions caused emotional harm without a better alternative, then they might be at fault. \n\nAlternatively, if the author was trying to avoid being late, maybe they're not wrong. But the fact that they left Jill at home, who was still getting ready, could be the issue. So, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they left her stranded, even if her actions contributed to the problem. Both sides have fault, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking for AITA, the community usually looks at who has more fault. In this case, the author's action of leaving might be the main issue, so the answer is A.\n"
