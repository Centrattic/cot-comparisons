Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The user (let's call him John) says that Jill isn't good at time management and they're often late. He mentions that he tried to set a clear time to leave (3:45) but she wasn't ready by then. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home to go to the wedding alone. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and was mean. John thinks she's being defensive because she knows she's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: communication, responsibility, and the actual actions taken. \n\nJohn wanted to be on time, which is understandable. He set a time, and she didn't meet it. But did he account for possible issues like the laundry not being dry? He said the clothes \"probably\" would be dry, but maybe he should have been more proactive to help or check. Also, raising his voice shows he was angry, which isn't ideal. Leaving her behind because of the time pressure is a big action. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill didn't manage her time well and left things too late. But being in a relationship, there's a mutual responsibility. If she was unprepared, maybe John could have waited a bit longer or helped her instead of giving up. However, repeatedly being late because of her time management issues might make him feel frustrated. \n\nThe problem is that John left her at home. That's a significant consequence. Even if she was at fault, leaving her behind could be seen as abandoning her during an important event. Weddings are important, and not being there as a partner could be hurtful. Also, he did raise his voice, which adds to the emotional issue. \n\nBut was he in the wrong? If they had mutual understanding and he had communicated the importance of punctuality, maybe he's justified in his frustration. However, the act of leaving her home, especially when she was in a vulnerable state (naked, with slightly damp clothes), might be too harsh. Relationships require compromise and support. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a toss-up. Both have some responsibility. John's actions were harsh, but Jill's time management is an issue. However, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since he left her home, which is a major action, and he raised his voice, maybe he's more in the wrong. But if the context is that this was a repeated issue and he couldn't take it this time, it's a gray area. But generally, in such situations, the person who leaves someone behind might be seen as in the wrong. So maybe answer A: Yes, he is in the wrong.\n"
