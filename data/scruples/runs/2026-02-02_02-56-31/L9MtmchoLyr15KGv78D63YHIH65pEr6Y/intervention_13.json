Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user, let's call them Alex, left their fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. They agreed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill wasn't ready by then, her clothes were still damp from the laundry, and she was still getting dressed. Alex got frustrated, raised their voice, and left to go to the wedding by 4:00, telling Jill to meet there.\n\nFirst, looking at the timeline: they planned to leave by 3:45. Jill wasn't ready by then. Alex waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the agreed time. That seems reasonable. The problem is Jill's time management and Alex's reaction. \n\nAlex's justification is that they wanted to be punctual and didn't want to arrive as the wedding was starting. They felt Jill was in the wrong for not managing her time better. But Alex did raise their voice, which could be seen as yelling, even if it was in frustration. That might have been disrespectful, even if Jill was late.\n\nJill's perspective is that Alex was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would dry, and was mean. She might feel that the expectation to be ready by 3:45 was unrealistic if the laundry was supposed to finish by then. Maybe Alex underestimated the drying time, or Jill overestimated her ability to get ready quickly. \n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. Even if Jill was late, Alex raised their voice, which could have been hurtful. Leaving without her might have been necessary to avoid being late, but the way it was handled could have been better. Maybe Alex should have given a clearer reminder earlier, or both could have had a more realistic time estimate. \n\nIn relationships, these situations often involve both parties. Jill's consistent time management issues might be a pattern, but Alex's reaction was to yell and leave. Both could have handled it better. However, the user is asking if they're in the wrong. The act of leaving might be understandable to avoid being late, but the yelling and not accommodating Jill's situation more could make Alex partially at fault. \n\nSo, considering the situation, it's a mix. But the user is asking for a choice between A and B. If the main issue is Alex's yelling and leaving, maybe A (they're at fault). But if the main issue is Jill's time management, then B (they're not at fault). The question hinges on whether Alex's actions were justified despite the yelling. Since Alex left to be on time and Jill was aware of the time, maybe B is the answer. But the yelling adds a layer. \n\nHmm. I think the key here is that even if leaving was necessary, the way Alex handled it (raising voice, being mean) makes them partially at fault. So AITA would be A. But others might argue that Jill is more at fault. But the answer needs to be A or B. Based on the information given, the user is asking if they're in the wrong. The community might split, but the act of yelling and leaving without a more compassionate approach could mean they are in the wrong. Hence, answer A.\n"
