Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e Jill because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the wedding started at 4:30 PM, and they needed to leave by 3:45 PM. The fianc\u00e9 had warned Jill multiple times about the time and the need to be ready. He even gave her a heads up at 1:30 PM that they needed to leave by 3:45. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45 PM, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still not ready. The fianc\u00e9 got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM to get to the wedding on time. Now Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nSo, the main points here are communication and expectations. The fianc\u00e9 had set a clear deadline because they wanted to arrive on time, which is a reasonable expectation. He tried to communicate this early, but Jill didn't take it seriously. However, when the time came and she wasn't ready, he reacted by getting angry and leaving. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he had valid concerns about being on time and had warned her. On the other hand, raising his voice was inappropriate. He also left her alone, which might have been harsh. But considering the context\u2014repeated issues with time management, prior warnings\u2014it's possible that his frustration was justified, but his method of handling it (yelling and leaving) was not. \n\nHowever, the key is whether he was wrong for leaving. If he left alone to arrive on time, maybe he should have tried to resolve the situation differently, like helping her get ready faster instead of leaving her. But the main issue is that he prioritized punctuality over her feelings, leading to her feeling abandoned. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether his actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9 did warn her, but his reaction (yelling and leaving) could be seen as wrong. However, the core issue is Jill's time management. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because he tried to communicate, but his reaction was flawed. However, in the AITA context, people often look at both sides. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he left his fianc\u00e9e alone at home when she was unprepared, which could be seen as abandoning her and not supporting her. But if the alternative was being late to a wedding, maybe it's a hard choice. \n\nBut in similar AITA scenarios, people often prioritize communication and understanding. He could have stayed and helped her get ready faster instead of leaving. His frustration led to an extreme action. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
