Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the background: The couple had a history of being late due to the fianc\u00e9e's time management issues. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting her time. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30 PM. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. They had a conversation earlier where the author warned her to start early, and she said she'd be fine. At 3:45, she wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and he got frustrated. He raised his voice and left at 4:00, arriving without her. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and yelled. The author thinks she's being defensive because she's in the wrong.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, expectations, and actions taken.\n\nThe author did warn Jill multiple times about the time. He gave her a clear deadline (3:45) and she assured him she could make it. However, when she didn't meet that deadline, he got frustrated. The author raised his voice, which is a problem. Yelling is generally considered disrespectful and can escalate tensions. Then, he left her at home. While he did meet his own deadline to get to the wedding on time, leaving a partner unprepared might not be the best approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e didn't meet the agreed-upon time, which could cause them to arrive late. The author's intention was to not be disrespectful to others by arriving late. But leaving her behind might have been a harsh action, especially if she was in an undressed state, which is potentially unsafe or uncomfortable.\n\nThe author took responsibility for his yelling, which is a good step, but the action of leaving her could be seen as abandoning her. There might have been a better way to handle it, like staying until she was ready but arriving late, or calling someone to help her get ready. However, the author's primary concern was punctuality, which is valid, but the method used (leaving) might not have been the best choice.\n\nConsidering both sides: Jill's poor time management led to the situation, but the author's response (yelling and leaving) could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because he tried to prevent being late, but his actions did cause harm to Jill. The question is whether leaving her was the right choice despite the previous warnings.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the standard is whether the person was reasonable. The author tried to set clear expectations, but when they were not met, his response was to yell and leave. That's where the potential wrongdoing is. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he escalated the situation with yelling and left her unprepared. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) because he followed through on the time commitment. But generally, in such situations, communication and support are key, and leaving someone might not be justified even if they didn't meet the deadline.\n"
