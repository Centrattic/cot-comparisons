Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThey mention that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with budgeting time, leading to them being late often. The user values punctuality and considers being late as rude. The event was a wedding starting at 4:30 PM. They gave a reminder at 1:30 PM about the laundry and the need to leave by 3:45 PM. Jill said she'd be fine, but when the time came, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she wasn't ready. The user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM, telling her they'd meet there.\n\nNow, the user is being accused by Jill of being impatient, not ensuring the clothes were dry, and being mean by yelling. The user thinks Jill is defensive and knows she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, to determine if the user is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the user tried to communicate the time constraints and gave a clear deadline. They warned Jill multiple times. Jill, on the other hand, didn't manage her time well, leading to the situation. However, the user did raise their voice in frustration, which is a form of yelling. Even if the frustration is understandable, yelling at someone, especially a partner, can be seen as disrespectful regardless of the reason.\n\nLeaving without them might be a consequence of the situation, but doing so might have been harsh. The user could have handled it differently, like staying and waiting or helping her get ready instead of leaving. However, the user's intention was to be on time for the event, which is reasonable.\n\nBut the key here is the communication. The user might have not set clearer expectations about the drying time. They said \"probably dry\" but didn't confirm. Jill might have relied on that and misjudged the time. However, the user also gave a clear deadline. The problem is that Jill didn't meet it, perhaps due to poor time management.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties share some blame. The user could have been more proactive in checking if the laundry was done, and Jill should have managed her time better. But the user's reaction of yelling and leaving could be seen as an overreaction, even if the situation was stressful.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They raised their voice, which is a clear mistake. However, the core issue is time management and communication. The user's action of leaving might be seen as holding Jill accountable, but the yelling and abrupt departure could be problematic. Therefore, the user might share some responsibility for handling the situation poorly, even if the root cause was Jill's time management. So, the answer might lean towards AITA being the user to some extent.\n"
