Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves time management issues and some raised voices.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author, let's call him Will for clarity, mentions they had a prior conversation about leaving by 3:45 to make the 4:30 wedding. Jill didn't take it seriously, and when 3:45 came, she wasn't ready. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, arriving on time. Now Jill is upset, feeling he was impatient and mean.\n\nSo, the author is asking if he's at fault. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Will tried to set a clear time to leave. He gave a heads-up, and Jill didn't follow through. He might have felt that being on time is important and that he couldn't wait longer. However, raising his voice and leaving without her could be seen as harsh, even if she's responsible for her time management. The fact that he left her at home might have caused her distress, and communication could have been better handled.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill's responsibility is to manage her time. The author did warn her, and she didn't prepare adequately. But in a relationship, how you handle frustration matters. Yelling, even in frustration, isn't ideal. However, the immediate issue is about who's at fault for the situation. The author left to keep their commitment to be on time, which is understandable, but the method of doing so (leaving her behind) is where the conflict arises.\n\nAnother angle: relationships require compromise. Maybe instead of leaving, they could have found a middle ground, like calling the wedding to inform they'd be a few minutes late, or splitting up. But the author prioritized punctuality, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The act of leaving alone might not be the issue, but the yelling and not considering Jill's feelings. However, Jill's behavior is also a factor. She didn't prepare as discussed. The author might feel justified, but in terms of relationship dynamics, walking out could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nI think the key here is that while Will tried to communicate the importance of being on time, his reaction (yelling and leaving) could be seen as overreacting. However, Jill's failure to manage her time as agreed also plays a role. The author might not be entirely wrong, but there's room for both to take some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he took action that caused harm (leaving her alone), even if justified by the circumstances, it's a gray area. But in the context of a relationship, communication is key. So, maybe the answer is that he's not entirely wrong, but there's some fault on both sides. However, based on the options given, the answer might lean towards B (no), because the author tried to follow through on his commitment and gave warnings, but his yelling could be a point against him. However, the main question is about leaving her. The answer might be A (yes) if leaving her alone was wrong, but perhaps it's B because he had a valid reason. I'm a bit torn here. In AITA contexts, people often expect a clear answer. Maybe the answer is B because the author had a reason (punctuality) and tried to make it clear. But the yelling is a negative. However, the main issue is leaving her behind. I think the community might see it as both being at fault, but the options are A or B. Since the user is the author, maybe they are not entirely wrong. But I need to decide. Given that he left her because she wasn't ready despite prior warnings, and considering that he prioritized being on time, perhaps the answer is B. But if the act of leaving her was inconsiderate, then A. Hmm. Maybe AITA situations often result in A or B based on who's at fault. Here, the author did raise his voice, which is a negative point, but the situation is also Jill's responsibility. However, the author could have handled it better. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he yelling and leaving without a better solution. But if the answer is B, then it's that he's not. I think I need to go with B, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe both are partially at fault, but the question is about the author specifically. Since he left her, which is the main action, and given that he had prior warnings, maybe the answer is A. Wait, but the wedding is important, and being on time is a social expectation. If he left to honor that, maybe it's not his fault. But the way he handled it (yelling and leaving) is problematic. It's tricky. In AITA threads, often if someone walks out, they might be considered at fault, especially if it's a partner. So maybe the answer is A. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points: he did raise his voice, but he also gave prior notice. The community might split, but I think the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he left her behind and yelled, which is hurtful. Alternatively, B if the focus is on her time management. I think the answer here is A, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the answer is B, considering he tried to communicate and left to be on time. But the yelling is a red flag. Hmm. I'm going to go with B (No), as the author had a valid reason and tried to communicate, even if the yelling was unkind. The main issue is punctuality, which he prioritized. The answer is B.\n"
