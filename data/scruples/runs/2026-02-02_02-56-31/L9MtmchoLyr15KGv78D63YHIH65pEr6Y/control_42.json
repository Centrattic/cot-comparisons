Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author (let's call them Will for simplicity) and their fianc\u00e9e Jill were supposed to attend a wedding starting at 4:30 PM, 30 minutes away. Will gave Jill a heads-up to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest to be on time. At 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp (because the laundry hadn't dried), and Will waited until 4:00 before leaving without her. He raised his voice in frustration. Now, Jill is upset, feeling that Will was impatient, didn't account for the laundry, and was mean for yelling. Will thinks Jill is being defensive because she knows she's wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether Will is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me break down the key points. \n\n1. **Communication**: Will and Jill had a conversation earlier (at 1:30 PM) where Will reminded Jill about the time. He told her to start laundry if she needed two hours. She said she'd be fine. So, she was aware of the timeline. However, maybe Will should have checked in again later to ensure she was on track, but he did mention the time once.\n\n2. **Jill's Time Management**: The problem here is that Jill isn't good at budgeting her time. She underestimated how long she'd need. But Will had set the expectation that they needed to leave by 3:45. If she needed two hours, starting at 1:30 was necessary. She might have miscalculated or not taken the time seriously.\n\n3. **The Laundry Situation**: Will had mentioned that the laundry might take two hours, so he told her to start it. But if the clothes were only slightly damp at 3:45, maybe they could have been left in a bit longer. However, the wedding was only 30 minutes away, so waiting longer might have made them late. Alternatively, maybe they could have left earlier despite the slightly damp clothes. But that's a judgment call.\n\n4. **Will's Reaction**: He raised his voice. Even if frustrated, yelling is not ideal. That could have been handled better. However, the immediate issue is that he left her. Was that reasonable? If he left because they were going to be late and he didn't want to walk in during the ceremony, that's understandable. But leaving her behind might be seen as abandoning her, especially if she wasn't ready. On the other hand, he tried waiting until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the deadline. \n\n5. **Responsibility Sharing**: Will points out that Jill was supposed to manage her time and the laundry. But he also could have been more proactive in helping her meet the deadline. Maybe he should have checked in again closer to 3:45 to ensure she was on track. However, he did set the time earlier, so perhaps it's on Jill for not adhering to that.\n\n6. **Consequences**: Will went to the wedding on time, but Jill was left behind. That's a significant consequence. Leaving someone behind, even if it's because of their own delays, can be hurtful. However, the wedding timing is important, and being late is also a consideration.\n\n7. **Emotional Impact**: Jill is upset, feeling defensive because she thinks Will is blaming her. Will feels she's deflecting. The emotional aspect is important here. Even if Jill is responsible for the time management, Will's response (raising his voice and leaving) might have been too harsh. \n\n8. **Alternatives Considered**: Did Will consider alternatives? Like calling the wedding venue to inform them they'd be slightly late, or trying to adjust their plans? Maybe not, but given the time constraint, perhaps leaving was the only option to not miss the ceremony. \n\nPutting this all together: Will set a clear deadline, Jill didn't meet it. However, Will's reaction (yelling and leaving) might not have been the best approach. While Jill is responsible for her time management, Will could have handled the situation more calmly and perhaps found a compromise. However, in terms of being in the wrong for leaving, it's a bit of a toss-up. If the deadline was non-negotiable and Will made that clear, then maybe Jill is at fault. But leaving her behind without another option could be seen as harsh. \n\nIn similar situations, some people might argue that both parties have some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author did raise his voice, which is a negative action. But leaving without her might be justified if he wanted to maintain punctuality. However, leaving a partner at home, especially in a public event, could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the key here is that while Jill's poor time management is an issue, Will's method of handling it (yelling and leaving) is not ideal. But whether that makes him in the wrong for leaving... Well, maybe not entirely. However, in terms of relationship dynamics, the way he handled it is problematic. But the question is about being in the wrong for leaving, not necessarily the yelling. \n\nIf the deadline was strict and Will had communicated it clearly, then perhaps he's not wrong for leaving her behind because he followed through on his commitment to be on time. However, in a relationship, there's also the expectation of support. Maybe he could have waited a bit longer or helped her finish getting ready instead of leaving. But he did wait 15 minutes past the deadline. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he had set the time, she didn't meet it, and he followed through to be on time. However, the yelling and leaving her behind might be seen as harsh, but maybe not necessarily making him the one at fault. In AITA scenarios, often the person who sets clear expectations and follows through isn't considered the issue if the other person fails to meet their responsibilities. However, there's a balance. The fact that he left her alone without ensuring she could get there eventually might be a problem. But he might have thought she'd manage to get there on her own later. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an assumption that they would have left together, and leaving her behind is a breach. But if they had agreed to leave by 3:45, and she wasn't ready, then leaving is a consequence of her not meeting the agreement. \n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the answer is B (No), but the nuances are tricky. The key is that the author made the decision based on the agreed-upon timeline, and while his reaction was poor, the act of leaving isn't necessarily his fault.\n"
