Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. The situation involves a wedding they needed to attend, and there were prior discussions about timing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user mentioned that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management, and they have this issue often. He told her to start getting ready by 1:30 to ensure they leave by 3:45. She said she'd be fine, but then at 3:45, her clothes were still drying, and she wasn't ready. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00, arriving at the wedding alone.\n\nNow, the user is being accused by Jill of being impatient and mean for yelling. He feels she's in the wrong because she didn't take the time management seriously. The question is whether he's in the wrong for leaving her.\n\nLooking at the details: The user did give a clear timeline (start by 1:30, leave by 3:45). Jill agreed but didn't follow through. The user waited past the deadline (until 4:00) before leaving. He raised his voice, which he acknowledges as a wrongdoing. The key points here are communication, accountability, and the actual action of leaving.\n\nLeaving a fianc\u00e9e at home to go to an event alone could be seen as a breach of solidarity, especially in a relationship. However, the user was trying to be respectful of the event's timing. But the yelling and the decision to leave alone without considering her feelings could be problematic. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the response might have been too harsh. Relationships require compromise and understanding, not just strict adherence to schedules. The user's frustration is understandable, but the action of leaving her might have been too extreme, especially without ensuring her safety or providing support. \n\nSo, while Jill should have managed her time better, the user's response of leaving and yelling might be where he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a balance here. Alternatively, if the user's actions were a reasonable response to repeated issues, maybe B. But given that he left her alone and raised his voice, which are hurtful, it's likely A.\n"
