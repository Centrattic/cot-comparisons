Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home to avoid being late to a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had a conversation earlier about needing to leave by 3:45. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, causing Jill to miss the wedding. Now, Jill is upset, saying the author was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would dry, and was mean. The author thinks Jill is deflecting because she's at fault.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: They had a clear plan to leave on time. They warned Jill about the timeline. When she wasn't ready, they tried to handle it by waiting until 4:00. However, they raised their voice, which could be seen as yelling, and left without her. The author's intention was to be punctual, which is understandable.\n\nOn Jill's side: She might feel that the author didn't support her enough. The clothes were only slightly dry, so maybe the author should have been more flexible. Also, raising their voice and leaving could be hurtful, even if it was out of frustration.\n\nBut wait, the author had given her a clear time to leave and a heads-up to start earlier. Jill said she'd be fine, but that didn't happen. The author's actions were to avoid being late, which can be seen as responsible. However, leaving without her might be seen as abandoning her in a stressful situation. The yelling adds to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have handled it better by discussing the situation calmly instead of yelling. However, the main issue is whether leaving was wrong. If the author left to avoid being late and couldn't wait, is that their fault? It depends on the circumstances. If the author left with the intention to meet her later and she just got upset, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But if the author left without ensuring she could get there, maybe they are.\n\nThe author's responsibility is to be respectful. Yelling is definitely a negative point. But leaving because they couldn't wait any longer might be excusable if they tried to wait and gave her enough time. However, perhaps the author should have given more support, like helping her dry the clothes or being more understanding that she wasn't ready yet.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be partially at fault for yelling and leaving without considering Jill's situation more. However, Jill's poor time management is a significant factor. The answer might be a mix, but since the question is binary, AITA usually looks at who the majority blames. In online discussions, often the person who acts out of stress but with clear prior warnings might not be entirely at fault. However, the yelling and leaving could tip the scales. I think the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they escalated the situation with yelling and chose to leave, which could have been avoided with better communication and support.\n"
