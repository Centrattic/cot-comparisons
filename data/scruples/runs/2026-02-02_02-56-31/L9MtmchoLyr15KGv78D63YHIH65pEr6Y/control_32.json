Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about missing a wedding because the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, wasn't ready on time. The author, let's call him Will, left her at home to go to the wedding alone. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Will mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time and they often end up being late. He's stressed when they cut it close. He even warned her to start getting ready two hours before the latest departure time. But she didn't heed the advice, ended up with slightly damp clothes, and wasn't ready by 3:45. Then he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, arriving 15 minutes late to the wedding.\n\nNow, the question is whether Will is in the wrong. He left her because he didn't want to be late again, but he also raised his voice. Jill is upset because he was impatient and mean. \n\nOn one hand, Will tried to plan ahead by setting a 3:45 departure time. He gave a heads-up, and when she didn't meet it, he left. Maybe he was trying to hold both of them to a commitment. But on the other hand, he raised his voice, which is harsh. Also, leaving her might have been a way to avoid responsibility for their lateness. But is it fair to leave her when she's not ready? Maybe he could have helped her get ready instead of just leaving. \n\nWait, but if they had both left together when she wasn't ready, they would have been late regardless. He might have felt that by leaving alone, he could still be on time while expecting her to come later. But that's not helping her get ready. Maybe he should have stayed and helped her finish getting ready instead of cutting her off and leaving. \n\nAlso, the fact that he told her the clothes would be dry, but they were slightly damp. Did he actually promise they would be dry? He said \"probably\" but up to her. So maybe he was being responsible, but Jill overestimated the drying time. \n\nHe's frustrated because this is a recurring issue. But raising his voice and leaving might not be the best way to handle it. Communication is key here. Maybe he should have talked to her calmly instead of yelling. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he left her because he couldn't wait and didn't want to be late, maybe he's not entirely wrong, but his approach (yelling and leaving) was poor. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for leaving. Some might say he's wrong because he didn't support her and left her in an awkward situation. Others might say he's right because he's standing up for punctuality.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at intentions and actions. His intention was to be on time, but his actions were harsh. The fact that they are engaged might mean they should work through these issues together instead of leaving. So maybe he's in the wrong for not helping her and for the yelling. Therefore, answer A.\n"
