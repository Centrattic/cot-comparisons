Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. So first, I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author mentions that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, leading to them being late. He's stressed about being punctual, which he considers polite. They had a conversation earlier where he warned her they need to leave by 3:45. She said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are only slightly dry. He raises his voice, waits until 4:00, then leaves alone.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's frustrated with recurring issues over time management. He's trying to avoid being late to a wedding, which he sees as important. But his reaction includes raising his voice and leaving her, which might be seen as harsh.\n\nOn the other side, Jill might feel that the author didn't give her enough leeway, maybe overestimated how long her tasks would take. She might feel blamed for the lateness, especially if the laundry didn't dry as expected. The author also says he told her the clothes would be dry, which might have been a miscommunication. She's upset about being called impatient and yelled at.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, expectations, and how he handled the situation. He did set a time and warned her, but perhaps didn't account for variables like the laundry not drying properly. However, raising his voice and leaving her alone might be seen as an overreaction. Even if she's at fault for not being ready, the way he handled it could be disrespectful or dismissive of her situation.\n\nAlso, considering they're engaged, the relationship's dynamics matter. Constant tension over time management might be a recurring issue that needs addressing together rather than individual blame. The author's approach might not be constructive. He could have waited longer, communicated more calmly, or involved her in problem-solving instead of leaving abruptly.\n\nBut the other side is that the author did try to set clear expectations. If Jill consistently struggles with time, maybe the author needs to adjust his approach to help her manage it better. However, this incident's immediate issue is his reaction. Yelling and leaving might have been unnecessary stress given that they both wanted to get there on time.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author's actions were a reaction to a recurring problem, but his method of handling it (raising his voice, leaving her) might not be appropriate. He could be in the wrong for how he handled the situation, not necessarily for wanting to be on time but for the way he enforced it. Alternatively, if Jill's behavior is a known issue that the author should have handled differently, maybe he's not entirely wrong.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the immediate action of leaving her might be seen as wrong because it's a harsh measure when there could have been another solution. The yelling adds to that. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of his reaction and handling, despite the underlying issue.\n"
