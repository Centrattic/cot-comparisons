Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about leaving the fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The author says they had a history of time management issues, where the fianc\u00e9e (Jill) often isn't ready on time. The event starts at 4:30, and they need to leave by 3:45 to be on time. The author gave a heads up, but Jill wasn't ready by then. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home to go to the wedding alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was trying to be punctual and respectful to the wedding guests by leaving on time. They had warned Jill about the time and she said she'd be fine. But when she wasn't ready, he decided to leave. On the other hand, Jill might feel that the author didn't support her enough, maybe could have waited a bit longer or helped her get ready instead of just leaving. Also, raising his voice was unkind, and leaving her alone in that state (naked) could be seen as harsh.\n\nThe author argues that Jill is being defensive because she knows she's in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. Did the author handle it the best way possible? Maybe he could have tried to help her get ready instead of leaving. But given that they were about to be late, perhaps he felt he had no choice. However, leaving her in that situation might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intention was to be on time. Also, the fact that he yelled adds to the problem. So maybe he's partly at fault for the yelling and the decision to leave, but also Jill's consistent time issues are a factor. The question is, is he in the wrong? The answer might hinge on whether the action was reasonable given the circumstances or if there was a better way to handle it.\n"
