Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding. They provided the context where they had warned her to start getting ready two hours before the deadline, but she wasn't ready when the time came. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. The user, let's call him Tom, had set a clear deadline (3:45) to leave by 4:30. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 hit, she was still getting ready. Tom got upset, raised his voice, and left. Now, Jill is upset and thinks he's impatient and mean.\n\nSo, the main issues here: was leaving her at home the right choice? Did Tom handle it appropriately? Did he consider her feelings? Let's break it down.\n\nTom's perspective: He values punctuality and thinks being on time is respectful. He warned her, gave a deadline, and when she didn't meet it, he left to avoid being late. He felt frustrated because this is a recurring issue. He raised his voice in frustration, which is a mistake in communication.\n\nJill's perspective: She's mad because he left her, which might make her feel abandoned, especially at a sensitive event like a wedding. She might feel defensive because she knows she's often late, and now she's embarrassed. She might also feel that Tom didn't trust her or support her, especially if she was already stressed about getting ready.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Arguments often stem from different priorities. Tom prioritizes punctuality and not being disrespectful, Jill might prioritize getting ready on her own terms. The problem is their communication. Tom's approach was to set a strict deadline, which she didn't meet. But when she didn't, he reacted with frustration and left, which can feel dismissive.\n\nWas Tom in the wrong? He did raise his voice, which is unhelpful. Leaving her alone at home could be seen as abandoning her, especially if she wasn't ready. Weddings are important events, so showing up late or not at all could be hurtful. Tom might have been trying to avoid being late, but he didn't consider her feelings or offer help. Instead, he reacted with frustration and left her in a vulnerable state.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill has a history of not managing time well, which Tom has had to deal with previously. He did warn her, so she had the chance to prepare. But when she didn't, he didn't stick around to help her get ready, which could have been a better solution. Maybe Tom should have stayed and helped her get ready instead of leaving. That would show support and teamwork, even if he was frustrated.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are key. Tom's frustration is valid, but his response wasn't constructive. He could have handled it by staying and helping her, or at least being more understanding. Leaving her behind, even if to avoid being late, might have been an overreaction. So, maybe he's in the wrong for not handling it with more empathy and support, despite the recurring issue.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of mutual responsibilities. If Jill knows she's not good with time management, maybe she should have been more proactive in ensuring she was ready. However, Tom could have been more flexible or supportive rather than getting angry and leaving. It's a two-way street.\n\nIn conclusion, while both have valid points, Tom's actions of raising his voice and leaving her might be seen as more detrimental because it's a sensitive situation and his response lacked empathy. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I need to make sure.\n"
