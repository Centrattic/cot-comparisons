Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. They provided some context: Jill, the fianc\u00e9e, isn't good at time management. They had a conversation earlier about leaving by 3:45, but she wasn't ready by then, so he left her at home.\n\nFirst, consider the key points. The user tried to communicate the time they needed to leave. Jill confirmed she could be ready but wasn't. The user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Were they right to leave? Well, they had a commitment (wedding) and didn't want to be late. But leaving the fianc\u00e9e at home might be seen as abandoning her, even if she was the one not being ready. Also, raising their voice was inappropriate. However, the fianc\u00e9e did agree to the time and wasn't ready, which could be her fault.\n\nBut relationships often require empathy. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the user's reaction might have been harsh. Leaving her at home could be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. Also, yelling adds to the issue. So, while Jill's time management is a problem, the user's actions (leaving and yelling) could be seen as wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the user stood by their words and left, it might be a firm but necessary action to avoid being late. However, the method of handling it (yelling and leaving her behind) might be where the user went wrong. \n\nConsidering both sides, it's a mix of both being at fault, but the user's actions might be more in the wrong because of the way they handled it. So, the answer is A (Yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
