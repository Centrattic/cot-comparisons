Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves time management issues on the fianc\u00e9e's part, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, has a history of poor time management, which causes them to be late often. The user mentions they usually get stressed when they're cutting it close. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. The user warned Jill to start getting ready at 1:30, giving her two hours, but she wasn't ready by 3:45. The user waited until 4:00, then left her at home, leading to her being upset about the raised voice and not meeting them there.\n\nThe user argues they were right because Jill was in the wrong, while Jill is upset about being left. The user's actions\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014could be seen as impatience and not being supportive, especially in a stressful situation. However, the user's intention was to be on time, which they value.\n\nKey points: Communication issues, history of similar problems, raised voice, leaving a partner behind. The user's frustration is understandable given the recurring issue, but their reaction might have been harsh. Leaving Jill at home could be seen as abandoning her, even if she caused the situation. The fianc\u00e9e might feel disrespected, especially if the user wasn't considerate enough to try helping her get ready instead of just leaving.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's frustration is valid if this is a recurring problem. But the way they handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might not be constructive. It's possible both parties have some responsibility. The user could have handled the situation with more empathy, maybe helping Jill get ready instead of just leaving, while still trying to meet the time constraint.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the user had a history of this issue, maybe they should have discussed strategies in advance. The act of leaving might have been a knee-jerk reaction, which isn't ideal. So, considering all factors, the user might be partly at fault for their reaction and the action of leaving, even if the root issue was Jill's time management. Therefore, answer A would be appropriate here.\n"
