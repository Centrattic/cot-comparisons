Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready for a wedding on time. \n\nFirst, the context: They had a discussion earlier about needing to leave by 3:45. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, said she'd be okay. But when the time came, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she wasn't ready. The user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left.\n\nSo, the user is blaming Jill for poor time management and not following through, leading to them being late. They felt leaving was necessary to not miss the ceremony. On the other hand, Jill is upset because the user didn't help, raised their voice, and maybe set unrealistic expectations by saying the clothes would dry in time.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The user's frustration is understandable if this is a recurring issue. However, leaving a fianc\u00e9e at home, even in frustration, might be seen as abandonment or not supporting each other. Also, yelling at her adds to her feelings of being attacked. While the user's intention was to be punctual, handling the situation calmly could have been better. Communication is key here. Maybe the user could have tried to help rather than leaving. Jill might also need to improve her time management. But the user's actions of yelling and leaving might be the problem here. So, the answer might lean towards AITA being the user for not managing the conflict constructively and reacting with anger.\n"
