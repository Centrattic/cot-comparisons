Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this scenario. The user, let's call him John, is asking if he's in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before a wedding they were supposed to attend together. The key points here are the timeline, communication, and their interactions leading up to the event.\n\nFirst, John mentioned that Jill isn't good at time management, and they often end up late. He wanted to avoid being late for the wedding, which starts at 4:30 PM. He told her they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, she wasn't ready. John got frustrated, raised his voice, and left alone at 4:00 PM, giving her a 15-minute buffer. She's upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, John did give a heads-up about the time, but maybe he could have set clearer expectations or checked in more. However, Jill agreed to the timeline and didn't mention needing more time. His frustration led to yelling, which is a problem, but the core issue might be about differing priorities: John values punctuality and respecting others' time, while Jill might prioritize her own timeline. \n\nLeaving her at home was a poor decision, but the main issue is the communication breakdown. John's frustration is understandable, but raising his voice and leaving without a plan to check back later could have been handled better. Jill's defensiveness might stem from feeling that her needs weren't considered. \n\nIn terms of fault, both have responsibilities. John should have managed the situation without yelling and maybe offered help or alternative solutions. Jill should have communicated her actual readiness time earlier. However, leaving someone alone at home in the middle of a task is a significant action. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key points are about communication and respect for each other's perspectives.\n"
