Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9e (Jill) is not good with time management, leading to them being late often. The author is frustrated because they value punctuality and find it important to respect others' time. The specific event was a wedding they needed to leave for by 3:45, but Jill wasn't ready by then. The author raised their voice and left her at home.\n\nFirst, the author gave a heads-up about the time they needed to leave. Jill said she'd be fine, but she wasn't ready. The author waited until 4:00, then left. So, maybe the author felt they had to act because they didn't want to be late to the wedding. But leaving Jill alone might be an issue. \n\nThe problem here is the conflict between the author's need for punctuality and Jill's time management issues. The author raised their voice, which is a form of yelling, which is considered disrespectful. However, the author might have been under stress because of the recurring issue. \n\nJill is upset because she feels the author was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would be dry, and was mean. The author argues that Jill is defensive because she's wrong. But is the author in the wrong? \n\nLeaving someone at home intentionally might not be the best action, but in a situation where the author is trying to be on time and the other person isn't ready, maybe they felt it was necessary. However, the act of leaving could be seen as abandoning the fianc\u00e9e, which is a close relationship. Even if the author is frustrated, taking that action might be problematic. \n\nBut then again, the author did wait until 4:00, which is 15 minutes after the planned departure time. Maybe the author should have handled it differently, like trying to find a solution with Jill instead of leaving. Yelling is definitely a bad move, but the core issue is the time management. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's frustration is understandable, but the method of handling it (yelling and leaving) might be where they went wrong. However, the expectation of the fianc\u00e9e to be ready on time is also part of the problem. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe the author is partially at fault for raising their voice and leaving, but Jill's repeated time management issues contributed as well. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. Since the author raised their voice and left the fianc\u00e9e, which could be seen as harsh, even if they had good reasons, it's possible that the author is partially in the wrong. However, considering the context of a recurring problem and the author's intention to be punctual, maybe not entirely. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, in relationships, communication and patience are key. The author's reaction might be seen as impatience and a lack of support. Leaving the fianc\u00e9e at home could be seen as abandoning her, which would make the author at fault. Even if Jill is responsible for her time management, the author's response was extreme. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they handled it poorly, even if the situation was frustrating.\n"
