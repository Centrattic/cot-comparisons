Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user left his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The main points are about time management, communication, and the emotional impact on both sides.\n\nFirst, Jill wasn't ready by the time they needed to leave. The user had given a clear deadline of 3:45, and she was still unready at 4:00. The user got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. Now, Jill is upset, feeling he was impatient, didn't account for the laundry timing, and was mean.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, he's trying to be punctual and respectful to others. He's had past issues with their lateness, so he's trying to avoid being late again. But his solution was to leave her behind, which might have been harsh. \n\nHowever, raising his voice and yelling could be seen as emotional harm, even if the intention was to be on time. Leaving her alone might also be problematic, especially in a relationship where mutual support is expected. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the user's reaction might have been too much. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill didn't manage her time well, which led to the problem. But the user could have handled it differently, like staying to help her get ready or at least being more supportive instead of leaving. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the user made a mistake in his reaction and the decision to leave. He could have communicated better and found another way to address the situation without being mean or abandoning her. Therefore, he might be at fault.\n"
