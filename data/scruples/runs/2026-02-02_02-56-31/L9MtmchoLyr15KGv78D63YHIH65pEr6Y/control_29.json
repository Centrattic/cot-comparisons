Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were running late to a wedding. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, had been warned multiple times about the time they needed to leave, but she wasn't ready by 3:45 PM. The author waited until 4:00 PM and then left alone, which led to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author tried to give several reminders and set a clear time to leave. They even mentioned that they find lateness rude. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e wasn't prepared on time, and the author raised their voice in frustration before leaving. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author made it clear they wanted to be on time and set a specific departure time. However, when things didn't go as planned, they reacted with frustration, which might have been an overreaction. Raising one's voice could be seen as disrespectful, even if the frustration is understandable. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that the author didn't support her or help her get ready instead of just leaving. The author's decision to leave could be seen as abandoning her, which might have emotional implications beyond just being on time to the event. \n\nBut the author's perspective is that they were respecting the time commitments of others by not being late. They might feel that the fianc\u00e9e was being negligent in her time management. \n\nIt's a bit of a toss-up. The author did set expectations and tried to communicate, but their reaction (yelling and leaving) could be seen as harsh. The fianc\u00e9e's responsibility in time management is clear, but the author's handling of the situation might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for raising their voice and leaving without ensuring the fianc\u00e9e was okay. However, the fianc\u00e9e is also at fault for not managing her time. But since the question is about the author specifically, and their actions, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the yelling and abrupt departure. Alternatively, maybe the fianc\u00e9e is more at fault, but the question is about the author's actions. \n\nAnother angle: In relationships, how we handle stress and conflicts matters. The author's frustration is valid, but their method of handling it could be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be justified if she felt abandoned. So, the author might be in the wrong for their reaction. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they raised their voice and left their fianc\u00e9e alone, which could be seen as neglectful and disrespectful. Even if the fianc\u00e9e made mistakes, the author's response escalated the situation negatively.\n"
