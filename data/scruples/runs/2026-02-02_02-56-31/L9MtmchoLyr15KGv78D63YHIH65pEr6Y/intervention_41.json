Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding because they were going to be late. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had agreed to leave by 3:45, but she wasn't ready, so he left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user was stressed about being late, which they find rude. They warned Jill earlier to start getting ready. But when the time came, she wasn't ready, and he raised his voice before leaving. Jill is upset because he yelled and didn't account for her clothes being slightly damp, which he said would be dry.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, leaving without her might have been a harsh response. Even if she was late, abandoning her could be seen as inconsiderate. The user was frustrated, but yelling and leaving might have been an overreaction. Jill's responsibility for time management is part of it, but the user could have handled the situation better. Maybe they could have waited a bit longer or communicated more calmly. The fact that he left her alone, even in frustration, could be seen as wrong because it's not helpful and might have caused her distress. So, I think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because his reaction was harsh and not supportive, even though Jill's time management is an issue.\n"
