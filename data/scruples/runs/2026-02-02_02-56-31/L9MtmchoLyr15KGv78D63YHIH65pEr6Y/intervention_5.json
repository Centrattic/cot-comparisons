Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user, let's call him John, left his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. They had discussed the schedule beforehand, with John emphasizing the need to leave by 3:45 to arrive on time. Jill didn't finish getting ready by then, and John left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. John wanted to be punctual, which is reasonable. They had a previous conversation about the timing, so Jill was aware of the schedule. However, he raised his voice in frustration, which is a red flag. Yelling can be hurtful, especially in a relationship, regardless of the situation. Then, he left her at home, which could be seen as abandoning her during a stressful moment.\n\nOn the other side, Jill might be at fault for not managing her time effectively, especially since she was aware of the departure time. But she's also his fianc\u00e9e, and he could have handled the situation differently. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe he could have tried to help her get ready faster or communicate his concerns without raising his voice.\n\nNow, considering the aftermath: Jill is upset because of his impatience, the yelling, and the fact that the clothes weren't dry. John thinks she's being defensive. However, his actions (yelling and leaving) contributed to the conflict. Even if she was in the wrong for the delay, his reaction might have escalated things unnecessarily.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. While punctuality is important, the way he handled the situation might have been more harmful. Leaving her alone in that state (naked, with damp clothes) could be seen as insensitive. He could have waited a bit longer or found a solution together instead of reacting in anger.\n\nSo, putting it all together: John made a mistake by yelling and leaving her, even if he had valid concerns about time. His actions hurt her, which is why she's upset. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. However, Jill's time management issues also played a role. But since the question is about whether John is at fault, his actions (yelling and leaving) are the main points. So, likely answer A (he's in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The key is the yelling and leaving without a better solution. So the answer is A.\n"
