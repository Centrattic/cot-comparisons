Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. They had a conversation at 1:30 where the user warned Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 to be on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, she wasn't ready, clothes were still damp, and the user left at 4:00 to not be late. Now, she's upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes were dry, and yelled.\n\nFirst, time management. The user set a clear deadline (3:45 to leave) and gave a heads-up. Jill agreed she could make it, but didn't. So he left to be punctual. That's about respecting commitments and others' time. But he raised his voice, which is a problem. Yelling is never good, especially in stressful situations. Also, he might have assumed the laundry would dry, but maybe he should have checked if she needed help or given more support instead of just setting the time and walking out. However, he was trying to avoid rudeness by being on time. Jill's fault for not managing her time, but the user's reaction (yelling and leaving) could have been handled better. Maybe he should have stayed to help her or communicated more effectively. So, both sides have some responsibility. The user is partly in the wrong because of yelling and not supporting her, but Jill is also responsible for not preparing. So answer A (yes) because even though his intent was good, his actions (yelling and leaving) were hurtful. But wait, the question is if he's in the wrong. He might think he's not, but the community might see that his actions were harsh. So AITA often emphasizes empathy. Maybe answer A, yes, he's in the wrong because of yelling and leaving without support. Alternatively, B if he's justified in wanting to be on time. Hmm, depends on balance. I think AITA threads usually consider both, but the main issue here is the yelling and abandonment. So A.\n"
