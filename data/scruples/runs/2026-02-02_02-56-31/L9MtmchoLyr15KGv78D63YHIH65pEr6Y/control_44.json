Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home to avoid being late to a wedding. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, are going to a wedding that's 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. He tells her they need to leave by 3:45 at the latest. She says she'll be fine. He checks the laundry situation again, and when 3:45 hits, her clothes are only slightly dry, and she's not ready. He gets upset, yells, and leaves at 4:00 PM to go to the wedding alone.\n\nHe feels she's in the wrong because she wasn't ready on time, and he didn't want to be late. She's mad because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and yelled. He's asking if he's the one at fault.\n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. The author is stressed about punctuality, which he sees as respectful. He gave her a heads-up about needing to leave early and trusted her to manage her time. But she didn't finish in time. He raised his voice, which is a problem. Yelling is disrespectful, regardless of the situation. Also, he left her at home, which could be seen as abandoning her, even if the event started at 4:30 and he left at 4:00. Maybe he could have waited a bit longer or handled the situation better without yelling.\n\nOn Jill's side, she might have misjudged her time, but she did say she'd be okay. However, she's not at fault entirely for not being ready. The author could have communicated better, maybe checked in more or offered help. But he did give her a clear deadline. The yelling is a red flag here. Even if she was wrong about the timing, raising his voice was unkind.\n\nThe key points are the yelling and leaving her alone. Leaving her at home could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if she wasn't expecting to be left. Also, he might have broken a promise to be there together, which could hurt her feelings. But he did go to the wedding without her to avoid being late, which he might see as necessary.\n\nHowever, the act of yelling is a significant issue. It's a form of emotional harm, and that's a problem. Even if he's frustrated, losing his temper is not acceptable. Additionally, leaving her after that could make her feel abandoned. So, while she might have contributed by not being ready on time, the author's actions (yelling and leaving) are problematic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author made mistakes by yelling and leaving her. Even if she was at fault for not being ready, his response was inappropriate. Therefore, he's partly at fault. The answer would likely be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
