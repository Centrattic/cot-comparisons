Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves time management issues on Jill's part and the user's frustration leading to a raised voice and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user tried to communicate the departure time, gave a heads-up, and when the time came, Jill wasn't ready. The user felt they had no choice but to leave to avoid being late, which they find disrespectful. However, they did raise their voice, which Jill now sees as mean. The user feels Jill is in the wrong, but she's upset about being left.\n\nThe user's main points: Jill isn't good with time, they had a conversation about the time they needed to leave, and they left when she wasn't ready. They think they acted appropriately given the circumstances. On the other hand, Jill feels wronged because she wasn't ready yet, the user didn't account for the laundry drying time properly, and was yelled at.\n\nI need to evaluate if the user's actions were justified. Leaving someone at home because they're not ready might be seen as a last resort, but it's important to consider communication and mutual respect. The user did warn Jill about the time, but maybe they could have handled the situation differently. Raising their voice adds emotional stress, which might contribute to the conflict. However, the user's intention was to be on time, which is reasonable.\n\nIn relationships, expectations and communication are key. The user might have a valid point about punctuality, but the way they handled the situation (yelling, leaving) could be seen as harsh. Jill's responsibility in managing her time and the laundry's dryness might also be part of the problem. However, the user's reaction, while perhaps understandable, could have been more empathetic.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because leaving a fianc\u00e9e at home, even if late, can be seen as abandonment and lacks support. Also, the yelling indicates a breakdown in respectful communication. On the other hand, B (not in the wrong) could be argued if time management and punctuality are core values. However, the key here is the relationship dynamics and how the action affected Jill. The user's frustration is valid, but the method of handling it might not be. So possibly A is the right answer.\n"
