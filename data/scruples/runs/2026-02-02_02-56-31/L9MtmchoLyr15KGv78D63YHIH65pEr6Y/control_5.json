Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wedding starts at 4:30, and the couple needs to leave by 3:45 at the latest to arrive on time. The author, let's call him Will, mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they often get into situations where they're late. In this specific instance, Jill didn't start getting ready as early as Will suggested. They had a conversation around 1:30 where Will set a deadline, but Jill said she'd be fine. By 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are damp, and she's naked. Will gets frustrated, yells a bit, waits until 4:00, then leaves without her.\n\nNow, the key points here are the communication, the expectations set, and the actions taken. Will had given a clear deadline and a heads-up about the timing. Jill, on the other hand, didn't act on that advice, perhaps underestimating the time needed. When the deadline hits, she's not ready. Will's frustration leads him to raise his voice and leave early.\n\nThe user wants to know if Will is at fault. The options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, Will did set a clear expectation and gave Jill the information she needed to prepare. If she didn't take that into account, maybe she's responsible. On the other hand, leaving her alone when she's not ready might be harsh. Also, yelling is a negative action, which could be seen as unkind. \n\nBut from the narrative, Will seems to be trying to be responsible about being on time, which is a common social norm. Jill's inability to manage time is mentioned as a recurring issue. However, the fact that he left her might have caused her distress, especially since she was unprepared. But if he wanted to be on time and she wasn't ready, maybe he's not entirely at fault. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The key factors are: setting a clear deadline, giving her the chance to prepare, and then acting when she didn't meet it. While yelling is a negative action, the decision to leave might be seen as his trying to uphold the commitment to being punctual. However, leaving her alone in that state (naked with damp clothes) could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the main issue is the decision to leave. If he had left and she was embarrassed or missed the event, that's a problem. However, the user's perspective is that he tried to be responsible, but maybe overstepped by yelling and leaving. \n\nI think the answer here is a bit nuanced. But according to common advice columns, people often see the person who doesn't manage time as being at fault. However, the act of leaving could be seen as harsh. But given that he tried to communicate and set boundaries, maybe he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
