Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, and they often end up late. He values punctuality, considering it respectful to others. They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30, which is 30 minutes away. The author warned Jill at 1:30 that they need to leave by 3:45 latest. He even reminded her to start early if she needed two hours. But when 3:45 hits, Jill isn't ready\u2014her clothes are slightly damp, and she's still naked. The author gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00 to get there on time. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry in time, and yelled at her. The author thinks she's defensive because she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are time management, communication, and conflict resolution. Let's consider each side. The author tried to set clear expectations. He gave a heads-up, set a deadline, and reminded her to start on time. However, he might have underestimated how long the laundry would take. He said the clothes would be dry by 3:45, but maybe he didn't account for the drying time accurately. Also, raising his voice was a mistake, as yelling can be hurtful even if the situation is frustrating.\n\nOn Jill's side, she might have overestimated her ability to get ready in time despite the warnings. She might have thought she could manage, but time slipped away. She's now feeling blamed, which could exacerbate the conflict. The author left without her, but maybe there was a better way to handle it, like giving a final warning or trying to adjust the timeline a bit if she was almost ready. However, the author's intention was to be punctual, which is valid.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The author did make an effort to communicate the deadlines and set expectations. But the issue is that he assumed the laundry would dry on time, which he didn't confirm. Also, yelling is a poor response. However, leaving to avoid being late isn't necessarily wrong, especially if he followed through on his own responsibility. Jill's defensiveness might stem from feeling criticized rather than understanding both sides. \n\nThe main question is whether the author's actions were reasonable. He had a valid reason to be on time, but the way he handled the situation (yelling) was inappropriate. Leaving could be justified if they were going to be late, but he could have handled it more compassionately. Maybe a compromise would have been better. However, considering that he tried to communicate and set clear expectations from the start, perhaps he's not entirely in the wrong. But he did raise his voice, which is a negative point. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, sometimes the answer is nuanced. Here, the author's frustration is understandable, but his response was harsh. However, Jill's repeated time management issues might contribute to the problem. The author might not be in the wrong for leaving, but he could have handled it better. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), but with the caveat that yelling was wrong. But since the question is a yes/no, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the yelling, but the core issue of leaving might be justified. Alternatively, since he tried to communicate and set boundaries, maybe B (No). I think the key is that he had a valid reason to leave (to be on time), but the yelling was the problem. However, the main question is about leaving, not the yelling. The user is asking if leaving made him in the wrong. If leaving was necessary due to Jill's repeated issues and clear communication, maybe he's not. But if he should have waited or handled it differently, then yes. It's a toss-up. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong for leaving, but he could have handled it better. Since the question is about being in the wrong for leaving, not the yelling, maybe B is correct.\n"
