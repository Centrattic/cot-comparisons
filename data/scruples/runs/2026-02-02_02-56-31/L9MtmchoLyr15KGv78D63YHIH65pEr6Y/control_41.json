Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the situation: They had a wedding to attend 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. The author warned Jill to be ready by 3:45, but she wasn't. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00, arriving on time. Jill is upset because he yelled and wasn't patient.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's actions: raising his voice and leaving without her. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to be on time, which is understandable. He had a history of being late due to Jill's time management issues. He did warn her in advance. However, he did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling and can be considered disrespectful. Leaving her at home alone, especially when she was still getting ready, might seem harsh. \n\nBut Jill is also not perfect here. She didn't manage her time well despite the warning. The author had to leave to avoid being late. However, the way he handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate, even if he was frustrated. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that Jill was in the wrong, but he might have overreacted. The question is whether his actions were justified. Leaving her at home might cause her distress, especially if she wasn't prepared. Also, he promised the clothes would be dry, which didn't happen, contributing to the problem. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, yelling and leaving someone alone in a stressful situation isn't ideal. It could be seen as not supporting each other during a problem. The author's intention was good (to be on time), but the method was harsh. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author made a mistake by yelling and leaving, even if his intention was to be on time. Therefore, he might be at least partially in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he escalated the situation by yelling and left her when she was still in a vulnerable state, which isn't considerate.\n"
