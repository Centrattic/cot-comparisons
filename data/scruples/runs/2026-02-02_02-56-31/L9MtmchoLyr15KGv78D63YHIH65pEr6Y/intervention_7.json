Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple had a wedding to attend, which starts at 4:30 PM. They live 30 minutes away, so they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. The user, let's call him John, reminded Jill at 1:30 PM that they need to leave at 3:45 and that she should start her laundry. Jill said she would be fine. Then, at 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and John gets upset, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00 PM, telling her he'll meet her there. Jill is upset because he raised his voice, said the clothes would be dry, and is being called impatient.\n\nNow, considering the details. John tried to plan ahead, gave a heads-up about the time, and communicated the need to leave. Jill, on her part, might have overestimated her time or underestimated the drying time. The user left because he didn't want to be late, which is understandable. However, he raised his voice in frustration, which is a problem. The key points here are communication, expectations, and conflict resolution.\n\nJohn's frustration is valid because they had this conversation before, indicating a recurring issue. But raising his voice and leaving without her could be seen as harsh. Jill's responsibility is to manage her time, but maybe John's reaction was too strong. The question is whether he was right to leave her at home. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. While being on time is important, yelling and abandoning her might have been an overreaction. Jill's reaction about him being impatient could be valid if he's often rushing her. Also, he might have assumed she'd be ready without checking in again, which could be a miscommunication. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user might share some responsibility. He could have handled it differently, like staying and waiting a bit more while they discussed solutions, or helping her get ready. Leaving might have been a way to avoid the conflict, but it's not helpful. Therefore, maybe he's partly at fault. But Jill's time management is also an issue. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the user being in the right because he acted to respect the event's timing and tried to communicate. However, his yelling is a negative aspect. The final judgment is a bit tricky. Hmm.\n"
