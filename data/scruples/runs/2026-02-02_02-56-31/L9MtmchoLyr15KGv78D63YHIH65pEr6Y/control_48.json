Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author left their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, is known for being late, and the author is stressed about punctuality.\n\nFirst, the author gave a heads-up about leaving by 3:45. Jill said she'd be ready, but when the time came, she wasn't. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her. Now Jill is upset, feeling her fianc\u00e9 was impatient and mean.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author wanted to be on time, which is understandable. They had warned her multiple times and gave her a clear deadline. However, leaving without her might have been harsh. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the author's reaction\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut also, the author might be stressed about being on time, which is a valid concern. They tried to communicate the importance of the deadline. However, maybe there was a better way to handle it, like waiting a bit longer with empathy or helping her get ready instead of leaving abruptly. \n\nThe key points here are the communication style and the decision to leave. The author's frustration led to a raised voice, which is unkind. Also, leaving without ensuring Jill got to the wedding on another way might be considered selfish. On the other hand, the author tried to manage the situation with prior warnings. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. Even if one party is at fault, how the other reacts matters. The author could have handled it with more patience and support. So, while Jill's behavior contributed, the author's actions might still be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be partially in the wrong.\n"
