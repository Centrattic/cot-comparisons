Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time and they often end up late. He values punctuality and considers lateness rude. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. He told her they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she was still not ready, still in her underwear, clothes slightly damp. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, saying he'd meet her there.\n\nNow, the author is arguing that Jill was in the wrong because she didn't manage her time, he was trying to be punctual, and he was upset because this happens often. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would be dry, and yelled at her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Communication between the couple, 2) The expectation of punctuality vs. Jill's time management, 3) The method the author used to handle the situation (raising his voice, leaving alone).\n\nThe author did warn Jill earlier about the time constraints (1:30 PM) and set a clear deadline (3:45 PM). However, he didn't follow up again closer to the deadline. Maybe he should have checked in again to see if she was on track. Also, yelling at her shows frustration, which might have been unnecessary. Leaving her at home was a harsh action, especially in the context of a wedding, which is a significant event where being together as a couple is expected. He prioritized punctuality over his partner's feelings, which could be seen as dismissive. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the author's response of leaving might have been an overreaction. It's important to consider that both parties might have contributed, but the question is whether the author was in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to communicate the importance of time, which is reasonable. However, the way he handled it (yelling, leaving) could have been avoided. There might be a lack of empathy here. The author might have considered helping Jill get ready instead of getting frustrated. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are key. While Jill's time management is an issue, the author's response of leaving alone might not be the best approach. It's possible that both are in some way at fault, but according to the user's instruction, we need to answer if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions, while frustrated by a recurring issue, could be seen as not in the wrong because he was trying to adhere to the agreed-upon time. However, the method of handling it (yelling and leaving) might make him partially at fault. But the question is specifically about leaving her. If the author left her because he couldn't wait anymore to be on time, is that acceptable? Some might say yes if punctuality is a priority, but others might say no because it's neglecting the partner's needs. \n\nGiven that the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are AITA, I think the answer is A (Yes) because leaving the fianc\u00e9e at home, even in frustration, could be seen as inconsiderate and possibly in the wrong, especially considering the emotional impact and the alternative solutions (like helping her get ready instead of leaving). The author might have overstepped by leaving her alone in the situation.\n"
