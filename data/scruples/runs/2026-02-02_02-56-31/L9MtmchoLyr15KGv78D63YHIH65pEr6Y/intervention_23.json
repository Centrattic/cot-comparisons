Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e named Jill who isn't good at time management, and the user left her to attend a wedding because they were going to be late. The user was worried about being late and had mentioned the need to leave by 3:45. Jill didn't get ready in time, and the user left her at home.\n\nFirst, the user raised their voice in frustration, which probably wasn't helpful. Yelling can be hurtful even if the intention is to be on time. Then, they left Jill at home. That's a big deal because they're engaged, so it's a close relationship. Leaving someone behind, especially at home, might feel abandonment or disrespect. \n\nThe user's reasoning is about being on time and not wanting to be rude. But Jill's response is that the user is impatient, didn't account for the laundry not being dry, and was mean by yelling. The user argues that Jill was the one who didn't manage her time and that she's being defensive.\n\nSo, on one hand, the user tried to set a time and give a heads-up. On the other hand, the user didn't consider that the laundry might not dry in time, even if Jill said she would be fine. Also, yelling and leaving might have been an overreaction. The user could have approached the situation with more patience, maybe helped Jill get ready instead of getting frustrated and leaving. \n\nLeaving a fianc\u00e9e at home, especially in a vulnerable state (naked), might be seen as inconsiderate. Relationships require communication and support. The user's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it could be seen as harsh. \n\nI think both sides have some responsibility. Jill should have been more realistic about her time, and the user should have managed the situation without yelling and leaving. But the core question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since they left Jill, which could be seen as abandonment, and raised their voice, it's possible they did overstep. But the user's intention was to be on time. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is that the user is somewhat at fault for the yelling and leaving, but Jill also shares responsibility. However, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since the user is the one who left their fianc\u00e9e, which is a significant action, that might tip the scales towards them being at fault. So answer A.\n"
