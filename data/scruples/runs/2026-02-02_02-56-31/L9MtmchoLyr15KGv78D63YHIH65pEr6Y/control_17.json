Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e behind because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves time management issues and a conflict about punctuality.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author, let's call him Will, and his fianc\u00e9e Jill had a wedding to attend. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they live 30 minutes away. Will told Jill they need to leave by 3:45 at the latest to arrive on time. He reminded her to start getting ready if she needed two hours. Jill said she'd be fine. But at 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and he gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00, telling her he'll meet her there. \n\nJill is upset because he was impatient, said the clothes would be dry, and yelled. Will thinks she's deflecting because she knows she's wrong.\n\nSo the question is whether Will is in the wrong. The possible angles here are communication, expectations, and handling stress.\n\nWill tried to set a clear deadline (3:45) because he values punctuality and considers lateness disrespectful. He gave a heads-up, and Jill assured him she'd be ready. When she wasn't, he acted on his frustration. But he raised his voice, which he acknowledges as his wrongdoing. Then he left her, which caused her to be upset.\n\nOn one hand, Will had a valid concern about being late to a significant event. He communicated the time they needed to leave. Jill might have underestimated the time needed, leading to the conflict. However, Will's response\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might be seen as harsh. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, Will's reaction could have been more composed. Leaving her alone when she's not ready might have been unnecessary, especially if he could have waited a bit longer or helped her get ready instead of just leaving.\n\nBut then, the wedding is a time-sensitive event. If they were going to be late to the start because of her preparation, maybe leaving to make a timely entry is understandable. However, the fact that he left her in a state where she wasn't even dressed yet seems extreme. Also, he mentioned she was still naked, so maybe there's a safety or dignity aspect here. Leaving her alone in such a state could be problematic. \n\nAnother point is communication. Will said he told her the clothes would be dry, but if they were slightly damp, maybe there was a miscommunication there. He might have assumed they would dry in time, but if Jill relied on that and then it didn't happen, that's a point of contention. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some role. Jill didn't manage her time well despite prior warnings, and Will reacted with frustration and left her. However, the question is about whether Will is in the wrong. His actions (yelling, leaving) are his fault, but the core issue might be mutual. \n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks for who has the bigger fault. While Jill's time management is an issue, Will's response could be seen as inconsiderate. Leaving her alone when she's not ready might not be helpful, even if he thought it was necessary. However, if the wedding was starting and they couldn't make it on time, maybe he had to choose between being late for the ceremony or leaving her to get there. \n\nBut the fact that he left her in a state where she wasn't even dressed suggests he didn't consider her situation. Also, the yelling is definitely his fault. So, while Jill is responsible for not being ready, Will's actions in handling the situation could be seen as wrong. Therefore, he might be the asshole for his reaction and decision to leave her, even if she was partly at fault. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his reaction was harsh and he left her in a vulnerable state. Even if she was responsible for her time management, his approach was inconsiderate and contributed to the problem.\n"
