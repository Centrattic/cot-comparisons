Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves Jill, who is the author's fianc\u00e9e. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at time management, leading to them often being late. \n\nThe key points here are the event: a wedding starting at 4:30. They're 30 minutes away. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill didn't start her laundry in time, and when the time came, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, telling her he'd meet her there. Jill is upset because he yelled, didn't account for the laundry time, and left her.\n\nSo, the author's defense is that Jill knows her own time management issues and the author tried to give a heads-up. The author feels Jill is in the wrong for not being ready. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, consider communication. The author did warn Jill about the time, told her to start the laundry early. But maybe he didn't set clearer expectations. However, Jill didn't follow through. The author got frustrated and raised his voice, which is a problem. Yelling is usually considered disrespectful, even if in frustration. Then he left her. Leaving someone alone when they're not ready, especially for a wedding, might be seen as abandoning her. Weddings are important events, and being late is considered rude, but so is leaving someone behind. \n\nThe author might argue that he wanted to be punctual, but his method of handling it was inappropriate. Yelling and leaving could be seen as the wrong approach, even if the intent was to be on time. However, the root issue is Jill's time management. The author tried to set a deadline, but maybe didn't check in more. But ultimately, leaving her might not be the best solution. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The author could have been more patient or found another solution, like calling someone to help. But leaving her and being harsh might be the immediate issue. So, the answer is probably A, because he yelled and left her, which is inconsiderate despite the situation. Or B, if the problem is more on Jill's time management. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The act of leaving her might be seen as the author's choice, and the yelling is a definite mistake. So maybe A, he is in the wrong because he handled it poorly. Even if Jill is at fault, the author's actions (yelling, leaving) are inconsiderate and disrespectful. The answer is likely A.\n"
