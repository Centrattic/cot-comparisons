Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. The situation is about a wedding they needed to attend, and there's a conflict over time management.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author (let's call him John) mentions that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, leading to them being late often. He values punctuality and finds lateness rude. The key points are that they had agreed to leave by 3:45, but at 3:45, Jill wasn't ready. John waited until 4:00, got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her.\n\nNow, the user wants to know if John is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn John's side: He tried to communicate the need to leave early, gave a heads-up. He waited an extra 15 minutes, which is reasonable. He was trying to be respectful by not being late to the wedding. His frustration led to raising his voice, which isn't ideal, but the main action was leaving to avoid being late. Maybe he felt responsible for their punctuality, especially since they were going together.\n\nOn Jill's side: She might not have managed her time well, leading to the problem. She could feel that John didn't support her or was being overly strict. The fact that the clothes were slightly damp suggests maybe the laundry wasn't done as promised, which could add to the tension. Jill being upset about being called impatient and defensive might indicate she feels misunderstood or unfairly blamed.\n\nBut leaving a fianc\u00e9e at home because of a scheduling conflict... is that acceptable? It depends on context. John left to not be late, but it's a significant action. Was there an alternative? Maybe he could have waited a bit longer or communicated better. He did raise his voice, which is a negative aspect. However, the core issue is time management and differing priorities.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If this is a recurring problem, there should be a discussion about solutions rather than unilateral decisions. But in this specific instance, John acted to adhere to his value of punctuality. However, leaving without a plan to meet up later might have been harsh. The fact that they were going to the same event, so leaving her there could cause her to miss it too, but he went alone. \n\nIs John in the wrong? He did communicate his needs, but his reaction (yelling and leaving) might be seen as extreme. But considering the context of repeated issues, maybe he was trying to enforce accountability. The final judgment would hinge on whether leaving was a reasonable response given the circumstances. Since he waited 15 minutes and then left, maybe it's a split, but the main question is about being in the wrong. The answer might be that both have some responsibility, but the question is specifically about the author. The user's fianc\u00e9e is defensive, which might imply she's aware she's not fully in the right. However, John's actions could be seen as harsh. \n\nAlternatively, in some perspectives, if you're going together, you shouldn't leave the other behind, even if they're late. But if the event is important and they can't compromise, perhaps leaving was necessary. It's a tricky call. The answer could be A or B depending on perspective. However, the key factors: communication attempts, waiting, the yelling, and the recurring issue. The act of leaving might be seen as wrong because it's a relationship issue where support is expected. So maybe A (yes, he's in the wrong). But others might argue it's justified. Need to decide based on the details given.\n"
