Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They often end up late, which stresses the user. The user values punctuality and sees being late as disrespectful. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. The user told Jill to leave by 3:45 at the latest, but at 3:45, Jill wasn't ready. The user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, telling Jill to meet them there. Now, Jill is upset, feeling the user was impatient, made promises about the laundry, and was mean. The user thinks Jill is being defensive.\n\nSo, the key points are: communication issues, time management problems, emotional response, and the decision to leave.\n\nThe user's perspective is that Jill was responsible for her time and the laundry. They set a deadline, but Jill didn't meet it. The user felt it was better to go without her to avoid being late to the event. However, raising their voice and leaving her alone might have been too harsh. \n\nFrom Jill's side, she might feel that the user didn't account for the laundry not being dry as expected, leading to her not being ready. She might also feel disrespected by being left alone, especially after the user raised their voice. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user set a time, but maybe didn't check in again to see if there were issues. Also, the user's frustration led to yelling, which is a negative reaction. Leaving the fianc\u00e9e alone, even if it's to avoid being late, could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry). \n\nThe user's intention was to be respectful to the wedding guests, but their method might have been too harsh. There's a balance between being on time and being considerate to one's partner. Maybe there was a better way to handle the situation, like helping Jill get ready or finding an alternative, rather than just leaving. \n\nAlso, the user made a comment about the laundry probably drying, but if that wasn't the case, that's a point of contention. Jill might feel the user didn't support her in managing her time, leading to the problem. \n\nSo, while the user's intention was to be punctual, the execution had issues. Raising their voice and leaving Jill alone could be seen as inconsiderate and impulsive. Therefore, the user might share some responsibility here. It's a judgment call, but there are elements where the user could have handled it better.\n"
