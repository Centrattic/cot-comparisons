Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e named Jill who wasn't ready on time for a wedding they needed to attend. The person left her at home because they were going to be late. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The person set a deadline of 3:45 to leave by 4:00, but Jill wasn't ready. They raised their voice in frustration and left. Jill is upset because she feels they were impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled.\n\nSo, the key points here: communication, expectations, and handling stress. The person had given a heads-up about the time, which is important. But maybe they could have done more to help Jill prepare. Like, instead of waiting until the last minute, maybe they should have checked in earlier. Also, raising their voice in frustration is a negative reaction that could have been managed better. Leaving without her might be seen as abandoning her, even if they were worried about being late.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill admitted she's not good at time management and the person had given her multiple chances. The person's frustration might be understandable, but acting in a way that causes hurt (yelling, leaving) is not ideal. Maybe there's a middle ground where they could have found a solution together, like leaving early or helping Jill get ready faster.\n\nI think the person is partly in the wrong because yelling and leaving without support isn't helpful. However, Jill also has responsibility for not managing her time. It's a shared responsibility scenario. But since the question is whether the person is in the wrong, and they chose to escalate the situation by yelling and leaving, that's a red flag. So maybe answer A (Yes) because their actions were harsh, even if the frustration was there.\n"
