Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The scenario involves a recurring issue where Jill struggles with time management, leading to them often being late. The author's intention is to be punctual and respectful, so they set a firm departure time of 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding. Jill wasn't ready by then, and after getting frustrated and raising their voice, the author left her at 4:00, telling her they'd meet there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author tried to communicate the importance of leaving on time, which they see as respectful. They gave a clear deadline and waited until the last minute. Jill, on the other hand, didn't manage her time well, leading to the situation. The key points here are communication, expectations, and conflict resolution.\n\nThe author raised their voice in frustration. Yelling can be seen as disrespectful, even if the intention was to avoid being late. While the author's goal was to be punctual, the method of addressing the situation (yelling and leaving) might have been harsh. Leaving a partner behind, especially at home, could be seen as abandoning them, which might cause emotional distress. However, the author did intend to meet her there later, so it wasn't a complete abandonment.\n\nJill's behavior is a recurring issue, as mentioned by the author, indicating a pattern. The author tried to set boundaries but might not have given Jill enough support or flexibility. Maybe a more collaborative approach, like checking in on her progress or offering help, could have been better than leaving. But the author's frustration is understandable given past experiences.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions crossed a line. Leaving someone at home might seem extreme, but the context of repeated lateness complicates things. The author's decision to leave was to maintain punctuality, but the emotional response (yelling) and the action of leaving could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, the author did try to communicate the necessity of being on time.\n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties might share some responsibility. Jill didn't meet the deadline, which is her responsibility, but the author's response was to leave, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been better. However, the act of leaving, while extreme, might be justified by the author's prioritization of punctuality, but the yelling adds to the tension.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were proportionate. Leaving someone at home is a significant action, and even if justified by the reason, the method could be questioned. So, there's a case to be made that the author is partially at fault for the yelling and the decision to leave, but Jill's repeated time management issues also play a role. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the options are A for yes and B for no, I need to weigh these factors.\n"
