Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author left their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding. The main points to consider are communication, expectations, and how they handled the situation.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. The author had already warned her multiple times to start early, emphasizing the need to leave by 3:45. She assured him she'd be ready. But when 3:45 came, she wasn't, and her clothes were only slightly dry. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left after waiting until 4:00.\n\nThe key issues here are the author's reaction. He had prior knowledge of Jill's tendency to be late and had set clear expectations. However, when she didn't meet them, he escalated by yelling and leaving. Even though he was stressed about punctuality, raising his voice is a red flag. Yelling can be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the reason. Also, leaving her alone when she wasn't ready might be inconsiderate, especially if she needed help or support. He could have tried to help her get ready instead of abandoning her.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill's lack of time management is a problem too. She knew the author valued punctuality and yet didn't prepare adequately. However, the author's response of yelling and leaving might have been a harsh reaction. The situation shows a communication breakdown. The author could have handled it better by staying calm and assisting her, rather than escalating the conflict.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author did make mistakes by yelling and leaving. Even if Jill was at fault for being unprepared, the author's method of handling it could be seen as inconsiderate and disrespectful. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
