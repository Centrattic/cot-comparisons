Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they were in the wrong when they left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. The user told Jill they should leave by 3:45 at the latest. But by 3:45, Jill wasn't ready. The user got upset, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM, saying they would meet there. Now, Jill is upset because the user was impatient, didn't account for the laundry timing, and yelled. The user thinks Jill is being defensive.\n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. The user wanted to be punctual, which is understandable. Being on time is important for social events. They warned Jill about the time, so maybe they thought they had communicated clearly. But Jill's not ready, and the user's reaction was frustration and leaving her. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill might have overestimated her time or underestimated the drying time. The user said the clothes would be dry \"probably,\" but Jill might have taken that as a guarantee. If the laundry wasn't done, that could be a problem. The user's yelling adds to the issue, as raising one's voice can be seen as disrespectful, even if the user was stressed. \n\nLeaving Jill at home without her seems harsh, especially if she wasn't ready. Even if she's at fault for not managing her time, the user's solution was to abandon her. That could make the user appear selfish or not supportive. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe the user should have handled the situation differently, like trying to help Jill get ready instead of leaving. Also, the user's impatience might be a recurring issue if this kind of thing happens often. \n\nSo, was the user in the wrong? They did take a drastic action by leaving their partner, which could be hurtful. Even if the user's intention was to be on time, the method might be questionable. The yelling and leaving Jill alone might make the user share the blame. So, perhaps the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong). But maybe some would argue the user had a valid reason to be on time. However, the way it was handled could be the issue. I think the user is at least partially in the wrong.\n"
