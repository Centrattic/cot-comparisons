Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at managing time. They have this recurring issue where they end up late. The wedding is 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. They talked in the morning about doing laundry and setting a departure time of 3:45. The user told Jill to start her laundry on time, but she didn't. When 3:45 came, she wasn't ready, clothes were slightly damp. The user got frustrated, raised their voice, waited until 4:00, then left without her.\n\nNow, the user's reasoning is that they didn't want to be late, which they consider rude. They think Jill is being defensive because she knows she's wrong. But Jill is upset that he left, called her impatient, yelled, and didn't account for the clothes not being dry when he said they would be.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication, expectations, and the action of leaving. The user set a time to leave, which Jill didn't meet. But when the time came, her clothes were only slightly damp. Maybe the user underestimated the drying time? They told her clothes would be dry by 3:45, but maybe that was an assumption. Then, when she wasn't ready, he escalated by yelling and leaving.\n\nLeaving someone alone in a relationship, especially when it's a recurring issue, can be seen as harsh. The user may have acted out of frustration, but the act of leaving could be hurtful. Also, raising one's voice during stress is a common reaction, but it's not helpful. However, Jill's chronic time management issues might contribute to the problem.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? It's a bit of both. The user should have maybe checked the dryer time more accurately and handled the frustration without yelling. But Jill also has to take responsibility for her time management. However, the act of leaving the fianc\u00e9e at home, even in frustration, might cross a line. It's important to consider both perspectives. The user might have a valid reason for not wanting to be late, but the method of handling it (leaving) could be problematic. So, maybe they are partially at fault. But the question is whether they are in the wrong (A) or not (B). Given the situation, it's a tricky balance. The user's actions were reactive, but the solution (leaving) might not be the best approach. So, possibly AITA is yes, so answer A.\n"
