Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they left their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they had agreed to leave by 3:45. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, wasn't ready by 4:00, so the author left without her. She's upset because he raised his voice and left her. He feels she's being defensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author was stressed about being late because they both often are. They mentioned that they had discussed the timing before, and Jill said she'd be fine. When she wasn't ready, he got frustrated and left. On the other hand, Jill might feel that he didn't support her in getting ready, maybe even gave her the wrong information about the laundry drying time. He also raised his voice, which is a negative action regardless of the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, leaving someone at home right before a wedding could be seen as inconsiderate. Weddings are important events, and being there together is expected. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he handled it\u2014yelling and then leaving\u2014might be the main issues here. Also, he mentioned that the laundry was probably dry, but if she was still in damp clothes, he might have contributed to the problem by not checking properly. However, Jill's tendency to not manage time well is part of the recurring issue. \n\nBut even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the author's response of yelling and leaving could escalate the conflict. In a relationship, how you handle stress and conflicts matters. Leaving someone alone in that situation might not be helpful, even if the intention was to arrive on time. There might have been a better way to handle it, like staying and helping her get ready, even if it meant being late, or communicating more effectively without raising his voice.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the yelling and leaving, even if Jill was responsible for her part. Relationships often require compromise and support, and the way he handled the situation might have caused more harm than the lateness itself. But I'm not sure if the fault is entirely on him. Hmm.\n"
