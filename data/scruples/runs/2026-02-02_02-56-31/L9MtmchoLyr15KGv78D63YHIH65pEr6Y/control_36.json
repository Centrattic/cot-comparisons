Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home. The situation is about being late to a wedding. The author, let's call him Will for this, had set a strict time to leave at 3:45, but Jill wasn't ready until later. He raised his voice, left her at home, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Will mentions that Jill often has trouble budgeting time, leading to them being late. He values punctuality and finds it rude to be late. He gave her a heads up at 1:30 that they need to leave by 3:45. She said she'd be fine. Then, when she wasn't ready by 3:45, he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill was left at home, which is a big deal. The wedding was only 30 minutes away, but her clothes were slightly damp, so maybe the laundry didn't dry. Did Will promise they'd be dry? He said \"probably up to you,\" which might imply she was responsible for timing the laundry. But if he told her they needed to leave by 3:45, maybe it was his responsibility to ensure the laundry was done. \n\nHe left her there, so she missed the wedding. That's a significant consequence. He got angry and raised his voice, which is a problem. Even if she was late, leaving her alone might be seen as abandoning her during a stressful time. She's upset because he was \"impatient,\" which maybe he was, but he was trying to avoid being late. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? He tried to communicate the need to leave on time, gave her a heads up, but when she wasn't ready, he took action. However, leaving her at home might have been a harsh reaction. Perhaps a better approach would be to stay with her, help her get ready, or make alternative arrangements. \n\nAlso, he mentioned he was mean by yelling. That's definitely a problem regardless. Even if she was in the wrong for not timing her laundry correctly, yelling is not okay. \n\nSo, the author did raise his voice, left her at home, and now they're both upset. The key points are the raised voice and the decision to leave her. While Jill might have contributed by not being ready, the author's actions led to her missing the event. \n\nIn terms of AITA, it's often about how the actions affect the other person. Leaving a fianc\u00e9e at home is a major action. Even if she was at fault for not preparing on time, the author's response was extreme. Maybe a compromise would be better, like calling someone to take her or waiting longer. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is partially at fault for his reaction and the decision to leave. So the answer is A.\n"
