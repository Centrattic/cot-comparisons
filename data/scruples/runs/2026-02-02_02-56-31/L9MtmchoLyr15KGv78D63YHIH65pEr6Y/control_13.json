Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The context is that the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. The author, let's call him Will, had warned her multiple times that they needed to leave by 3:45 to make it to the wedding starting at 4:30. She said she'd be okay, but when 3:45 hit, she wasn't ready, so Will left her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Will was stressed because they were going to be late, which he finds rude. He raised his voice, which Jill sees as being mean. He left her at home to make it to the wedding on time. On the other hand, Jill didn't manage her time well, and she's upset that he left her and that he told her the clothes would be dry (which might not have been the case). She feels defensive.\n\nSo, the main points here are about responsibility and communication. Will might feel he did the right thing to avoid being late, but leaving his fianc\u00e9e isn't a solution. Raising his voice adds to the conflict. However, Jill's time management is also a problem. But the key question is whether Will was wrong in leaving her. \n\nLeaving someone at home, especially a fianc\u00e9e, could be seen as abandonment in a stressful situation. Even if he was frustrated, leaving her there might not be the best approach. Maybe he could have waited a bit longer or found another solution instead of acting out of frustration. Also, he did raise his voice, which is unkind. But he's trying to be on time, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the flip side, Jill should have been more prepared. But the author's action was to leave her, which could cause her to miss the wedding entirely. That's a big deal. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation better and for his reaction. But maybe part of the problem is Jill's recurring time issues, which the author should have addressed earlier rather than at the last minute.\n\nI think the author made a mistake in both raising his voice and leaving her. While Jill's time management is an issue, the author's response was not constructive. Leaving her alone in that state is not helpful and could be seen as insensitive. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A). But maybe there's a middle ground where both have some fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the action of leaving her, which could lead to her not attending the wedding, and the raised voice, which is unkind, the answer seems to be AITA (A) the author is in the wrong.\n"
