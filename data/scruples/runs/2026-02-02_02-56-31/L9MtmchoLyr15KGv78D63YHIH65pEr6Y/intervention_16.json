Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready on time. They had a wedding to attend, and they set a time to leave. She said she'd be ready, but when the time came, she wasn't. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e might not be great with time management, which the user has mentioned before. The user tried to give a heads-up about the time they needed to leave. He even asked if she needed her clothes in the laundry, which she said she did. So he set a time, 3:45, and she said she'd be okay. But when the time came, her clothes were still damp, and she wasn't ready. \n\nThe user waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the agreed time, and left. He says he raised his voice in frustration. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled. The user thinks she's being defensive because she knows she's wrong.\n\nNow, to determine if the user is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, expectations, and conflict resolution. The user set a clear time to leave, and the fianc\u00e9e assured him she'd be ready. However, she didn't manage her time well, leading to the clothes not being dry. The user's frustration led to yelling, which is an issue regardless of the situation. \n\nLeaving without her might be seen as a harsh reaction. Even if she was at fault for not being ready, the user could have handled it differently. For example, staying to help or discussing the situation calmly. Yelling and leaving might have been an overreaction, even if the fianc\u00e9e was being late. \n\nAlso, the user's expectation that the clothes would be dry by 3:45 was communicated, but the fianc\u00e9e's response was \"I'll be fine,\" which she didn't follow through on. However, the user might have should have checked in closer to the time or offered assistance. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user's frustration is valid, but the way he handled it (yelling and leaving) could have been hurtful. The fianc\u00e9e's defensiveness might stem from feeling attacked rather than understanding the user's perspective. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the user shares some responsibility. He could have communicated better, maybe helped her get ready instead of leaving. But he also had a valid concern about being on time. However, the act of leaving without her and raising his voice is problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A, that he's in the wrong, but I need to check if the answer is A or B.\n"
