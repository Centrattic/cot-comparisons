Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. They mention that Jill isn't good at time management and they've had issues with lateness before. The key points are the timeline, communication, and the actual actions taken.\n\nFirst, the wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. They agreed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. The user reminded Jill at 1:30 that they needed her to start getting ready early to ensure the laundry was dry. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she wasn't ready. The user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, meeting the wedding party as they walked down the aisle.\n\nNow, considering the arguments for and against. The user's perspective is that they tried to plan ahead, gave a clear deadline, and left when things looked like they'd be late, which they see as responsible. Jill's side is that she felt rushed, the clothes weren't dry as promised, and the user was mean by yelling.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the user might have overstepped by raising their voice, which is a common point in arguments. However, leaving alone might be seen as a last resort after repeated issues with time management. But the user did wait until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the deadline, so maybe that's a buffer. \n\nThe user also said the laundry would be dry, but Jill's clothes were only slightly damp. Maybe the user didn't check the dryer, leading to a miscommunication. Also, leaving a partner alone before an event could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if she wasn't ready yet. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some role. The user set a clear expectation but might have handled the frustration poorly. Jill didn't manage her time as agreed. However, the act of leaving might be seen as cutting off support during a stressful time, which could be hurtful. \n\nBut the user's intent was to be punctual, which is a valid concern. The frustration might be justified, but the method of handling it (yelling and leaving) could be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all factors, it's a mix. The user might not be entirely at fault, but their actions contributed to the conflict. Jill also shares some responsibility. But the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since they left, which could be seen as abandonment in a stressful situation, and the yelling, it's possible they are at fault. However, if Jill knew her own habits and didn't prepare, maybe the user isn't entirely wrong. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the user being partly at fault for the yelling and leaving, but not entirely. However, the question is a binary choice between A and B. Given that, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because of the yelling and leaving, but it's not a clear cut case. Alternatively, it could be B if the user's intent was to manage time properly. Hmm.\n"
