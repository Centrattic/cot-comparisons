Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding because they were going to be late. The situation involves time management issues and communication problems.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with budgeting time. They had a prior conversation where they set a 3:45 PM deadline. But at that time, Jill wasn't ready, clothes were damp, and she was still in the house. The user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left her to go to the wedding alone.\n\nNow, let's look at both sides. The user's argument is that they were trying to be punctual and respectful, so they left when it became clear they'd be late. They feel Jill is defensive because she knows she messed up. On the other hand, Jill might feel that the user didn't support her, got angry, and abandoned her without ensuring she got there.\n\nKey points to consider: Did the user have a valid reason to leave? They were concerned about arriving on time, which is understandable. However, leaving Jill alone when she wasn't ready could be seen as abandoning her. Also, the user raised their voice, which is a form of yelling, which is unkind. The user might have handled it differently, perhaps by staying to help her get ready instead of leaving. \n\nJill's perspective: She might feel she was left without support, especially since she was still in the process of getting ready. The user told her clothes would dry, but they were damp, which she might see as a lie or a miscalculation. Her frustration could stem from feeling unsupported and blamed.\n\nCommunication issues are present. The user set a deadline early, but maybe they should have checked in more during the time leading up to it. Jill might have expected more flexibility or help. The user's frustration led to a harsh reaction, which could hurt their relationship.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal values (like punctuality) with empathy and support. Leaving a partner in a stressful situation might not be the best approach, even if the intention was to keep a commitment. The user could have tried to resolve the situation together instead of leaving. \n\nSo, considering all that, while the user's intention was to be punctual, their actions might have been too harsh. They could be seen as in the wrong for leaving Jill alone and raising their voice. The situation highlights the need for better communication and problem-solving together rather than unilateral decisions.\n"
