Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. They provided a detailed scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had agreed to leave by 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding. The user mentioned waiting until 4:00, then leaving. The fianc\u00e9e was still getting ready, clothes were slightly damp, and he raised his voice in frustration. She's upset because he yelled, implied he told the clothes would dry, and called him impatient.\n\nSo, the main points here: the user left because they were going to be late, he raised his voice, and now Jill is upset. The user feels she's being defensive.\n\nTo determine if he's in the wrong, consider both sides. The user tried to plan ahead by suggesting she start the laundry early. He set a clear deadline, which she didn't meet. However, he raised his voice, which is a form of yelling, even if it was in frustration. Leaving her alone might be seen as abandoning her, but the user's intention was to honor the punctuality they value.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might feel hurt that he left her, especially if she was still in the process of getting ready. The yelling could have been hurtful. The user's actions might be seen as impatience, but he was trying to be responsible. It's a time-sensitive event, and he didn't want to be late.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The user gave a heads-up about the time, but maybe there wasn't enough flexibility for unexpected delays. Jill might have underestimated the time she needed, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, conflict is normal, but the way it's handled matters. Yelling is generally not a good approach. However, the user's intent was to be respectful to the event's schedule. Jill's reaction might stem from feeling criticized for her time management issues.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The user made an effort to communicate the time constraints, but his reaction (yelling and leaving) could be seen as harsh. Jill's responsibilities in time management also play a role. It's possible that the user isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both to reflect on their actions. The user could work on managing frustration without raising his voice, while Jill could improve her time planning. However, given the situation, the user's actions were a response to a recurring issue, so maybe he isn't in the wrong.\n"
