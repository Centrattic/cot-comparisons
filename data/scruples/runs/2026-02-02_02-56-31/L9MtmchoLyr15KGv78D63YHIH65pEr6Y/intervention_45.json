Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves communication issues and differing time management styles.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time. They had a conversation earlier in the day about leaving by 3:45. At 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were still damp, and the user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left to go to the wedding. Now Jill is upset, feeling the user was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would be dry, and was mean.\n\nThe user's defense is that Jill knew the time to leave, and they were trying to be punctual. They think Jill is defensive because she knows she's in the wrong. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nSo, breaking it down: Communication is key here. The user gave a heads-up about leaving by 3:45, but Jill didn't take that seriously. However, the user raised their voice, which escalated the situation, and left Jill unprepared. Even if the user was stressed, yelling is a negative reaction. Leaving Jill alone when she wasn't ready could be seen as abandonment, even if the event started without them. The user might have handled it better by staying and helping or finding another solution instead of leaving. On the other hand, the user was trying to respect the event's schedule. But the method of handling the situation (yelling and leaving) is problematic. So, the user might be at fault for not handling the stress better and for abandoning Jill. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
