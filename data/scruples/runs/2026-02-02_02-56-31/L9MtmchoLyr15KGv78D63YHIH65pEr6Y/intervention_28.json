Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether they were wrong to leave their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The backstory is that Jill tends to be bad with time management, leading to them being late often. The user had warned her to start getting ready earlier, but she didn't, and when the time came, she wasn't ready. The user got frustrated, yelled, and left her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's perspective is that they value punctuality and see it as respectful to arrive on time. They tried to set a clear time to leave, and when Jill didn't meet that, they took action to make sure they weren't late to the wedding. They might feel justified in their actions because they were trying to uphold a value (punctuality) and avoid being rude.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might feel that the user was impatient and didn't support her through the situation. The user raised their voice, which is a form of yelling, which is generally considered disrespectful. Leaving a partner alone in a stressful situation could also be seen as abandonment, especially if she was already feeling the pressure. The user's action of leaving might have caused her additional stress and embarrassment, especially in front of mutual friends or family at the wedding.\n\nThe key points here are communication and the use of yelling. The user did set expectations, but perhaps not in a supportive way. Jill's time management issues are a recurring problem, and maybe the user should have addressed it differently, like helping her prepare earlier or planning buffer time. However, in the moment, the user's frustration led to yelling and leaving, which could be seen as a harsh reaction.\n\nAnother angle is the context of an engagement. As fianc\u00e9s, they should be working through challenges together, not against each other. The user's decision to leave might have been an attempt to be punctual but neglected the emotional aspect of supporting Jill, especially if she was already stressed about the event.\n\nAlso, the user's statement that Jill is defensive because \"she knows she's in the wrong\" suggests a potential lack of empathy. If Jill is upset because she feels unsupported, it's possible that the user's actions hurt her feelings regardless of her time management issues. Relationships require compromise, and maybe the user should have found a middle ground instead of taking a strict approach.\n\nIn terms of cultural or social expectations, being on time is important in many contexts, especially formal events like weddings. However, the way the user enforced it could be problematic. Yelling is a form of emotional abuse, and leaving a partner alone when she's unprepared might not be the best solution. The user could have waited a bit longer or helped her get ready instead of leaving in anger.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the user might be at fault for yelling and leaving, even if the intention was to be punctual. The action caused hurt and might have been a reaction driven by frustration rather than a thoughtful solution. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the user is in the wrong).\n"
