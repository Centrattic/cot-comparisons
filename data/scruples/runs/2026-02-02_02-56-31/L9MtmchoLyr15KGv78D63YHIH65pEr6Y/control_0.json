Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple had agreed to leave by 3:45 PM to make it to the 4:30 PM wedding. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, said she'd be ready, but by 3:45, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM, saying he'd meet her there. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, made a promise about the laundry, and yelled.\n\nThe main points here are about responsibility and communication. The author had given a clear deadline, and Jill indicated she could meet it. However, she didn't, leading to the conflict. The author felt the need to leave on time to be respectful to the event, while Jill feels he overreacted and is being harsh.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author did mention that this happens often, suggesting a pattern where Jill might not be managing her time well. However, raising his voice and leaving without her could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, even if he was frustrated. The promise about the laundry might not be binding, but if he led her to believe the clothes would be dry, that could add to her defensiveness.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to avoid being late, which is a common social expectation. Leaving at 4 PM when he thought they'd miss the start time might be his way of holding them to the schedule. But walking out while she's still getting ready could be seen as abandoning her, especially if she was close to being ready.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and handling the situation. The author could have discussed the situation more calmly, maybe helped her get ready or set a more realistic time. Yelling and leaving abruptly might not be the best approach, even if the frustration is understandable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable given the circumstances and if they acted in a way that respects the other person. The author's actions, while perhaps motivated by wanting to be punctual, might be seen as harsh and not considering Jill's feelings, especially in a relationship context. However, the fact that the author is self-aware enough to question his actions might tip the balance. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he raised his voice and left her, even if his intention was to avoid being late. There are better ways to handle a recurring issue without being disrespectful.\n"
