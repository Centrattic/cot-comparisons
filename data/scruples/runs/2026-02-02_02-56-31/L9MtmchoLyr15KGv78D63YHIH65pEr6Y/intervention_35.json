Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home when they were going to be late to a wedding. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They've had this issue before, leading to them often being late. The user values punctuality and finds it disrespectful to be late. The key event here is a wedding that starts at 4:30 PM. The user told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest to arrive on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she wasn't ready. The user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM without her. Now, Jill is upset, calling the user impatient and defensive.\n\nSo, the user wants to know if they're in the wrong. Let's analyze both sides. On one hand, the user had a valid concern about being on time, especially for a wedding where timeliness is important. They gave a clear deadline. Jill didn't meet that, which caused the user to act. However, raising their voice and leaving without her could be seen as harsh. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the user's reaction might have been overly aggressive. The user could have handled the stress differently, maybe by trying to help Jill get ready faster or giving a warning before leaving. Instead, they left abruptly, which might have been hurtful.\n\nOn the other side, Jill might have known the user's stress about punctuality and still didn't manage her time, leading to the conflict. The user might feel that their actions were justified to maintain respect for the event's timing. However, relationships require communication and understanding. The user's frustration led to yelling and leaving, which could damage their relationship. Even if Jill is responsible for being late, the user's method of dealing with the situation might have been unkind.\n\nAlso, considering the context of a wedding, arriving on time is important, but relationships are about support. The user's decision to leave might have been more about their own stress than considering Jill's feelings. The user needs to reflect on whether their actions were reasonable. Yelling and leaving could be seen as abandonment, especially if Jill was in a vulnerable state (naked and with damp clothes). The user's approach might have been too harsh, even if the underlying issue was Jill's time management.\n\nIn conclusion, while Jill's time management is an issue, the user's response of raising their voice and leaving without her could be seen as inconsiderate. The user might need to take some responsibility for how they handled the situation, even if Jill was partly at fault. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong.\n"
