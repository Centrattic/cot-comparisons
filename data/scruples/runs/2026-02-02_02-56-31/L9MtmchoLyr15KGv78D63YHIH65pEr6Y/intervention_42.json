Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves a recurring issue with time management and the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, not being ready on time.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that they had a prior conversation where they set a 3:45 PM deadline to leave for the 4:30 PM wedding. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, she wasn't ready. The user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM. Now, Jill is upset, feeling that the user is impatient, didn't account for the laundry time, and was mean.\n\nTo determine if the user is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. The user's perspective is that they were trying to be punctual, which they find important, and that Jill's repeated lack of time management is the main issue. They felt justified in leaving to avoid being late to the wedding. On the other hand, Jill might feel that the user didn't support her, didn't consider that the laundry might not dry in time, and that the yelling was unfair. \n\nKey points to consider: Did the user act in a way that's reasonable given the situation? Did they handle the stress appropriately? The user did give a clear deadline and warned Jill. However, when she wasn't ready, they raised their voice and left. While being late is impolite, the response of leaving without her could be seen as abandoning her, even if they intended to meet later. The yelling adds to the conflict. \n\nThe user might argue that they were respecting the wedding guests by being on time, but leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home could cause her emotional distress. Also, the user's frustration leading to yelling might have been unkind, even if the situation was tense. \n\nIn relationships, communication and support are crucial. Even if Jill is at fault for not managing time, the user's method of handling it might have been harsh. The user could have waited a bit longer, offered help, or found a compromise instead of leaving abruptly. \n\nSo, while there are valid points on both sides, the user's actions\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a relationship where support is expected. Therefore, the user might share some responsibility.\n"
