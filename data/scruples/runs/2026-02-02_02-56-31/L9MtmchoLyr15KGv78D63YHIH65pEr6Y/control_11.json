Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author set a clear deadline (3:45 PM) to leave by so they wouldn't be late. They warned Jill multiple times, even suggesting she start her preparations early. Jill didn't take their advice, and when the time came, she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to be responsible and respectful to the event's timing. They communicated their expectations clearly. However, when things didn't go as planned, they reacted emotionally by yelling and leaving. That reaction could be seen as harsh, especially since they were in a relationship where they presumably should support each other. \n\nJill's perspective is that she wasn't prepared, maybe she faced unexpected delays with the laundry. She might feel that the author didn't account for the fact that the clothes were only slightly dry, implying she might have tried but it didn't work out. Her being defensive could stem from feeling unappreciated or not supported.\n\nThe key points here are communication and the reaction. The author had valid concerns about being on time, but their response (yelling and leaving) might have been too severe. Leaving a partner behind in a stressful situation could cause emotional harm. Relationships require understanding and patience. Even if Jill is at fault for not managing her time, the author's decision to leave might have been an overreaction. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that Jill is usually kind and thoughtful, so maybe this situation is an exception. But the author's actions, while trying to be responsible, might have crossed a line. They should have handled the frustration better, perhaps by trying to problem-solve together instead of leaving. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for their reaction, even if the situation was frustrating. The answer depends on whether the action of leaving was disproportionate to the situation. Since they did raise their voice and left, which caused Jill to be upset, it's possible the author is at fault for not handling the stress more constructively.\n"
