Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM. The author told Jill at 1:30 PM that they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, her clothes were damp and she wasn't ready. The author got upset, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, meeting the wedding party there. Jill is upset, feeling the author was impatient, made promises about the laundry, and was mean.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author set a deadline (3:45) based on the timing needed. Jill didn't meet that, leading to the author leaving. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to communicate the time constraints multiple times. They set a clear deadline, and when it wasn't met, they followed through to avoid being late. That seems responsible, especially since they value punctuality. The author also mentions that this is a recurring issue, so maybe they felt justified in taking action.\n\nOn the other hand, raising their voice could be seen as being harsh, especially in a stressful situation. Yelling might escalate tensions. Also, the author's frustration might have been valid, but the way they handled it could be problematic. However, they did wait until 4:00 before leaving, giving an extra 15 minutes beyond the deadline they set.\n\nJill's perspective is that she's being defensive. But maybe she's also stressed about not being ready. The author made a comment about the laundry being dry, which might have been a miscommunication. If they told her the clothes would be dry by then, but they weren't, that's a point against the author. But if the author just said \"probably,\" then it's Jill's responsibility if they didn't get done.\n\nOverall, the author tried to communicate clearly and set expectations. When those weren't met, they took action to meet obligations. While the yelling was unideal, the main issue was Jill not meeting the agreed time. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
