Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, which was 30 minutes away. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest to be on time. Jill said she'd be ready, but when 3:45 PM came, she was still not ready, her clothes were slightly damp (from laundry mentioned earlier), and she was naked. The author got upset, raised his voice, waited until 4:00 PM, then left without her, saying he'd meet her there. Now, Jill is upset, feeling he was impatient, didn't account for the laundry not drying, and was mean by yelling.\n\nThe author thinks Jill is being defensive because she knows she's wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The key points here are communication, expectations, and actions taken. The author had previously warned Jill that they needed to leave by 3:45 PM. He even mentioned the laundry and the time it would take. Jill, however, said she'd be fine, which turned out not to be the case. When the time came, she wasn't ready, leading the author to leave. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, getting angry and raising his voice might be a problem. Yelling is generally considered disrespectful, regardless of the situation. However, the main issue here is leaving her at home. Was that his right to do? If the wedding was important and being on time was a priority, maybe he felt he had no choice. But leaving her alone in that state (naked, clothes damp) might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill had been warned multiple times about the time management. If she made a mistake in estimating how long she'd take, the author might have felt justified in making a choice to get to the wedding on time. However, leaving her in that state could be seen as abandonment. \n\nAlso, the fact that they are engaged and have discussed time management issues before suggests that communication was an ongoing problem. The author's frustration might be valid, but his method of handling it (yelling and leaving) could be seen as harsh. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might have acted out of frustration but in a way that was hurtful. Jill's reaction is about feeling unprepared for and not supported, but she also did make a mistake in time management. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because, while Jill made a mistake, the author's response (yelling and leaving her in an undressed state) was inappropriate. However, there's a nuance here. If the author's primary goal was to be on time and he had given clear warnings, maybe there's some justification. But the way he handled it, including raising his voice and leaving her in that state, is problematic. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's more to consider. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key factors are: did he have a right to leave her? If the wedding was important and they were going to be late, maybe he felt he had to leave to not be late. But leaving her alone, especially in that state, is definitely inconsiderate. Also, the yelling. So, while Jill made a mistake, the author's actions were also inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
