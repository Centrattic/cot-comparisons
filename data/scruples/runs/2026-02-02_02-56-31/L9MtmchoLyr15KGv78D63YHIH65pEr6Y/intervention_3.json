Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. They agreed to leave by 3:45, but Jill wasn't ready by then, so the user left her at 4:00.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the communication between them. The user mentioned that Jill isn't good at budgeting time and they often get into situations like this. The user had given a heads-up about the 3:45 departure time, and Jill assured them she'd be fine. However, the user was frustrated because this is a recurring issue, leading to stress.\n\nThe user raised their voice in frustration, which led to Jill feeling yelled at. Then, the user left after waiting until 4:00, which makes Jill upset because she feels the user is impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would dry on time, and was mean. The user argues that Jill knows she's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the user is concerned about punctuality and respecting others' time. They might feel that being on time is important and that leaving without Jill was necessary to not be late. On the other hand, leaving a partner in a vulnerable state (naked) might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the user is frustrated. Also, raising their voice could be seen as a loss of control, which can hurt feelings regardless of the situation.\n\nIt's important to consider the context of their relationship. They are engaged, so communication and understanding are crucial. The user's frustration with a recurring issue might justify some stress, but how they handled the situation could be the problem. Leaving Jill alone after a tense moment might have been a reaction to stress but could also be seen as abandoning her in a difficult moment.\n\nThe user might not be entirely in the wrong because they tried to plan ahead and give warnings. However, the method they used\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might have been excessive. There could have been a more constructive way to handle the situation, like discussing the problem calmly after the event or helping Jill get ready instead of leaving. The key points are communication, the use of raised voice, and leaving an unprepared partner.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intention to be punctual is understandable, their response to the situation might have been too harsh. They might share some responsibility for not managing their frustration better and not considering Jill's feelings in that moment. So, the answer might lean towards the user being partially in the wrong.\n"
