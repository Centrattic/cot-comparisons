Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The main issue is about time management and expectations. The fianc\u00e9, let's call him John, wants to be punctual and values showing up on time as respectful. Jill, on the other hand, has a history of poor time management and often causes them to be late. In this specific instance, they had agreed that they needed to leave by 3:45 PM for a 4:30 PM wedding. John gave a heads-up about the time, but Jill wasn't ready by then. She was still getting dressed, her clothes were slightly damp from the dryer, and he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM, telling her he would meet her there.\n\nNow, the question is whether John is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, John's frustration is understandable. He values punctuality and has had repeated issues with Jill being late. He tried to set expectations by reminding her about the time and the need to leave by 3:45. He even gave her a heads-up to start her preparations. When she didn't meet the deadline, he made a choice to leave to avoid being late to the wedding. His reasoning is that he didn't want to walk in during the aisle procession, which is a significant part of the event. \n\nOn the other hand, leaving Jill at home might be seen as abandonment in an emotional context. Even if she was at fault for not being ready, John's decision to leave could be seen as not supporting her. Additionally, he raised his voice, which is a form of yelling and could be considered disrespectful. Even if he was frustrated, yelling can hurt and escalate tensions. \n\nAnother angle is communication. John might have expected clear communication from Jill about her progress. However, Jill might feel that she was doing her best and that the drying time was uncertain. She might have thought the clothes would be dry by the time they needed to leave, but the dryer settings or the load could have caused them to still be damp. \n\nAlso, the fact that they were going to a wedding, which is a formal event, might mean there's an expectation of mutual support. John left without her, which could be seen as not standing by her. Even if she was responsible for her time management, the act of leaving her behind might be seen as callous. \n\nHowever, John's intention was to maintain punctuality, which he sees as a sign of respect to the hosts and other guests. He might believe that waiting longer would make them miss a key part of the event. His frustration led to an emotional outburst, but he did try to communicate the time constraints in advance.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties could have handled the situation better. Jill could have checked the dryer earlier or communicated that she might be late. John could have tried to wait a bit longer or found another solution, like calling someone for help or adjusting their schedule more flexibly. \n\nThe key factors here are whether John's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Leaving Jill might be seen as inconsiderate because it left her in an awkward position, potentially embarrassed or stressed. Even if she was at fault, the act of abandoning her could be hurtful. The yelling adds another layer of conflict, as it shows a lack of control in his frustration. \n\nIn summary, while Jill's poor time management is a problem, John's response\u2014raising his voice and leaving her\u2014might be seen as overreacting and not considering her feelings. The fact that he left her at home could be viewed as inconsiderate, especially if she ended up going to the wedding alone, which could be embarrassing. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because his actions, although frustrated by her behavior, could be seen as not supportive and disrespectful in their execution.\n"
