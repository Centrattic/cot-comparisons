Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. They had a prior conversation where the author set a time to leave, but Jill didn't get ready on time. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author tried to set a clear time (3:45) to leave to avoid being late, which Jill agreed to. However, Jill didn't manage her time properly and wasn't ready by then. The author, frustrated, left her at home. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because the author raised their voice and didn't help her finish getting ready.\n\nNow, considering the elements of responsibility. Time management issues are on Jill's side. The author tried to plan ahead, set a deadline, and gave a reminder. But when things went wrong, the author's reaction included yelling, which is a problem. Yelling can be seen as aggressive and disrespectful, regardless of the situation. Also, leaving Jill at home might have been a hasty decision, especially since they were going to a public event together. The author might have had a point about being late, but the method of handling it is questionable.\n\nThe author's main argument is that Jill knew she had to start early, so she's responsible. But in a relationship, sometimes you have to support each other even when things go wrong. The author could have stayed and helped her finish getting ready instead of leaving. Leaving her alone could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry). That's a safety and emotional issue. Also, raising their voice is a sign of poor conflict management.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill's poor time management led to the problem. She didn't take the advice seriously. But even so, the author's response was to yell and leave, which isn't constructive. The author's action of leaving might have been an overreaction, even if the frustration was justified. In a close relationship, communication and support are key. The author could have handled it differently, like staying and helping her get ready quickly, or at least being more understanding instead of getting angry.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. While Jill's time management is her fault, the author's use of yelling and leaving her in that state is problematic. Relationships require mutual support, and the author's actions could be seen as selfish or not considering Jill's needs in the moment. The key here is that even if Jill is at fault for being unprepared, the author's response was not appropriate. Therefore, the author does share some responsibility for their actions, making them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
