Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the background: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management, leading to frequent lateness. The couple had a conversation early in the day about the laundry and the need to leave by 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding. The user warned Jill to start getting ready in time. When 3:45 hits, Jill isn't ready, her clothes are slightly damp, and the user gets frustrated. They raise their voice and leave at 4:00, meeting her there. Jill is upset, feeling the user was impatient and blamed her.\n\nNow, considering the user's actions. They did warn Jill multiple times. They set a clear departure time. However, when the time came and Jill wasn't ready, the user raised their voice, which could be seen as yelling. Then they left her at home. \n\nLeaving someone at home might seem extreme, but the user's reasoning was to avoid being late to the wedding. However, the method of handling the situation is questionable. Raising their voice adds to the conflict. While time management is an issue on Jill's side, the user could have handled it differently\u2014maybe tried to help her get ready instead of leaving. \n\nBut the user also has a point about being punctual and respecting others' time. However, the conflict here is between the user's need for punctuality and Jill's time management issues. The user's frustration led to an emotional response (yelling) and an action (leaving her) that caused hurt feelings. \n\nIn relationships, communication and handling stress are important. Even if Jill is at fault for not getting ready on time, the user's reaction might have been harsh. The user could have taken a different approach, like staying and helping, even if they were upset. \n\nSo, while Jill's behavior contributed to the problem, the user's response might have been too harsh. The yelling and leaving alone could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they're engaged and should support each other. Therefore, the user might share some responsibility here.\n"
