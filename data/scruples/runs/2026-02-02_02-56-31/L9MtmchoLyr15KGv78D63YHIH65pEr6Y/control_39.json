Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let's look at the details provided.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They have this recurring issue where they're often late or the author gets stressed about being late. The author values punctuality and considers it rude to be late. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. The author reminded Jill at 1:30 that they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 hit, she wasn't ready. The author waited until 4:00, got frustrated, yelled, and left her.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, Jill is being defensive and knows she's in the wrong. The author left to avoid being late to the wedding, which is a significant event. But the fianc\u00e9e is upset because the author yelled, said the clothes would dry (but they were slightly damp), and called her impatient.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author did mention leaving because they didn't want to be late, which is understandable. However, yelling and leaving a fianc\u00e9e behind, even if the other person is at fault, could be seen as harsh. The author might have handled it differently, like waiting a bit longer or helping Jill get ready instead of leaving. Also, the author assumed the clothes would be dry, but Jill's clothes were only slightly damp, which might mean the author made a mistake in that assumption. \n\nRelationship dynamics matter here. Leaving someone alone at home when they're still in the process of getting ready could be hurtful. Even if Jill was late, the author's actions might have caused emotional distress. On the other hand, Jill's consistent time management issues are part of the problem, and the author had a valid concern about being on time.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong? The key points are the raised voice and the decision to leave. Yelling is typically considered disrespectful, regardless of the situation. Leaving without any prior agreement might also be problematic. In a relationship, communication and support are crucial. The author might have been justified in wanting to be punctual but handled it poorly. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might share some responsibility. While Jill's lateness is an issue, the author's response was reactive and not collaborative. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if Jill was also at fault for not being ready on time.\n"
