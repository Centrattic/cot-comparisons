Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e, Jill, who isn't good with time management, leading to the author leaving her at home before a wedding. \n\nFirst, the author tried to remind Jill about the time multiple times. He told her to start early so their clothes would dry. Jill said she'd be fine, but then wasn't ready by the 3:45 deadline. The author got upset, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, leading to Jill being upset.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author was trying to be punctual, which is respectful to others. But he did raise his voice, which could be seen as yelling. Leaving Jill alone might not be the best solution, but she was the one who didn't follow through on the agreed plan.\n\nHowever, the fact that he left her might make her feel abandoned, even if she was responsible. But he did give her a clear deadline and she ignored it. The author's actions were driven by frustration. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe both are at fault. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he did get angry and left, maybe that's not the best approach. But considering Jill's repeated issues with time management, perhaps the author had valid reasons.\n\nBut leaving her home alone instead of waiting might be seen as abandoning her. However, he did say he'd meet her there. It's a bit of a conflict between respecting commitments and handling stress. \n\nI think the author made a mistake in raising his voice, but leaving might not be entirely his fault. Still, he could have handled it better. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author left her there, maybe he's partly at fault. But Jill's repeated time issues also contributed. \n\nThe answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he left her, but maybe B (not in the wrong) because Jill was at fault. I need to decide based on the scenario. The key points: he gave warnings, she ignored them, he got frustrated. Leaving her might be harsh, but he's not entirely wrong. Hmm. The community might see both sides but lean towards AITA being the author. Or maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural norms and expectations. If you leave your fianc\u00e9e before an event because she's unprepared, that's a big deal. But if she's responsible for her time management, maybe he's not wrong. However, yelling and leaving could be seen as overreacting. So maybe A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he escalated the situation by yelling and leaving, even if she was at fault. Both have some responsibility, but the question is about the author's fault. So answer A or B?\n\nI think the answer is A. Because even though Jill was late, the author's reaction of yelling and leaving might be considered over the top. He could have waited a bit longer or handled it differently. So he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
