Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home when they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had discussed leaving by 3:45, but she wasn't ready until later, with clothes slightly damp. The user got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her to get to the wedding on time. Now, Jill is upset, feeling that the user was impatient, didn't ensure the laundry was dry, and was mean.\n\nThe user thinks Jill is being defensive because she knows she's wrong. They argue that being on time is important and that they gave her a heads up about the deadline.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The user did set a clear time to leave, which is reasonable. Jill didn't meet that time, which is where the conflict arises. The user got frustrated and raised their voice. Even if Jill was responsible for her lateness, the user's reaction of yelling and leaving could be seen as harsh, especially since she was still getting ready. Leaving her behind might have been a last resort because they didn't want to be late, but it could come off as inconsiderate. Weddings are important, but so is respecting each other's feelings. The user might not be entirely in the wrong if they communicated clearly and tried to be on time, but their reaction might have been too harsh, contributing to the problem. Both sides have some responsibility: Jill for time management and the user for how they handled the frustration. So, maybe the user is partially at fault, but not entirely. The answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because of the yelling and leaving her alone, but I need to consider cultural or social norms around being on time versus being considerate in relationships. In some contexts, being on time is a big deal, but in a relationship, communication and empathy are key. The user's approach might have been too abrupt. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
