Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did the right thing by leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation is a common one where time management is an issue.\n\nFirst, the user (let's call him Alex for clarity) tried to communicate the importance of leaving on time. He mentioned the wedding starting at 4:30 and gave a strict deadline of 3:45. Jill said she could be ready by then, but she wasn't. He got frustrated and left her at home. \n\nSo, the main points here are communication and actions. Did Alex handle this appropriately? He did warn her multiple times. He tried to help by doing the laundry. But when she wasn't ready on time, he left. The problem is that he raised his voice, which could be seen as yelling. That's a point against him. But he also had a valid reason to be on time for the wedding.\n\nHowever, leaving her naked and not ready is a problem. He might have acted out of frustration, but taking off in the middle of the situation could be seen as abandoning her. Even if he's right about being on time, the way he handled it might have been harsh. \n\nJill's reaction is about feeling defensive because she knows she's late, but she's upset about being yelled at and not being ready. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but maybe both sides have responsibilities here. \n\nIn relationships, communication and support are key. Even if one person is late, the other's reaction matters. Raising your voice can escalate the situation. On the other hand, Jill should have managed her time better as per the initial warnings. \n\nSo, is Alex in the wrong? He might be partly responsible for yelling and leaving her behind, but Jill also didn't meet the agreed-upon deadline. It's a mix. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he left her there, which is a big issue, the answer might lean towards AITA (answering A: Yes, he's in the wrong). Because even if she's partly to blame, the act of leaving her in that state and the yelling are not ideal. \n\nBut some might say he's not in the wrong because he tried to communicate and she didn't follow through. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer is A, considering the yelling and the action of leaving her there, but it's a nuanced situation. The user's frustration is valid, but the execution was poor.\n"
