Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves time management issues and a conflict over being on time.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The user (let's call him John) mentions that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with budgeting time, which leads to them often being late. He values punctuality and finds it rude to be late. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. They discussed leaving by 3:45, but she wasn't ready by then. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home.\n\nJill is upset because he was impatient, told her the clothes would dry, and was mean. John thinks she's in the wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did John handle the situation appropriately? Leaving a partner at home because they're not ready could be seen as abandoning her, which is not helpful. But he was trying to be on time. However, raising his voice and leaving without ensuring her safety might be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's behavior of not being ready on time is an issue, but John's response was to leave her, which could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate. Even if she's at fault for being unprepared, leaving her might not be the right solution. Also, telling her the clothes would dry when they might not have\u2014maybe he should have been more proactive in checking or helping her get ready instead of just leaving. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe John should have tried to help her get ready instead of giving up and leaving. Yelling adds emotional harm, which complicates things. So even if Jill is responsible for not being ready, John's actions (leaving her and yelling) might be in the wrong. \n\nBut then again, the user argues he was being the responsible one. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and relationship dynamics. However, generally, leaving someone behind in such a situation might not be the best approach. So, likely, the answer is A\u2014John is in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where both have some responsibility. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he left her and raised his voice, those actions are problematic, so the answer is probably A.\n"
