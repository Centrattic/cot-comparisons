Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting her time, which leads to them being late often. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30 PM. The author, let's call him Will, told her they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. But when 3:45 PM came, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp from the laundry, and she was still naked. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home, saying he'd meet her there.\n\nNow, the key points here: Will gave a clear deadline (3:45 PM) and Jill didn't meet it. He waited until 4:00 PM, which is 15 minutes past the deadline. He got angry, yelled, and left. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and was mean.\n\nTo determine if Will is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, Will set a clear time to leave to be punctual, which is reasonable. He waited an extra 15 minutes, which shows some patience. Jill's repeated issue with time management might be the root cause here. He might have felt that waiting longer would make them miss the ceremony, especially if they're trying to arrive on time for the start at 4:30 PM. Leaving to attend the event without her could be seen as prioritizing punctuality and avoiding being a burden on the hosts.\n\nOn the other hand, leaving her at home might be seen as abandonment, even if it's a wedding. Raising his voice and yelling could be considered disrespectful or harsh, even if he was frustrated. Also, maybe not giving her enough time to finish drying her clothes was a miscalculation. However, he did set the time in advance. The fact that Jill was aware of the deadline but didn't meet it might mean that the problem is more on her side.\n\nThe main conflict here is between Will's need for punctuality and Jill's tendency to be late. Will tried to set a clear expectation, but Jill didn't meet it. His reaction of leaving could be a result of frustration from previous instances where she didn't manage her time. However, leaving her alone and yelling could be seen as mean, even if he's right about the time issue.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action taken was proportionate to the situation. Will's action of leaving might be seen as extreme, especially since they're engaged and the issue is about time management. But considering the context of repeated issues, maybe his frustration is understandable. The question is whether his response was the right way to handle it. \n\nHe might have handled it better by trying to communicate more effectively, like waiting a bit longer with a calm reminder or discussing the time management issue without raising his voice. But the fact that he left her might not be the worst thing, especially if the wedding was important and he wanted to avoid being late. However, leaving her alone could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the reason is time management.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author might be in the wrong because he left his fianc\u00e9e alone at home, which is a significant action, and yelling was inappropriate. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the author's response might be seen as harsh. The community often considers the emotional impact as well. So, the answer might be A (Yes, author is in the wrong) because of the way he handled the situation, despite the underlying issue being Jill's time management.\n"
