Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home when they were going to be late to a wedding. They had a conversation earlier about timing, and the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, wasn't ready on time. The user raised their voice and left her. Now, Jill is upset, saying they were impatient and mean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user was concerned about being late, which they see as disrespectful. They set a departure time, but Jill didn't meet it. However, the user raised their voice, which can be seen as yelling, even if it was in frustration. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about being left and feeling disrespected. \n\nThe user's actions: They did warn Jill about the time and the laundry. But maybe they assumed she could manage her time better. When she didn't, they left without her. The problem here is that even if Jill was late, abandoning her could cause her distress. Also, raising their voice adds to the tension.\n\nJill's side: She might have underestimated the time needed for her hair and makeup, or maybe the laundry didn't dry as expected. Her being \"naked\" suggests she was still getting ready, which could be a sensitive moment. The user left her in a vulnerable state, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nNow, considering the context of their relationship, they mentioned they usually get along well. This situation might be a recurring issue with time management. The user's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014could be seen as harsh. \n\nIs the user at fault? They did act out of frustration, which isn't ideal. However, their intention was to make the wedding on time. But leaving their partner alone in an unready state might be inconsiderate. Also, the yelling adds to the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's time management issues contributed to the situation. But in a relationship, communication and support are key. The user's approach might have been too abrupt. Instead of leaving, maybe they could have tried to help her get ready or communicated more calmly.\n\nSo, the user's actions were partly in response to Jill's behavior, but their reaction was excessive. They might not be entirely at fault, but they did overreact. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is also valid because being left alone and yelled at can be hurtful. \n\nI think the answer is a mix. The user did act inconsiderately by leaving and raising their voice, so they share some responsibility. However, Jill's time management issues also play a role. But since the question is whether the user is in the wrong, the answer is likely A (Yes), because their actions caused harm regardless of the circumstances. However, sometimes these scenarios are seen as both at fault. But given the options, the user's actions crossed a line, so they are in the wrong.\n"
