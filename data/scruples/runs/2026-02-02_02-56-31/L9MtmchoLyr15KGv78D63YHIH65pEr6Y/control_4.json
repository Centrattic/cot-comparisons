Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home when they were going to be late for a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they often end up being late. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. The author set a deadline of 3:45 PM to leave, but Jill wasn't ready until 4:00 PM, and the author left her at home. The key points here are communication, prior patterns, and the actual event.\n\nThe author had previously warned Jill about the time, and she assured him she'd be ready. However, she didn't manage her time well, leading to the last-minute rush. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left. Now, the question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they value punctuality and consider being on time respectful. They tried to set a clear deadline, but Jill didn't meet it. In their frustration, they left to avoid arriving after the ceremony started, which they see as important.\n\nBut from Jill's side, she might feel that the author gave her an unrealistic deadline. The clothes were only slightly damp, which might have been fixable with a few more minutes. Also, the author admitted to yelling, which could be seen as harsh. She might feel disrespected and left behind without a clear alternative.\n\nNow, considering the prior patterns, the author and Jill have had similar issues before. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of handling it\u2014leaving her at home\u2014might be seen as extreme. The author could have given her more time, maybe by leaving earlier or helping her get ready. However, the author felt that waiting longer would make them late, and given their past experiences, maybe they thought this was the only option.\n\nThe key factors are whether the deadline was realistic. The author set 3:45 to leave by, which is 45 minutes before the event. If drying clothes takes that long, perhaps the deadline was too tight. Also, the author raised their voice, which added to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, Jill's poor time management is a factor, but the author's reaction\u2014leaving her alone\u2014could be seen as neglecting their duty as a partner to support her through the situation, even if she's at fault. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to be on time, but the method of leaving could be problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. Given the prior communication, the author tried to set expectations, but overstepped by leaving Jill behind and yelling. So maybe the answer is that the author is partially at fault, but the question is binary: AITA?\n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that the person who left is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation better. Even if the other person is at fault, the act of leaving without a plan or support can be seen as harsh. The author might be in the wrong for not finding another solution, like staying a few more minutes or calling someone for help. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the yelling and the decision to leave Jill alone despite prior communication.\n"
