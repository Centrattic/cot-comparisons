Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready in time for a wedding. They had discussed leaving at 3:45, but she wasn't ready by then, so he left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, might have a habit of poor time management, which causes them to be late often. The user is frustrated with being late and views punctuality as respectful. He gave a heads-up about the time, and Jill said she'd be fine. When she wasn't ready, he got upset and left.\n\nBut wait, when he said the laundry would probably be dry, maybe he was overconfident. If the clothes were slightly damp, maybe he should have known they wouldn't be dry in time. Also, he raised his voice, which is a red flag. Yelling can be hurtful even if the frustration is understandable. Leaving her at home might have been a reaction to stress, but it's not the best solution. \n\nJill might feel disrespected, especially if she trusted she'd be ready and he didn't support her. Communication is key here. Maybe instead of leaving, he could have tried to help her get ready or adjusted the timeline. However, the recurring issue of lateness is on her side. \n\nThe user's intention was to be on time, which is valid. But his method\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might have been harsh. It's a balance between personal responsibility and mutual support in a relationship. The user's frustration is understandable, but the action of leaving her could be seen as abandoning her, even if he felt it was necessary. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the user is partly at fault for his reaction and method, but Jill's consistent time issues also play a role. However, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since he left her, which caused hurt, and his reaction was angry, even if he had reasons, the answer might lean towards A. But maybe not entirely, since the underlying issue is Jill's time management. I'm a bit torn, but the immediate action of leaving without support might make him at fault.\n"
