Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they often end up late. He planned to leave by 3:45 to make it on time, but she wasn't ready until 4:00. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her. \n\nOn Jill's side, she might have underestimated the time needed for her hair and clothes to dry. Maybe she didn't realize how long it would take, even though the author had warned her. Her reaction is that he was impatient, didn't account for the laundry being slightly damp, and was mean by yelling. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author tried to set a clear deadline (3:45) and reminded her beforehand. However, he left the laundry's drying time to her judgment, which might have been a mistake. He also raised his voice, which is a loss of temper and could be seen as disrespectful, even if he was stressed about being on time. \n\nLeaving someone at home, especially on the way to a wedding, could be seen as abandoning them. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the author's response was to leave without ensuring she could get there safely or with an alternative plan. That might be considered harsh. \n\nBut the author also has a valid point about punctuality and respecting others' time. Weddings are important events, and showing up late can be disrespectful. He tried to manage time carefully and gave multiple warnings. \n\nHowever, the act of leaving without making sure Jill gets to the event might have been inconsiderate. Maybe a better approach would have been to stay and help her get ready, or call a taxi if they were going to be late. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author made a mistake by yelling and leaving, which could have been handled more calmly. But Jill also didn't meet the agreed-upon time. The question is whether the author's actions were in the wrong. Since he left her, which could be seen as abandoning her, and raised his voice, he's partially at fault. However, the situation involved mutual issues with time management and communication. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he could have handled the situation better without leaving. Leaving her alone in that situation might have been inconsiderate, even if she was late. There's no mention of ensuring her safety or alternative transport, which is important.\n"
