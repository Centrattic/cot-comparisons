Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, Jill (the fianc\u00e9e) has a history of poor time management. They've had similar conversations before, which suggests this isn't an isolated incident. The author warned her they needed to leave by 3:45 to avoid being late. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 came, she wasn't ready, clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, meeting the time they agreed upon.\n\nThe key points here: the author had given a clear warning and a deadline. Jill didn't meet that deadline despite being aware. The author left when she wasn't ready, which caused the fianc\u00e9e to be upset. The fianc\u00e9e is now accusing the author of being impatient and mean. The author argues that the fianc\u00e9e is in the wrong because she didn't prepare on time.\n\nBut wait, the author had set a firm time, which the fianc\u00e9e didn't meet. However, leaving the fianc\u00e9e there might have been a harsh response. Communicating the frustration by raising their voice could be seen as contributing to the problem. Also, abandoning someone before a public event might cause her embarrassment or stress. The author's intention was to be on time, which is understandable, but the method\u2014leaving without her\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThere's a balance between holding someone accountable and being supportive. While the fianc\u00e9e's time management is an issue, the author's reaction could have been handled better. Maybe waiting a bit longer or helping her get ready instead of leaving. However, the author did set a clear time and followed through when it wasn't respected. \n\nIn terms of accountability, both have some responsibility. The author's frustration is valid, but the action of leaving might be seen as harsh. However, the fianc\u00e9e's consistent poor time management is a recurring problem. So, depending on the perspective, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. But the way they handled it\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014could be problematic. \n\nMaybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they could have handled the situation better. Or B, because the fianc\u00e9e broke the agreement. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But considering the raised voice and leaving her alone, which could be seen as cruel, maybe A. Alternatively, if the author followed their own set time, maybe B. \n\nI think the key here is whether leaving was reasonable. If they had a plan to leave at 3:45 and the fianc\u00e9e didn't meet it, then the author might not be wrong. However, the yelling and leaving her there could be seen as inconsiderate. But the fianc\u00e9e's main issue is not meeting the time. The author's actions were a consequence of the fianc\u00e9e's failure to prepare. So maybe the author is not in the wrong (B), but the handling could be better. But the question is specifically about being in the wrong. Since the author set the time and followed through, perhaps B. But the emotional response (yelling) might tip it to A. Hmm. Need to decide between A and B based on the scenario. The user might lean towards A because of the raised voice and leaving her alone, but the author's intention was to be punctual. It's a tricky call. I'm leaning towards A because the method of leaving was harsh, even if the root issue is the fianc\u00e9e's fault. So answer A.\n"
