Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. They mention that Jill, their fianc\u00e9e, isn't good at time management, and they usually end up late. In this specific instance, they told her they needed to leave by 3:45 to make it on time, but she wasn't ready until later. The user raised their voice and left her at home to go to the wedding alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user was trying to be punctual and respectful to the event, which is important. They had given a clear deadline and tried to communicate early on. However, when things went south, they reacted with frustration, raised their voice, and left Jill behind. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill might have known her own habits and should have started earlier. If she had been aware of the time constraints, she might have managed it better. But the user's reaction\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially in a relationship. Even if the user felt justified, the way they handled it might have hurt Jill's feelings. \n\nThe user points out that Jill is defensive, which could mean she's aware that she was late. But the user's actions\u2014leaving her alone and yelling\u2014might have been unnecessary. Relationships require communication and understanding. Maybe there's a better way to handle such situations without emotional outbursts. \n\nAlso, considering the event was a wedding, punctuality is a social norm. However, the user's frustration led to a conflict. It's possible that both parties could have approached this more calmly. The user could have tried to find a compromise instead of leaving. Jill could have been more proactive in managing her time. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, it's a bit of a shared responsibility. But the user's action of leaving Jill alone and raising their voice could be seen as the immediate wrongdoing, even if Jill's time management was an issue. The user should reflect on whether their reaction was proportionate. Maybe there's room for both to improve: the user could work on handling stress better, and Jill on time management. But given the situation, the user might be in the wrong for their reaction, even if the root cause was Jill's lateness. However, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. In some contexts, leaving a partner might be seen as harsh, but in others, respecting commitments might be prioritized. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the user being in the wrong because of the yelling and leaving, even if Jill had a part in it.\n"
