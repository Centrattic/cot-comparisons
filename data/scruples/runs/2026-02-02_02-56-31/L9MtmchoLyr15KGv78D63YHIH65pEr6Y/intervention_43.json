Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves previous time management issues, communication, and a raised voice.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, which they've had issues with before. They set a deadline (3:45) and gave a heads-up. When the time came, she wasn't ready, clothes were slightly damp, and he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left by 4:00. Now she's upset, saying he was impatient, didn't ensure clothes were dry, and was mean.\n\nThe key points here are communication, expectations, and conflict resolution. The user set a clear time, but maybe didn't check in again later. Raising his voice in frustration is a red flag\u2014it's important to handle stress without yelling. Leaving her alone might have been a reaction to stress, but it's also a hurtful action. Jill's reaction is about feeling disrespected and unprepared for the logistics.\n\nHe might think he's right because she wasn't ready on time, but he could have handled the situation differently. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe he could have calmly discussed the situation, offered help, or adjusted the plan. The fact that he left her alone could be seen as abandonment, especially in a stressful moment. His frustration is understandable, but the way he reacted might have exacerbated the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's responsibility to manage her time is part of the equation. However, communication is a two-way street. Both might share some responsibility, but the user's actions crossed into being hurtful with the yelling and leaving. So while he might not be entirely at fault, he's probably in the wrong for how he handled the situation.\n"
