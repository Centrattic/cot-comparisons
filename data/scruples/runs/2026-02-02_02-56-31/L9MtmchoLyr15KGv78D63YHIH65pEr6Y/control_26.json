Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before a wedding. \n\nFirst, context is important. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they need to leave by 3:45 to arrive on time. The author gives a heads-up about the time, and Jill says she'll be ready. But when 3:45 hits, she's still not ready, clothes are damp, and he gets frustrated. He yells at her and leaves by 4:00.\n\nSo, the key points here: communication. The author warned Jill about the time, and she assured him she'd be ready. But she didn't account for the laundry properly. He got upset and raised his voice, which is a problem. Then he left her behind. \n\nHe argues that she's being defensive because she's in the wrong. But from Jill's perspective, maybe she felt rushed, or maybe there were other things going on. The fact that he yelled at her is a red flag. Yelling is not okay regardless of the situation. Also, leaving her there might have been a way to hold her accountable, but it's not helpful and could be seen as harsh. \n\nHowever, the author was trying to be punctual and respectful to others. But his reaction (yelling and leaving) might have been an overreaction. Maybe he should have handled it differently, like setting a time limit earlier or helping her get ready instead of just getting frustrated. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill didn't take the advice seriously. She said she'd be ready but wasn't. So both have some responsibility. The author's intention was good, but his method was poor. \n\nIn terms of fault, maybe it's a shared responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he raised his voice and left her, which could be seen as abandonment or lack of support, that's a negative. However, he was trying to manage time, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut the main issue here is how he handled it. Yelling and leaving, especially when she was still in the process, shows a lack of communication and support. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the raised voice and leaving her, even if the underlying issue had elements of Jill's time management.\n"
