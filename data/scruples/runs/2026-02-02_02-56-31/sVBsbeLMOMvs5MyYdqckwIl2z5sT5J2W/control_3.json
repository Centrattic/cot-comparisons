      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender after the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. So, first, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected, and sometimes a standard percentage is added automatically. The author was at a club with friends, invited four of them, and when paying, the bartender added 20% without saying anything.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice this. They decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them further if they didn't tip. The key points here are: the bartender added the tip without informing the customer, the customer's reaction, and the bartender's response.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the bartender's action of adding a tip without informing the customer might be questionable. Some places do add gratuity automatically, but it's usually disclosed. If the bartender didn't explain, that could be a problem. The customer's right to know how their money is being handled is important. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer chose to tip 0%, which is a valid response if they felt the automatic tip was unfair. However, in many service industries, not tipping at all might be seen as poor etiquette. The author might argue they were standing up for themselves against an unexpected charge, while the bartender might have felt it's part of the expected service.\n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is problematic because it could be seen as coercion. However, the customer's initial decision to not tip after the automatic addition might be their choice, but is it justified? \n\nThe ethical angle here is about mutual respect. The customer has the right to control their own tipping, and the bartender shouldn't impose a tip without consent. However, the customer's zero tip might be seen as harsh, but if the bartender's action was deceptive, the customer's reaction could be justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender added the tip without consent, leading to the customer's justified refusal. The bartender's refusal to serve could be the bigger issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
