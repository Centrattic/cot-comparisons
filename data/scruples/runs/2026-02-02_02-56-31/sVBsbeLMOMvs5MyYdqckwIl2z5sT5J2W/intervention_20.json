      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought them drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user got drunk and felt the bartender was trying to take advantage by adding the tip automatically. They then left a 0% tip, leading to the bartender threatening not to serve them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service staff around 15-20%. However, the key issue here is the bartender adding the tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, tipping is the customer's choice, and while some places might automatically add a tip, it's usually disclosed upfront. The user was upset because the bartender did this without informing them, which could be seen as deceptive.\n\nThe user was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's actions. Their response was to tip 0%, which the bartender saw as taking advantage. The user's reasoning was that they wanted to tip themselves appropriately but were upset about the automatic addition. The bartender, on the other hand, might have had a policy or expected a standard tip, leading to the conflict.\n\nNow, whether the user is in the wrong. If tipping is standard, not tipping at all could be considered rude. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission might have been the initial issue. The user's response was to withhold the tip entirely, which might be seen as retaliatory. But maybe they felt justified because the bartender tried to take advantage. However, the user could have simply paid the actual amount without adding the tip, but instead left 0%, which might have been harsher than necessary.\n\nIn some places, not tipping at all is considered very poor etiquette. The bartender's threat to not serve them again if they don't tip might be an overreaction, but he has the right to refuse service. However, the user's action was in response to the bartender's unauthorized tip, which complicates things.\n\nSo, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't tip at all, which is generally expected, even if the bartender made a mistake. Alternatively, the bartender was wrong to add the tip without permission. The user should have probably addressed the tip issue politely, perhaps by removing the automatic tip and then deciding their own amount. Instead, leaving 0% without explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. But since the user was drunk, that might affect their judgment. However, being drunk doesn't excuse poor behavior either.\n\nIn conclusion, both parties have some fault, but the user's decision to leave 0% might cross into being inconsiderate, even if they felt the bartender was wrong. So the answer might be AITA, but the user is in the wrong (A) because not tipping is generally frowned upon, even if the bartender made a mistake. However, if the bartender's action was a policy, maybe the user isn't entirely wrong. But since the user chose to tip 0%, which is against the norm, they might be in the wrong.\n"
