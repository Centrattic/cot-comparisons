      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The person went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person, being a bit drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is customary and often expected. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. The user might argue that the bartender added the tip without their knowledge, which could be seen as deceptive. However, in some establishments, a service charge is automatically added, but it's usually disclosed beforehand. If the bartender added a tip without mentioning it, that's a problem. \n\nBut then the user reacted by not tipping at all, which could be seen as retaliatory. The bartender's response to not serve them if they don't tip might be his way of enforcing a policy, but it's also possible he overstepped. \n\nThe user's main issue is the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent. If the tip was supposed to be optional, the bartender shouldn't have done that. However, the user's response of 0% might be excessive. Maybe a better approach would be to tip a lower amount or question the addition politely. \n\nConsidering all factors, the user's action was a response to the bartender's possibly deceptive practice, but retaliating with a 0% tip might not be the best approach. The bartender's refusal to serve could be a policy issue. So, the user isn't entirely in the wrong, but neither is the bartender. However, the answer here is about whether the user is at fault. Since the bartender's initial action was wrong, the user's response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, is a reaction to that. So, maybe the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
