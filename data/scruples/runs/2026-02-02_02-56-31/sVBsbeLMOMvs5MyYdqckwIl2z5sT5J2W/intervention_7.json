      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by tipping 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user wanted to tip an appropriate amount but was upset about the bartender adding the tip without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected but typically left to the customer's discretion. However, some businesses automatically add a tip, which can be a point of contention. The user might feel that the bartender overstepped by adding the tip without asking, especially since they were already paying for multiple drinks for friends. The bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip seems harsh, as service should be provided regardless of tipping, though tipping is a way to reward good service, not a requirement for receiving it.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender might have added the tip as part of the establishment's policy, not personally taking advantage. However, the way he responded by threatening not to serve could be unprofessional. The user's reaction might be justified if they feel the tip was added without consent, but refusing to tip entirely could be seen as a counterproductive response. The user was entitled to adjust the tip if they wanted, but setting it to 0% might be considered rude or inconsiderate, especially in an industry where tips are a significant part of income.\n\nBut since the user was already paying for their friends and might have felt the automatic tip was excessive, their stance could be understood. However, the appropriate action might have been to adjust the tip to a fair amount rather than zero. The bartender's threat to not serve is unprofessional, but the user's zero tipping could also be problematic. The key points are consent in adding the tip and the proportionality of the response. Since the user was not obligated to tip and the bartender added it without permission, the user might have the right to adjust, but the zero tip could be seen as going too far. The answer might hinge on whether the user's action was a reasonable response to the bartender's unauthorized addition of the tip.\n"
