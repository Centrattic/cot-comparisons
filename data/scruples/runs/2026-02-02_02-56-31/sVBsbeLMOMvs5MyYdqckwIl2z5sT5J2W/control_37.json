      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author was drunk but not so much that they didn't notice. They responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author wanted to tip an appropriate amount but was upset about the bartender adding the tip without asking.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers, and sometimes it's even expected. However, the bartender added the tip without asking, which might be an issue. Usually, when you pay with a card, the terminal might let you add a tip, but if the bartender manually added it without informing, that could be problematic. \n\nThe author was drunk but not to the point of not knowing what was happening. So they did notice the bartender adding the tip. The author's response was to leave 0%, which the bartender found unacceptable. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk patrons. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong here? If the bartender is supposed to let the customer decide the tip, adding it without consent might be the bartender's mistake. However, if the venue automatically adds a gratuity for large parties or certain services, that might be a different case. But the author mentions they invited four friends to four drinks, which might not be considered a large party. \n\nThe key points are whether the bartender had the right to add the tip unilaterally and whether the author's response was appropriate. If the bartender didn't inform the customer and just applied the tip, that might be a breach of etiquette. However, if the venue's policy is to add a gratuity, then maybe the author's refusal is the issue. \n\nAlso, the bartender's response of refusing service might be inappropriate. However, the author's act of not tipping could be seen as defying a social norm, especially in places where tipping is standard. But if the bartender is trying to exploit a drunk customer, that's a different angle. \n\nIn some cases, establishments add a gratuity for large groups (like 6 or more people), but here it's four friends. So maybe the bartender added it on his own. If the bartender is supposed to let the customer choose, then adding it without asking is wrong. So the author's refusal might be justified. \n\nHowever, the author could have asked to remove the tip or negotiated the amount instead of leaving 0%. But given the situation, the author might feel wronged. \n\nSo the answer could go either way. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the bartender added the tip without consent, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the establishment's policy allows for automatic gratuities, then the author's refusal is the problem. \n\nBut the scenario doesn't mention an establishment policy. The bartender himself added it. So the author's response might be justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
