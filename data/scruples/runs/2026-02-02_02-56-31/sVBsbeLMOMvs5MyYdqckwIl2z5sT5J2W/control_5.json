      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks. When paying, the bartender automatically added 20% tip without telling them. The person got drunk but not too drunk to notice. They tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person says they wanted to tip appropriately but the bartender doing it without consent made them angry.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault here. Let's break it down. Tipping customs vary, but in many places, especially in the US, it's common to leave a tip for service. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. If the bartender added a 20% tip without consulting the customer, that's unusual. Normally, the customer decides the tip amount. However, some places might have a policy where a gratuity is automatically added for large groups or events, but the person should have been informed. The author might be right to be upset because the bartender didn't ask first. But when the author responded with 0%, that's not acceptable. Even if the bartender shouldn't have imposed the tip, the author's retaliation by not tipping at all is problematic. The bartender then refused service, which is his right if the customer is being difficult. \n\nSo, the key points: the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent might be wrong, but the author's response of zero tip and confrontation is also not appropriate. The author should have addressed the issue calmly, perhaps by asking to adjust the tip after the fact. Instead, they made a scene and refused to tip, which is not acceptable. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault. Bartenders deserve to be tipped, and the way the author handled it was poor. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
