      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed and tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them unless they tipped. They wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves but were upset the tip was added without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to recall norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in service industries like bars and restaurants. However, the bartender shouldn't just add a tip without the customer's knowledge. That's probably the key point here. The customer might feel their autonomy was violated by the bartender adding the tip without asking. However, the customer's response was to not tip at all, which could be seen as retaliatory.\n\nBut wait, the customer was drunk. Does that affect responsibility? Even if drunk, people are generally expected to follow social norms unless they're inebriated to the point of not being coherent. However, the customer did notice the bartender's action, so they were aware enough to respond. The bartender's action of adding a tip without permission might be against company policy. Some places require servers to disclose any automatic gratuities, especially for groups or events. If the bartender didn't inform them, that's a problem.\n\nThe customer's retaliation by tipping 0% could be seen as justified if they felt wronged by the unauthorized tip. However, the bartender's response to not serve them is also problematic because refusing service can be a last resort, but it depends on the situation. If the customer was being abusive or disruptive, the bartender has a right to ask them to leave. But here, the customer was upset about a policy they disagreed with.\n\nSo, is the customer in the wrong? If the bartender added a tip without permission, the customer isn't at fault for objecting. However, the customer could have asked for the tip to be removed or discussed it instead of retaliating by not tipping. But the bartender's initial action was the issue. The customer's response, while perhaps impulsive, was a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized action. Therefore, the bartender might be at fault for not disclosing the tip, and the customer's refusal to tip was a response to that. But is the customer entirely blameless? Maybe not. They could have handled it better by communicating their objection first instead of immediately cutting off the tip. However, the core issue is the bartender's lack of transparency, so the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) but with the caveat that communication could have been better.\n"
