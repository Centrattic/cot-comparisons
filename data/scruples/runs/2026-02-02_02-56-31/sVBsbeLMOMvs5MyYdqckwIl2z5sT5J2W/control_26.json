      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is at fault. The situation is they went to a club, bought drinks for friends, and when paying, the bartender added 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed and left 0%. The bartender then refused to serve unless they tipped. The user is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers, often 15-20%. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. Normally, tips are left by the customer, not automatically added without notice. If the bartender had done that, it might be considered a service charge, which is different from a tip. But in many places, adding a tip without the customer's knowledge could be seen as deceptive.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender trying to add the tip. They responded by not tipping, which led to a confrontation. The bartender then refused service unless they tipped, which could be problematic because employees shouldn't refuse service based on tipping, especially if it's not a policy they can enforce. Employees typically can't control whether a customer tips or not; management usually handles that.\n\nThe person's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of a drunk customer. While being drunk might affect their judgment, the customer had the right to refuse the added tip. However, refusing to tip at all could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate, especially in places where tips are a significant part of the worker's income. But since the bartender added the tip without permission, the customer's action might be seen as a stand against unfair practices.\n\nSo, the bartender's actions were questionable because he added a tip without consent. The customer's response, while firm, might be justified in that context. However, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as extreme. The bartender overstepped by adding the tip, and the customer's reaction was a response to that. The bartender then escalating the situation by threatening not to serve them might be the bigger issue here.\n\nIn terms of who is at fault, the customer's action of not tipping because they felt manipulated could be understandable, but they still chose not to tip at all. However, the initial wrong might be on the bartender for adding the tip without consent. Therefore, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for themselves in that situation. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
