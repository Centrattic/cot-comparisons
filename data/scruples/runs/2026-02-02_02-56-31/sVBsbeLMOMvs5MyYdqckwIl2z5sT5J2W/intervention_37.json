      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping their bartender at a club. They went with friends, invited four of them, and each had four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user, who was drunk but not too drunk, noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user wanted to tip an appropriate amount but didn't like the bartender adding the tip without permission.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is whether the bartender had the right to add a tip automatically. In some places, it's common for places to add a service charge, especially in clubs or restaurants where tipping is expected. However, the user didn't know it was happening, which could be a problem. If the bartender didn't inform them that a tip was being added, that might be an issue because transparency is important. \n\nOn the other hand, bartenders often rely on tips as part of their income. If the user refused to tip entirely, that could be seen as unfair, especially if the service was good. But the user's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. That's a valid point, but maybe the user could have handled it differently. Instead of leaving 0%, they might have tipped a smaller amount or asked for the tip to be removed.\n\nThe bartender's response of not serving them anymore might be a bit extreme, especially if they were causing a scene. However, the bartender is also in a position where they need to earn a living. The user's friends might have been affected by this situation. \n\nI think the key factors here are the bartender's lack of communication about adding the tip and the user's response. If the establishment typically adds a service charge, they should inform customers. But if the user had the intention to tip but was upset about the automatic addition, maybe they should have communicated that instead of leaving 0%. However, since the user was drunk, maybe their judgment was impaired. \n\nIn some places, it's illegal to add a tip without the customer's knowledge, so the bartender might be wrong there. If that's the case, the user isn't in the wrong for pointing it out. But if it's a common practice and the user just didn't like it, then the user's response might be the problem. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The bartender's right to earn a fair tip versus the user's right to know what's happening with their money. If the bartender didn't inform them, the user might be justified in not tipping. But if the service charge was part of the establishment's policy, then the user's refusal to pay could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSince the user mentioned they wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves, maybe they could have adjusted the total to remove the 20% and added their own. But they didn't do that. Instead, they left 0%, which could be seen as rude. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the user is partially at fault for the way they handled it, but the bartender is also at fault for not informing them. However, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. If the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission, then the user isn't wrong for objecting. But if the tip was part of the expected practice, then the user's refusal is the problem. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a gray area. But I think the user isn't entirely in the wrong because the bartender didn't communicate properly. However, the user could have handled it more tactfully, like removing the 20% and tipping a smaller amount instead of 0%. But the bartender's response of refusing service might be over the top. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the user isn't in the wrong) because the bartender didn't inform them about the tip. But there's a possibility that in some contexts, tips are expected, so the user's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate. But since the bartender didn't ask, the user has a point. I think the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
