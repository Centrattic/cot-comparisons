      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves but was upset that the bartender added the tip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard tipping practices. In many places, it's customary to tip service workers like bartenders around 15-20%, and some places even recommend adding a tip automatically. However, the key issue here is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without informing the customer. Usually, the customer should be informed if a tip is being added, especially if it's not the standard practice. The bartender might have violated the customer's autonomy by not checking.\n\nThe customer, while drunk, noticed the added tip and refused to pay it, arguing against taking advantage. The bartender then refused service. The customer's stance was that they wanted to tip on their own terms, which is their right. However, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as harsh, especially if the bartender relies on tips for their income. But the initial act of adding the tip without permission was problematic.\n\nSo, the customer might be in the right because the bartender didn't ask before adding the tip. However, the customer could have tipped an appropriate amount themselves instead of zero. The bartender's refusal to serve might be excessive, but the customer's response could also be seen as reasonable given the bartender's actions. The answer hinges on whether the bartender's actions were wrong and if the customer's refusal was justified. I think the author isn't in the wrong because the bartender acted unilaterally. So the answer is B.\n"
