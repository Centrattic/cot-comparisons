      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about not tipping a bartender. The user went to a club with friends, invited four people for four drinks. So maybe they ordered a total of four drinks for everyone? Not sure if that part is relevant.\n\nWhen paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the user. The user was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user says they were willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves but were upset about the bartender adding 20% without permission.\n\nFirst, the standard tipping practice in many places, especially in the US, is that tips are supposed to be left at the customer's discretion. Some places might automatically add a gratuity, especially if they have a policy, but the user might not have known about that. However, the bartender didn't inform the user before adding the tip, which could be problematic. The user might have expected to tip themselves, maybe a different amount.\n\nBut wait, in some places, especially bars or clubs, the service charge might be built into the bill. Maybe the user was in a place where a service charge is standard, but if the bartender added it without informing, that's an issue. Also, the user was drunk, which might affect their judgment, but the bartender shouldn't take advantage of that.\n\nThe user's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as retaliatory. The bartender's response was to refuse service if they didn't tip, which might be within his rights if the establishment has a policy, but maybe he shouldn't have done that. The user claims they were willing to tip an appropriate amount, but the initial action of the bartender upset them.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? The bartender added a tip without asking, which the user found unacceptable. The user then decided to not tip, which the bartender didn't like. But in many places, the customer can choose not to tip, though it's considered rude. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission is also questionable. If the establishment had a policy of adding tips, it should be communicated. If it's the bartender's own action, that's different.\n\nThe user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of their drunken state, which is a valid point. The bartender's argument is that he's entitled to a tip. However, the user's response was to tip 0%, which is within their right as a customer, even if it's not customary. But maybe the bartender's refusal to serve is also part of the problem.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, tipping is expected, but the way the tip was added without consent is a problem. So the user might not be in the wrong for not tipping, especially if they were willing to tip but the bartender didn't give them the choice. The bartender's actions of adding the tip without permission and then threatening not to serve them could be more in the wrong.\n\nSo the answer might be B (No), the user is not in the wrong because the bartender's actions were inappropriate, and the user had the right to refuse the automatic tip. However, some might argue that not tipping is rude regardless. But in this case, the user's reasoning is valid if the bartender didn't have the right to add the tip without informing.\n"
