      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user was drunk but not too much to notice. They then tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user wants to know if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall standard tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is common for service workers. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without asking the customer. Normally, the customer should decide the tip amount. If the bartender unilaterally added a tip, that might be an issue. The user's reaction was to not tip at all, which seems extreme but maybe a response to the bartender's action.\n\nIs it acceptable for a bartender to add a tip without informing the customer? Probably not. The tip is supposed to be a discretionary amount given by the customer. If the bartender added it without consent, that's against standard practice. However, some establishments have automatic gratuities for large groups, but in that case, the customer is usually informed. Since the user wasn't told, the bartender overstepped.\n\nThe user was drunk, but not incapacitated. They noticed the bartender's action and decided to retaliate by not tipping. The bartender then refused service. In some places, refusing service for non-tipping could be against the law, as the customer has a right to leave, but the bartender can't prevent them from exiting. However, the user's refusal to tip might be their right if the bartender acted improperly.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? If the bartender added a tip without permission, the user has a right to adjust it. However, tipping 0% is usually considered poor etiquette unless there's a valid reason. The user's reason here is that the bartender took advantage of a drunk customer, which might be a valid complaint if the bartender acted inappropriately. The user's response was to not tip, which could be justified in this specific context. However, the bartender's refusal to serve might have been the wrong move, not the customer's.\n\nSo, considering that the bartender acted first by adding a tip without consent, the user's reaction, while extreme, might be a response to that. Therefore, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
