      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The question is whether they are in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall customary tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is standard for good service. However, this can vary by location and context. The person was hosting friends, so maybe they expected to cover the tab, but the addition of the tip without their knowledge is a point of contention. \n\nThe bartender adding the tip without permission might be an issue. Tips are supposed to be voluntary, so if the bartender added it unilaterally, that's possibly against the customer's wishes. The person was upset about being forced to pay an extra 20% when they weren't asked if they wanted to tip. Especially when they were drunk, they might feel pressured or manipulated.\n\nHowever, the person decided to tip 0% in response, which is below the standard. But their reasoning was that the bartender was taking advantage of their intoxicated state. The bartender's response to refuse service if they don't tip is also problematic because in many places, businesses can't refuse service based on not tipping, as tipping is supposed to be voluntary. If the bartender is in a position to control the tip amount and then threatens to refuse service, that could be a breach of service policy.\n\nAnother angle: hosting friends, maybe the person had a budget in mind and the automatic tip went over it. If they didn't have enough money because of the tip, that's a reason to be upset. But the way they responded by tipping 0% might be seen as rude, but considering the bartender's actions, maybe they felt justified.\n\nLegally, in some states, automatic gratuities are allowed, especially for large groups, but for a regular service, adding tip without permission might not be standard. If the establishment has a policy of adding tips, they should inform the customer. If the bartender did it without informing, the customer has a right to be upset.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The person might not be in the wrong because the bartender added the tip without permission and then threatened to refuse service. The person's response, while perhaps not the most tactful, was a reaction to what they perceived as unfair treatment. The bartender's behavior was inappropriate. Therefore, the person isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
