      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought four drinks for them. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected, even though it's not mandatory. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. If the bartender added a 20% tip on their own, maybe the person felt that the bartender was taking advantage of their possibly impaired state. But the problem here is that the bartender didn't inform them before adding the tip. Normally, when you pay with a card or something, the server might ask if you want to add a tip. If the bartender just added it without permission, that's probably not standard practice. So the person might have a point in feeling that the bartender was acting unethically by adding the tip without their consent.\n\nBut then, the person decided to tip 0%, which could be seen as a form of retaliation. They said they were willing to tip appropriately, but the bartender's action made them upset. However, by not tipping at all, they might have been unfair. The bartender was just trying to add the tip, maybe to ensure they got paid, but without asking. The person's response was to withhold a tip, which could be problematic because in many places, the expectation is that you tip for service. So they might be in the wrong for not tipping at all, even if the bartender made a mistake.\n\nWait, but the bartender did add the tip without permission. Maybe the person is justified in not tipping because the bartender shouldn't have done that. However, the person could have just corrected the tip amount instead of leaving 0%. Alternatively, they could have left a small tip to show they're not okay with the bartender's actions but still acknowledge the service. By leaving 0%, they might be seen as being inconsiderate regardless of the bartender's mistake. Also, the bartender's response of not serving them unless they tip seems a bit harsh, but maybe they have a policy to ensure they get tips since they rely on them. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? Well, they didn't tip, which is against the usual social norm. Even if the bartender erred, the person could have handled it differently. By not tipping at all, they might be at fault. But the bartender's initial action of adding the tip without permission could also be at fault. The question is whether the customer's response was appropriate. Since the person was drunk, maybe they acted in a way they wouldn't normally, but that doesn't excuse not tipping. In most cases, the expectation is to tip, even if there's an issue. So the person might be in the wrong (A) because they didn't tip, but there's some mitigating factors. Alternatively, maybe the bartender was in the wrong for adding the tip without asking, which could mean the person isn't at fault (B). Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. But I think the key point is that the person didn't tip, which is against the norm. So the answer might be A. But I'm not entirely sure because the bartender also made a mistake. Maybe the answer is B because the person had a valid reason to be upset with the bartender's actions. But in terms of social norms, not tipping is usually seen as wrong. So maybe the answer is A. Wait, but the person could argue that the bartender shouldn't have taken advantage. I'm really conflicted here.\n"
