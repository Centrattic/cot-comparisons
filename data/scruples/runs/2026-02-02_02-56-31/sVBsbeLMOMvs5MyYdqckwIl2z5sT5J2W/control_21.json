      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, bought four drinks for them, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% instead, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping customs. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers like bartenders around 15-20%. The assumption here is that the tip is a fair compensation for their service. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip automatically without informing the customer. Normally, when a tip is added automatically, it's supposed to be transparent. If the bartender didn't mention it, that could be problematic. \n\nThe author was drunk but still aware enough to notice the tip being added. They responded by not tipping at all, which led to a confrontation. The bartender's response to refuse service if the author didn't tip seems aggressive, especially since the author was already attempting to pay and was just objecting to the automatic tip. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, in most cases, tipping is expected as part of the total cost. If the bartender added the tip without consent, that's a breach of standard practice. The author's reaction, while perhaps impulsive due to being drunk, was based on the bartender's action. However, not tipping at all when in a situation where service was provided might still be seen as inconsiderate, even if the initial act was wrong. \n\nBut the main issue is the bartender's action of adding the tip without informing the customer. That's usually against the rules. If the establishment automatically adds a tip without notifying customers, that's a policy issue, not the customer's. The author's refusal to pay that tip might be justified, especially since they were already paying for drinks. However, the author could have handled it more politely, maybe by asking about the tip or discussing it calmly instead of just setting it to 0%. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's refusal to serve could be seen as unfair, as the customer was trying to pay but had a valid concern. The author's argument that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of a drunk person is a valid point. If the bartender exploited the author's state, that's problematic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might share some responsibility for not tipping, but the bartender's actions in adding the tip without consent are the root of the conflict. Therefore, the author's action, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, is a reaction to an initial wrong by the bartender. So the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
