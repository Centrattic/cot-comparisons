      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went out with friends, bought them drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without permission. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they refused to tip, leading to the bartender refusing service.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand the cultural norms around tipping, especially in places like bars or clubs. In many places, tipping is expected as part of the service industry. Bartenders rely on tips to make a living because their base pay might be low. So, if the bartender added a tip without asking, maybe that's part of standard practice. But the author felt it was taking advantage, especially when they were drunk.\n\nWait, the author invited friends, so maybe they were paying for everyone. The bartender added the tip automatically, but the author didn't want to pay that extra. The key here is whether the bartender had the right to add a tip without the customer's knowledge. Some places do have an automatic gratuity for large groups or events, but if it's a regular bar, maybe not. The author might not be aware of that policy.\n\nThen the author refused to tip, which led to the bartender refusing service. The author's reasoning was that the bartender took advantage of a drunk person. But is it the author's fault for not tipping? Or is the bartender wrong for not explaining the tip policy beforehand?\n\nTipping is usually a way for customers to acknowledge good service. If the author thought the service wasn't worth a tip, maybe they had a reason. But generally, even if tips are added automatically, customers might still expect to tip voluntarily. If the bartender's policy is to add a tip, the author might have a right to be upset if it's done without consent. However, not tipping at all could be seen as rude or inconsiderate, especially if the author was drunk and acting on impulse.\n\nAnother angle: the bartender's response of refusing service is also questionable. Threatening to not serve someone over a tip dispute could be going too far. But maybe the bartender felt it was necessary to enforce their tipping policy.\n\nSo, who is at fault here? The author might be wrong for not tipping at all, but the bartender might also be wrong for adding the tip without informing the customer. The correct answer might depend on local customs and the specific establishment's policies. Since the author didn't know about the automatic tip, it's a bit of a grey area. However, in many cases, not tipping when you had the chance could be seen as the customer's fault. Alternatively, if the bartender should have explained the tip policy first, then maybe the bartender is wrong. But the author did have the opportunity to adjust the tip amount when paying, so refusing to tip entirely might be inconsiderate. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because even if the bartender made a mistake, the author could have tipped a lower amount instead of zero. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission, making the author not in the wrong for objecting. It's a tough call. Maybe B.\n"
