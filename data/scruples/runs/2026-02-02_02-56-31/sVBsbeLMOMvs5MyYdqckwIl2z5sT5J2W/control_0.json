      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, paid for four drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them, and the author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0%. The bartender then threatened not to serve him if he didn't tip. The author says he was willing to tip but didn't like the bartender adding the tip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers, and 15-20% is common. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. The author felt that was taking advantage because he was drunk. The bartender might have the right to add a service charge, but maybe not without informing the customer. \n\nSome restaurants do have automatic gratuities for groups or during certain times, which they should disclose. If the bartender did that without telling, maybe that's an issue. The author's reaction was to tip 0%, which is against the usual custom. But the author's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip. However, by not tipping, the author is also not following the norm, especially if the bartender expected it. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong for not tipping, even if the bartender added it without asking. Because even if the bartender made a mistake, the appropriate action might have been to correct the tip amount, not to refuse entirely. The threat from the bartender to not serve is a bit strong, but maybe the author's refusal is also problematic. \n\nAlternatively, if the bartender had the right to add the tip, then the author is wrong for not tipping. But if the bartender shouldn't have added it without permission, then the author's action is justified. It's a bit of a gray area. However, in most cases, customers can choose their tip amount, but service charges are sometimes added by the establishment, not the bartender individually. So maybe the bartender shouldn't have done that, but the author's response was also not appropriate. \n\nHmm. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the bartender added the tip without authorization, maybe the author is not at fault. But if the bartender was acting within his rights, then the author is at fault for not tipping. It's a bit tricky. I think the key point is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without the customer's knowledge, so the author's refusal is a reaction to that. But the author could have just adjusted the tip to their own preference instead of zero. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong, but the bartender also made a mistake. However, the question is about the author's actions specifically. \n\nGiven that, the author's action of not tipping could be seen as wrong because, regardless of the bartender's mistake, the author could have still chosen a different tip amount. But the author's reasoning was based on the bartender's error. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't tip, even though the situation was odd. Or B (not at fault) because the bartender shouldn't have done that. \n\nI think the answer is B. Because the bartender added the tip without permission, the author's refusal is understandable. However, in many places, tipping is expected, so the author's choice to not tip at all is problematic. But the initial action of the bartender was perhaps the main issue. So the author might not be entirely at fault. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. Maybe the answer is B.\n"
