      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them, and the person responded by leaving a 0% tip, arguing that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of a drunk customer. The bartender then refused to serve them further unless they tipped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in restaurants or bars, tipping is expected as part of service. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay with a credit card, sometimes the system might allow the server to add a tip automatically, but it's usually optional and the customer is informed. If the bartender did this without the customer's knowledge, that could be an issue. The customer felt that the bartender was taking advantage because they were drunk, which might be a valid concern if the customer was impaired.\n\nThe customer's response was to leave a 0% tip, which is against the norm. But the reason given is that the bartender didn't disclose the automatic tip. However, if the system requires the customer to manually add a tip, and the bartender just set it without asking, that could be a problem. On the other hand, if the bartender was using the point-of-sale system and the tip wasn't visible to the customer until they saw the total, then the customer might not have had a chance to adjust it.\n\nAnother angle is the bartender's response. Telling the customer they won't be served again if they don't tip could be seen as aggressive or unprofessional. Bartenders rely on tips, but refusing service because a customer didn't tip might be crossing a line. However, the customer did go against the norm by not tipping, which could be seen as disrespectful to the service staff.\n\nThe customer's argument is that the bartender was taking advantage of their state (being drunk). If the customer was visibly intoxicated and the bartender noticed, maybe there's some element of taking advantage there. But typically, servers are trained not to serve intoxicated customers, not to use their intoxication as an excuse to overcharge.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the bartender had the right to add a tip without the customer's knowledge. If that's the case, then the customer's refusal to tip might be justified. However, the usual expectation is that tips are left voluntarily. If the bartender didn't add the tip automatically through the system but just set it himself, then maybe it's not standard practice, and the customer had a right to object.\n\nIn summary, the bartender's action of adding a tip without informing the customer might have been inappropriate, especially if it's not the standard procedure. The customer's response, while against the norm, could be justified if they felt misled. However, the customer's decision to leave 0% is still against the usual tipping customs, which might make them at fault. But if the bartender's behavior was wrong, then the customer had a reason to push back. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the bartender's conduct was more in the wrong, especially if they didn't follow the establishment's standard practices. However, the customer's refusal to tip might still be seen as inconsiderate, even if the bartender was at fault. The answer might depend on cultural norms and specific restaurant policies.\n"
