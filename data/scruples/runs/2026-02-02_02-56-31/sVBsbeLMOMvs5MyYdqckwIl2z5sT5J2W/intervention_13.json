      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The user says they were willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves but were upset by the bartender's action.\n\nFirst, I need to recall tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending. The standard is usually around 15-20%. However, the user is upset because the bartender added the tip without their knowledge. Typically, when you pay with a card, the restaurant or bar may have the option for the server to add a tip, but the customer should be informed. If the bartender added it without consent, that's an issue. The user's response was to tip 0%, which is below the norm, hence the bartender's threat.\n\nNow, the user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip amount. But in reality, the user could have adjusted the tip or even left it at 0% if they were unhappy. However, the bartender's action of adding 20% without asking could be seen as taking initiative, which is sometimes done in places where tipping is part of the service. But the user felt it was taking advantage due to their intoxication.\n\nThe threat from the bartender to not serve them again if they don't tip is a problem. Employees shouldn't coerce customers into tipping. So the bartender's response was inappropriate. However, the user's initial decision to not tip after the bartender added the percentage could be seen as a conflict. But since the user was willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves, maybe they just wanted to control the amount.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the bartender acted inappropriately by not informing the user of the tip and then threatening them. The user's refusal to tip after the bartender's mistake might be justified, but not tipping at all in a place where it's expected could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the bartender's behavior was worse. Therefore, the user might not be in the wrong. But considering that the user had the choice to adjust the tip, maybe they should have communicated better. But given the bartender's actions, the user's response might be understandable. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
