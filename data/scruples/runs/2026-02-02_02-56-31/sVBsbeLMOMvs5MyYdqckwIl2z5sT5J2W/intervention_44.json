      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user went to a club with friends, invited four people for four drinks, which I assume means each person had one drink. Then, when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user, who was pretty drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff like bartenders. The expectation is that customers leave a tip as a gratuity for good service. However, the bartender added the 20% tip automatically without telling the user. That's a bit unusual because typically, the customer is expected to enter the tip amount themselves, or the system might suggest it, but not impose it without consent.\n\nThe user was drunk but not incapacitated. They noticed the bartender's action and responded by choosing 0%. This seems like a reaction based on the bartender's initiative to add the tip. The user's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk, which is a valid concern because intoxicated individuals might not be in the best state to make financial decisions. However, the user's response was to not tip at all, which could be seen as a way to push back against the bartender's unilaterally added tip.\n\nThe bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. That's a problem because a bartender can't legally deny service for not tipping, especially in the US. Tipping is a customer's choice, and servers or bartenders can't force it. So the bartender's threat might be inappropriate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user didn't tip because the bartender added the 20% without permission. The user's action was a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized addition. However, even if the bartender added the tip incorrectly, the customer is still expected to tip unless there's a specific reason not to. The user's decision to not tip might be seen as retaliatory rather than a response to poor service.\n\nBut here's the thing: the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. That's part of the issue. The user was in a vulnerable state (drunk) and the bartender took initiative, which the user took as taking advantage. However, the user's response was to not tip, which could be seen as a mistake because not tipping, regardless of the reason, is generally frowned upon unless the service was bad. So even if the bartender was in the wrong for adding the tip without permission, the user's non-tipping might still be considered wrong in the eyes of the establishment or society.\n\nBut wait, the user was invited to four drinks. That's four drinks total or four per person? The original statement says \"invited them (4 people) to 4 drinks.\" That might mean four drinks total for the group. So maybe each person had one drink. The total cost would be relatively low, and the tip would be a small amount. The user might have felt that the automatic 20% was excessive, especially for a small purchase. However, even for a small purchase, tipping is expected in the service industry.\n\nAnother angle: was the bartender's action of adding the tip against company policy? If the establishment automatically adds tips, that's their policy, and customers might not have a choice. However, if the bartender did it unilaterally without the system's support, that's different. If the system requires the customer to input the tip, and the bartender tried to set it without the user's knowledge, that's unethical or possibly a violation of the establishment's procedures.\n\nBut regardless, the user's choice to not tip in response to the bartender's action might be seen as a mistake because the appropriate response would be to inform the bartender or manager about the unauthorized addition. Refusing to tip could be seen as a poor choice, especially if the service was good. However, the user's reasoning was based on the bartender's attempt to take advantage, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn summary, the user's actions might be seen as a reaction to an impropriety by the bartender. However, the user's non-tipping could still be considered wrong because tipping is expected. The bartender's threat to refuse service was also inappropriate. So the fault might be shared, but the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since the user's response was to not tip, which is generally frowned upon unless there's a valid reason like poor service, and the reason here was the bartender's unauthorized action, it's a bit of a toss-up. But since the user was drunk, even a little, maybe their judgment was impaired, leading to an inappropriate response. Alternatively, the bartender's actions were the main issue.\n\nConsidering all factors, the user might not be entirely at fault because the bartender made the first mistake by adding the tip without permission. However, the user's decision to not tip, even in response, could still be seen as wrong because the proper course of action would be to address the tip amount after the fact or inform the bartender. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not tipping despite the bartender's error.\n"
