      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user went to a club with friends, invited four of them to have four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the user. The user, who was drunk but not too drunk, then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping customs. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is expected for service, including bartenders. If the bartender automatically added the tip, that's somewhat standard in some establishments, but the user might not have known that. However, the key issue here is that the bartender didn't inform the user before adding the tip. That could be a problem because the customer should have the choice to agree to the tip.\n\nThe user's reaction: tipping 0% in response to the bartender adding a tip without consent. The user might feel that the bartender was taking advantage by not asking first. But refusing to tip entirely could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the user was aware that tipping is customary. The user's drunkenness might affect judgment, but they still chose to act on it.\n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service is also questionable. In some places, a bartender can refuse service, but doing so might be seen as retaliatory. However, the user's refusal to tip could be seen as disrespectful, especially if the tip was part of the bartender's compensation.\n\nNow, considering AITA (Am I the Asshole), the user's actions might be seen as a bit entitled. Even if the bartender added the tip without permission, the appropriate response might have been to discuss it or not pay the tip but not leave 0%. The user's comment about not taking advantage of drunk people could be confrontational and unprofessional. The bartender's refusal to serve is also unprofessional, but perhaps the user's actions were more at fault here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the bartender should have communicated the automatic tip. But the user's response might be seen as overreacting. So, maybe the user is partially at fault for not tipping at all, while the bartender is also at fault for not explaining the tip. However, given the question is whether the user is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because not tipping in a service industry is generally frowned upon, especially after a confrontation. Alternatively, if the bartender didn't inform the customer, the user might have a point, but the zero tip is problematic.\n"
