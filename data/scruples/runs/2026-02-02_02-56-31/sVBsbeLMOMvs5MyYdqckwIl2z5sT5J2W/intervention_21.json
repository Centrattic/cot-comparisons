      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for not tipping the bartender who added a 20% tip automatically. The situation involves a group of friends, a club, and the user being drunk but not too drunk to notice.\n\nFirst, the bartender added a tip without informing the user. Normally, tips are supposed to be discretionary, so if the bartender added it without asking, that might be an issue. The user felt it was an opportunity to take advantage of someone who's drunk, which is understandable. But when the bartender threatened not to serve them, the user stood their ground and didn't tip. \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the user have the right to refuse the tip? In many places, tipping is a social norm, but it's not legally required. However, the bartender adding the tip without consent might be problematic. If the user felt coerced or that the bartender was overstepping, then the user's reaction might be justified. However, threatening to not serve is a serious action from the bartender. \n\nAlso, the user was drunk, which could affect their judgment. But the user claims they weren't too drunk to notice the issue. The user's main issue is that they wanted to tip appropriately on their own terms, not have someone else decide the amount. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender might have thought that adding a tip was standard practice, but not informing the user is a problem. The user's refusal to tip after being pressured could be seen as standing up for themselves against what they perceive as exploitation. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the user might not be entirely in the wrong because the bartender's actions were questionable. However, refusing to tip without trying to resolve the issue calmly could also be a factor. The bartender's threat to not serve is unprofessional, but the user's response of giving 0% might be seen as their right if they felt uncomfortable. \n\nIn the end, the user's decision to not tip after the bartender's actions might be justified, but it's a bit of a gray area. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, which is the main issue here. So the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
