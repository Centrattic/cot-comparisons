      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, a standard tip is 15-20%, so adding 20% is customary. But the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the user. That's a problem because the customer should be aware of the charges. The user was upset because the bartender took initiative without permission, especially while they were drunk. \n\nBut wait, is it the bartender's job to add the tip? Some places automatically add a service charge, but usually, they inform the customer before doing so. If the bartender did it without consent, that's an issue. The user might feel it's a manipulation tactic, especially if they were intoxicated. \n\nHowever, the user's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as retaliatory. Not tipping at all is a strong reaction. The bartender's refusal to serve might be a policy to enforce tipping, but that's also a point of contention. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. The user's response might be understandable given the situation, but not tipping is still a common way to express dissatisfaction. But the question is about whether the user is in the wrong. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because the bartender's actions were inappropriate. However, the user could have communicated better, maybe asked why the tip was added. But the bartender also shouldn't have assumed. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
