      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they invited four friends to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user was drunk but still noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user says they were willing to tip appropriately but didn't want the bartender to add it without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the service industry like bartending, tipping is expected and often considered part of the employee's pay. Automatically adding a tip might be a common practice in some establishments, but it's usually done with the customer's awareness, so the user might not have known about it here. The user's reaction could stem from feeling disrespected or manipulated, especially when drunk, but the bartender's refusal to serve might be a policy to cover their wages.\n\nHowever, the user's choice to tip 0% when the bartender was trying to add a 20% might be seen as a conflict. The user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of a drunk person, which could be valid, but not tipping at all is a strong counteraction. The bartender's response was to refuse service, which is within their rights if it's their policy, but the user is now questioning if they were wrong to do so.\n\nPossible angles: The user might be in the wrong because tipping is expected in the service industry, and even if the bartender added the tip without permission, the user could have asked to remove it or discussed it instead of refusing to tip entirely. On the other hand, the bartender's action of adding the tip without informing the customer could be considered unethical, and the user's response, though extreme, was a reaction to that. The drunk state might also factor in, but the user claims they weren't too drunk to notice and act, which complicates that argument.\n\nI think the key points are the expectation of tipping, the bartender's right to add a service charge (if it's allowed), and the user's right to refuse. If the bartender added the tip without informing, it's a problem, but the user's response of 0% tip could be seen as overreacting. However, if the user was just trying to assert their right to decide the tip amount, maybe they were justified. But in most cultures, not tipping at all is considered rude, especially in places where tips are a significant part of the employee's income. So the user might be in the wrong for not tipping at all, even if they had a reason. Alternatively, the bartender's approach was wrong, so the user isn't in the wrong for reacting.\n"
