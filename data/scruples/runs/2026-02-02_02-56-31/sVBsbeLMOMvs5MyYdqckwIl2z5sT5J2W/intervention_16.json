      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for not tipping the bartender. They were at a club with friends, ordered drinks, and the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they didn't tip anything, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, tipping norms vary, but in many places, especially in service industries like bars and restaurants, tipping is expected as part of the service. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the user. That's unusual because typically, even if there's a default tip setting, the customer should be aware or have the option to adjust it.\n\nThe user's response was to leave 0%, which might be seen as a stand against the bartender's actions. But from another angle, the user could have just adjusted the tip to a lower amount if they found the 20% too high. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent could be problematic. It's possible that the bartender was trying to ensure they got a tip, but it's not the customer's responsibility to let the staff decide the tip amount. The customer has the right to choose, or in some cases, even to tip less if they're dissatisfied, though that's a different scenario.\n\nThe user's argument is that the bartender was taking advantage of their drunkenness. If they were drunk, maybe their judgment was impaired, but they still made a conscious decision not to tip. However, the bartender's behavior of adding the tip without permission might be the root issue here. The user's response, while perhaps harsh, could be a reaction to feeling disrespected by the bartender's actions.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the bartender shouldn't pre-select a tip without the customer's knowledge. The user's refusal to tip might be a result of that, but whether that makes the user at fault depends on the context. Since the bartender acted unilaterally, the user's choice to not tip could be seen as a justified response, even if it's not the \"standard\" practice. However, in most service scenarios, customers are expected to tip regardless, so the user's decision not to might still be considered inconsiderate, especially if the service was good.\n\nBut the key here is the bartender's action. If the bartender had just asked for the tip, the user could have adjusted it. By adding it without permission, the bartender might have overstepped, leading the user to push back. So, while the user's choice not to tip is against the norm, the bartender's actions could have contributed to the conflict. The user might not be entirely at fault because the initial action from the bartender was inappropriate.\n"
