      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. Here's the situation: they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. The usual expectation is around 15-20% in restaurants or bars. However, the user didn't tip at all, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut here's the twist: the bartender added the 20% tip without informing them. The user noticed this and decided to not tip, thinking the bartender was taking advantage. The user's action was a response to the bartender's behavior. So the user might feel justified because they were not expecting the tip to be added automatically. However, in most cases, even if the tip is auto-added, customers still pay it unless there's a specific reason not to, like poor service.\n\nThe user was drunk, which might affect their judgment. However, they mention they weren't too drunk to notice the bartender's action. So they made a conscious decision to not tip. The bartender then refused service, which is within his rights in some places, but it's a strong reaction.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the user have the right to remove the automatically applied tip? Typically, if a tip is auto-added, you can request to remove it or adjust it, but refusing to pay any tip might be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the bartender's action. The user's response of 0% tipping could be seen as a form of protest, but it's still withholding customary payment.\n\nIn some places, the minimum tip required by law is lower than 20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be above that. However, the user's refusal could be considered inconsiderate. The bartender's response of refusing service is also questionable because he can't refuse to serve someone if they're not breaking the law or being disruptive. But in practice, some places allow servers to refuse service if a customer isn't tipping, though that's a separate issue.\n\nSo, putting this all together: The user's action was a response to the bartender adding a tip without consent, but customary tipping is expected. The user's decision to tip 0% is inconsiderate and against norms, even if they felt the bartender was acting inappropriately. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because they didn't follow standard tipping etiquette, regardless of the bartender's actions.\n"
