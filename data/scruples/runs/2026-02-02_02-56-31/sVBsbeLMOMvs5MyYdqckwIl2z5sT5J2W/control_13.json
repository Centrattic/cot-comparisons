      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, paid for four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not so much that they couldn't notice this. They responded by leaving 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars and restaurants, tipping is expected as part of the worker's income. If the bartender added a tip without asking, maybe the customer expected to control how much they tip. But usually, servers might add a tip automatically if they think it's appropriate, but the customer might have the right to adjust it. However, the customer here decided to leave nothing, which is against the norm. \n\nThe person was drunk but not incapacitated. So, they could make their own decisions. The bartender's action of adding a tip without permission might have been a miscalculation or a standard practice. If the customer felt coerced by the bartender's demand for a tip, that's another angle. But in some places, tipping is optional, but in others, especially in the US, it's customary. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the bartender have the right to add a tip without consent? Probably not. But the customer's response of leaving zero tips is extreme. However, the bartender threatening not to serve them if they didn't tip might be a problem. In some jurisdictions, service providers can't force customers to tip, and threatening service for not tipping could be illegal. \n\nSo, the customer might be in the right for not tipping if the bartender added it without permission, but the customer's response of zero tips is harsh. However, the bartender's threat to not serve them if they didn't tip is also problematic. \n\nIn this case, the customer might not be at fault because the bartender's actions were questionable. But the customer's decision to leave nothing could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's mistake. Alternatively, the customer should have adjusted the tip to a reasonable amount instead of zero. \n\nBut considering the bartender's threat, the customer might have been in their rights to refuse, especially if the bartender overstepped. However, the zero tip is still a strong reaction. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the bartender shouldn't have added a tip without permission, and the customer's response, while extreme, was a reaction to that. Also, the bartender's threat might be an issue. But there's a counter-argument that the customer should have tipped appropriately regardless. However, the main issue is the bartender adding the tip without consent, so the customer isn't at fault.\n"
