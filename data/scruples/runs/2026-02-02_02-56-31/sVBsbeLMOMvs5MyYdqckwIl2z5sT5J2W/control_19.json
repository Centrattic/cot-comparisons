      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation involves a group going to a club, inviting four friends for four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the person. The person, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them unless they tipped him. The person wasn't against tipping in general but was upset that the bartender added the tip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and often expected for services like bartending. However, the key issue here is the bartender adding a tip unilaterally without the customer's knowledge. Normally, the customer is supposed to decide the tip amount, sometimes with the option of a gratuity being added automatically, but usually with a note or a prompt. If the bartender did this without any communication, that's a problem. \n\nThe customer was drunk but not so drunk that they couldn't notice the bartender's action. They responded by not tipping, which led to the bartender refusing service. The person's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's intoxicated. However, the person was in a social setting where alcohol was consumed, so maybe their judgment was impaired. \n\nBut wait, the person wasn't opposed to tipping. They were willing to tip an appropriate amount but were upset because the bartender took initiative without permission. If the bartender had asked or informed them that a tip was being added, maybe the person would have gone along with it. The fact that the tip was added without any communication could be seen as the bartender's mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, in some contexts, automatic gratuity is standard, especially in places like clubs or restaurants where the service is more involved. The customer might not be aware that this is the norm, leading to a misunderstanding. The person's reaction might be seen as justified if they weren't informed about the automatic tip policy. \n\nHowever, the person's response of adding 0% tip and challenging the bartender's action could be seen as confrontational. The bartender responding by refusing service is also a point of contention. The person might not be in the wrong if the bartender didn't communicate the tip policy. Alternatively, if the bartender's job is to ensure tips are handled properly, they might be at fault for not explaining the policy. \n\nThe person was drunk, but not to the point of inebriation where they couldn't act. Their decision to not tip could be based on a misunderstanding or the bartender's failure to communicate. The key here is whether the bartender had the right to add a tip without the customer's knowledge. If the establishment has a policy of automatic gratuity, the bartender might be following it, but if not, then adding a tip unilaterally is incorrect. \n\nIn conclusion, the person might not be in the wrong if the bartender didn't inform them about the tip policy ahead of time. The bartender's action of adding the tip without consent could be the main issue here. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
