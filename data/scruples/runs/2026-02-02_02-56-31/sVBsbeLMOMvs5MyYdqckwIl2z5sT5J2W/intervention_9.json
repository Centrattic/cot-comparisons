      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for not tipping the bartender. They went to a club with friends, invited four others to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without permission. The user, who was drunk but not completely out of it, decided to tip 0% as a response, leading to the bartender threatening to not serve them. The user's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary, often around 15-20%, and it's expected as part of the service. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a problem because tipping is supposed to be a voluntary gesture from the customer to the server, not an automatic deduction. By adding the tip without asking, the bartender might be overstepping, possibly violating the customer's autonomy in the transaction.\n\nThe user's reaction\u2014tipping 0%\u2014is a direct response to the bartender's action. They felt the bartender was taking advantage of their state (being drunk), which is a valid concern. However, the user could have handled it differently. Instead of retaliating with zero tip, they might have asked to remove the added tip and then offered an appropriate amount themselves. That way, they could have maintained the customary tipping without the confrontation.\n\nBut the user's main point is that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip amount without consent. The bartender's response of refusing service is also questionable because refusing service based on tipping could be seen as against the law in some places, but that's a different issue. The core question is the user's responsibility. Since tipping is a social norm, the user might be expected to contribute, but the bartender's method of adding it without asking complicates that.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user isn't in the wrong for objecting to the bartender's unauthorized addition of a tip. However, the zero-tip response might be seen as a harsh reaction, even if justified by the bartender's actions. The user could have been more courteous or handled it in a way that still honored the tipping norm while correcting the bartender's mistake. So, while the user's intent to not be taken advantage of isn't wrong, the method of response might be seen as a bit extreme. However, given the bartender's initial misstep, the user's actions are understandable. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
