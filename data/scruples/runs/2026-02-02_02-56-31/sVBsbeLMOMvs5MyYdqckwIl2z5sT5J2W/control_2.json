      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author was drunk but noticed the tip and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them unless they tipped. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, 15-20% is standard for good service. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. But here, the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit odd because typically, the customer chooses the tip amount. The author felt that the bartender was taking advantage, which is why they refused to tip. \n\nBut wait, the author was drunk. Does that factor in? Well, if someone is drunk, they might make impulsive decisions, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent might be the root of the problem here. The author's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's actions. \n\nThen there's the bartender's response: threatening to not serve them. That might be unprofessional. Employees shouldn't coerce customers into tipping. But at the same time, the customer's decision to tip 0% could be seen as inconsiderate to the bartender who might rely on tips. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? On one hand, they didn't tip, which is against social norms. On the other hand, the bartender acted unilaterally, which might have justified the customer's reaction. However, the customer could have discussed the tip amount instead of setting it to 0. Also, the bartender's threat to not serve them might be a breach of professional conduct. \n\nSo, the author's responsibility here is a bit complex. They might be at fault for not tipping, but the bartender's actions also contributed. However, in most scenarios, customers are expected to tip unless there's a valid reason. Since the author didn't tip and reacted negatively, maybe they are in the wrong (A). But if the bartender acted improperly by adding the tip without consent, the author isn't entirely to blame (B). \n\nHmm. The key point is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without consent. If the bartender added a tip without the customer's knowledge, that's a breach of trust. The customer's response, while perhaps extreme, was a reaction to that. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The bartender shouldn't have done that, and the author had the right to refuse. So answer B.\n"
