      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought each of them four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person got angry, left a 0% tip, and the bartender refused to serve them further.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. The standard tip is usually around 15-20%. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without asking. That's a bit unusual because typically, the customer decides the tip amount. If the bartender just added it without consent, that could be seen as overstepping. The person might feel it's an imposition, especially since they were already paying for multiple friends' drinks, which could make the total higher than expected. \n\nBut then, the person responded by leaving 0%, which is against the norm. Even if they were upset about the automatic tip, not tipping at all is a strong reaction. The bartender's response was to refuse service, which might be his right if the customer is being difficult or confrontational. However, the customer was drunk, which is a factor. Some might argue that being drunk doesn't excuse poor behavior, but it could affect judgment.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission, which is a mistake. But the customer's reaction of leaving 0% is also problematic because it's a common expectation to tip, even if there's an issue. The customer could have tipped a smaller amount as a protest, but leaving nothing is more severe. The bartender's refusal to serve might be justified if the customer was being rude, but if the customer just left 0% without confrontation, it's a different scenario. It's a bit of a mix, but the customer's action of not tipping is against the usual practice, so they might share some responsibility.\n"
