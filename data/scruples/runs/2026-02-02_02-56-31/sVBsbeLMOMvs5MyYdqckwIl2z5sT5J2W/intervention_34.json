      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, had four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the usual tipping customs. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected, but it's supposed to be the customer's choice. The bartender adding the tip without asking might be a bit of a problem. Some places automatically add a tip, but usually, they inform the customer first. The user's reaction might stem from feeling that the bartender was taking advantage, especially since they were drunk. But was it appropriate to tip 0% in response?\n\nOn the other hand, refusing to tip because the bartender added it themselves could be seen as rude or uncooperative. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income, so not tipping could be considered unfair, even if the user felt the tip was forced. However, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent. That's a key point. If the establishment has a policy of automatic gratuities, they should communicate that. The user's right to choose their tip should be respected.\n\nBut the user's response of 0% might be harsh. Even if they were upset, not tipping at all might be excessive. Maybe a better approach would be to question the practice or adjust the tip amount rather than zero. Also, the bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is a bit strong. In some places, customers can't be forced to tip, though some places do add service charges for groups, which might be different from tips.\n\nSo, the user's error might be in not tipping at all after the bartender had already added a 20%. They could have adjusted the tip amount instead of cutting it to zero. But the bartender's initial action of adding the tip without consent is also a mistake. The user might not be entirely at fault, but their response could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the bartender shouldn't have forced the tip. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe the user isn't entirely wrong because the bartender acted inappropriately first, but their response wasn't perfect either. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, but perhaps the user could have handled it better. However, the user's choice to not tip could be seen as a justified reaction, so maybe B is the right answer.\n"
