      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. They went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, paid, and the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user was drunk but noticed it and tipped 0%, saying he didn't want the bartender taking advantage. The bartender then refused to serve him if he didn't tip. The user thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping etiquette. In many places, tipping is expected for service, especially in the US. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. However, the bartender added the tip without informing the user, which is a bit odd. Normally, the total including tip is shown, but the user might have thought the bartender was being dishonest by adding it without consent.\n\nThe user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by not tipping, which could be seen as a stand against unfair practices. But then the bartender refused service, which might be against the law in some places because refusing service based on not tipping could be illegal. However, in some jurisdictions, establishments can require tipping.\n\nSo, the user's action was a reaction to the bartender's action. The key points are: was the bartender allowed to add the tip without the user's consent? If the establishment automatically adds a gratuity for large groups or events, that's common. But if the bartender did it individually without informing, that's less standard. The user might feel it's deceptive. However, the user then didn't tip, which could be seen as retaliating. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? If the bartender added the tip without the user's knowledge, maybe the user had a right to question it. But not tipping in response could be seen as holding the bartender hostage. However, the bartender's response of refusing service might be the real issue here. In some places, refusing service because of a dispute is not allowed. So the user might not be in the wrong, but depending on the situation. The answer would depend on local laws and standard tipping practices. Since the user is asking AITA, the general public opinion might lean towards the user being wrong because not tipping is generally frowned upon, but the bartender's actions were also questionable. However, the user's retaliation could be seen as their fault. So maybe the answer is AITA, but I'm not sure. Need to check if the user is in the wrong. The user's action might be justified if the bartender was being dishonest. But in general, tipping is expected, so maybe the user is wrong. But if the bartender added the tip without permission, the user might have grounds. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is AITA (A), because the user didn't tip even though the bartender added a tip, which might have been standard, and the user's reaction was overstepping. Alternatively, if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip, the user is right. But without more context, it's hard. Based on typical scenarios, maybe the user is in the wrong because they didn't tip and escalated it. But the bartender's refusal to serve might also be wrong. So, the answer depends on the perspective. But in the AITA context, people often side with the person who didn't tip if they had a reason. Maybe answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
