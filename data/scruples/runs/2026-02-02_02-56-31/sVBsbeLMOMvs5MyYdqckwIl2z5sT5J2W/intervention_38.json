      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, ordered 4 drinks, paid, and the bartender added a 20% tip without saying. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they zero-tipped the bartender, telling him not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them again.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the standard tipping norms. Usually, in bars, especially for drinks, people tip around 15-20%. But the user's issue is that the bartender added 20% without informing them. That's a key point. Normally, the server should inform you if they add a tip automatically, especially in places where tipping is part of the service. If the bartender did that without consent, maybe that's the problem. The user felt it was an attempt to take advantage when they were drunk, so they zeroed out the tip. The bartender then refused service, which might be his right if they don't want to serve someone, but the user is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the user's actions were in response to the bartender's action. If the bartender didn't have the right to add the tip without permission, then the user isn't at fault. However, sometimes places do automatic gratuities for large groups or events. But the user was with four friends, which is a small group. Maybe the bartender thought it was a large party, but four isn't that big. The user's argument is that the tip was added without their knowledge, which could be seen as deceptive. So the user's response was to refuse the tip, leading to a conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the bartender might have overstepped by adding the tip without asking. The user had the right to adjust or remove the tip if they felt it was incorrect. However, the user's choice to zero out the tip might be seen as a valid response to the bartender's action. The bartender's refusal to serve could be his prerogative, but the user's actions might not be in the wrong if they believe the tip was added improperly. So the answer would be B, the user isn't at fault.\n"
