      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user went to a club with friends, invited 4 people to 4 drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but not too much so to notice. They decided to leave a 0% tip, arguing the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk customers. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, tipping practices can vary by region and establishment. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is customary for services like bartending. However, the key issue here is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without the customer's knowledge. In some places, automatic gratuities are allowed, but in others, they might require the customer's approval, especially if it's a surprise.\n\nThe user was drunk but not to the point of being unaware. They noticed the bartender trying to add the tip, which led to their decision to leave nothing. The bartender's response was to refuse service, which is a problem because in many jurisdictions, a bartender can't refuse service based on a lack of tipping. That's more about refusing service to someone who's already intoxicated, not over a tip amount.\n\nThe user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of a drunk customer. While the user was drunk, they were still conscious enough to make a decision. However, leaving a 0% tip is generally considered poor etiquette, but the context here is that the tip was added without consent. If the establishment has a policy of automatic gratuities, maybe that's standard, but if the bartender did it on his own, that could be an issue.\n\nSo, the user's action was in response to the bartender's unauthorized addition. However, refusing to tip at all might be seen as extreme. The bartender then overstepped by threatening not to serve. Legally, the bartender can't refuse service for not tipping. Ethically, the user might have a point if the tip wasn't agreed upon, but their response of 0% could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, the fault might be shared. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, and the user's response, while a reaction, was also impulsive. But since the question is if the user is in the wrong, considering standard tipping norms and the bartender's overreaction, the user might not be entirely at fault. However, leaving a 0% tip is still generally frowned upon, so there's some shared responsibility. But the main issue is the bartender's unauthorized tip, so the user isn't completely wrong. Answer B.\n"
