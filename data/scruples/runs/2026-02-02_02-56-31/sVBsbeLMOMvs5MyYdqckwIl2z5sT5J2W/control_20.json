      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but still noticed, so they tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person says they were willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves but were upset about the bartender adding the tip without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected and often considered part of the employee's income. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, customers are supposed to decide their own tips. If the bartender unilaterally added a 20%, that's against standard practice. The customer's reaction is based on that unauthorized action.\n\nThe person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by not tipping, which the bartender took as a refusal to serve. The bartender's response\u2014refusing service unless tipped\u2014might be a problem because it's the customer's right to choose their own tip. The bartender shouldn't have the authority to enforce a tip. However, the customer's zero tip in response could be seen as extreme, but the initial action of the bartender was wrong. The customer's right to control their own tipping is important here. So, the author isn't in the wrong because the bartender acted improperly by adding the tip without permission. The answer should be B.\n"
