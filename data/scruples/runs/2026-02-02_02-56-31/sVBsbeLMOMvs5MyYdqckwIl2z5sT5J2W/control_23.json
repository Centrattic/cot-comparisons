      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to leave a 0% tip, arguing the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's intoxicated. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person is now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many countries, especially the US, tipping is customary and expected for service staff like bartenders. The usual rate is around 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be in line with that. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, the customer decides the tip amount, so the bartender's action could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe customer was under the influence but not to the point of being unable to understand the situation. They felt the bartender was taking advantage, which is a common concern when someone else unilaterally adds a charge. The customer's response was to leave 0%, which is a direct refusal to pay the added tip. The bartender then threatened to not serve them, which could be a problem because refusing service based on payment terms might not be allowed unless the business has a strict policy.\n\nLegally, in many places, establishments can require a minimum tip, but if a customer is being threatened with refusal of service for not paying an unauthorized tip, that could be an issue. The bartender might be within his rights to expect a tip, but adding it without consent might not be. The customer's argument is about autonomy in tipping decisions, which is a valid point. However, refusing to pay the tip at all might conflict with standard expectations, but the method of the bartender adding it without checking could be problematic.\n\nSo, the question is whether the customer was wrong. If the bartender added the tip without permission, the customer has the right to correct that. However, completely negating the tip might be seen as harsh. But the bartender's approach was possibly wrong. The answer might depend on cultural norms and specific policies. Since the user is asking for an ethical judgment, not a legal one, the key is whether the customer overstepped. The bartender's action was inappropriate, so the customer's response, while strong, might be justified. Therefore, the answer would be B, the customer is not in the wrong.\n"
