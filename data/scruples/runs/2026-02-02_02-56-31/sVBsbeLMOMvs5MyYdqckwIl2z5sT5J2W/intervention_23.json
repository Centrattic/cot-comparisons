      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person got mad and tipped 0%, saying not to take advantage of someone who's drunk. The bartender then said he won't serve them if they don't tip. The question is, is the person at fault?\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service workers like bartenders. Usually, the customer is supposed to decide the tip amount based on the service. However, sometimes the establishment might automatically add a tip, which can be a point of contention.\n\nThe person felt the bartender was taking advantage by adding a tip without their knowledge. They were drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by not tipping at all, which led to the conflict. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the bartender have the right to add the tip without permission? In some places, automatic gratuities are common, especially in groups or for large parties. However, it's usually disclosed to the customer. If the bartender didn't inform them, that's a problem. The customer's right to choose their tip amount is important. \n\nThe person's reaction was to not tip, which might be seen as a protest against the automatic tip. But refusing to tip entirely could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the bartender relies on tips for their income. However, the bartender's response of refusing service might be overreacting, as customers shouldn't be forced to pay a tip they didn't agree to.\n\nLegally, in some states, tipping is optional unless stated otherwise. If the establishment doesn't disclose automatic gratuities, they might be violating the law. So the person might be justified in their reaction if the tip wasn't clearly communicated. \n\nEthically, it's about expectations. If the person didn't know the tip was being added and felt it was unfair, their response could be seen as a way to express that. However, not tipping at all might be harsh. A middle ground could be tipping a smaller amount instead of zero.\n\nIn conclusion, the bartender's mistake was adding the tip without informing the customer. The person's response might be justified as a protest, but the complete refusal to tip could be seen as harsh. However, since the bartender's action was the initial issue, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
