      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user went to a club with friends, invited four of them to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but still noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the standard in many places is to tip for service, especially in the US where bartenders often rely on tips as part of their income. But the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. Normally, when you pay, the tip is something you choose to add. If the bartender just put it in without asking, that's probably not standard practice. The user was upset because they felt the bartender was trying to take advantage of them being drunk. That's a valid concern because if someone is under the influence, they might not be in the best state to make decisions.\n\nHowever, the user's response was to tip 0%, which might be seen as a bit aggressive. They could have argued that the added 20% wasn't their choice, so they wanted to remove it. But by tipping 0%, they're not just removing the forced tip; they're refusing to tip altogether. That could be seen as unfair to the bartender, who might rely on tips for their livelihood. \n\nBut wait, the user was responding to the bartender's action. If the bartender added the tip without consent, the user might feel justified in not tipping. However, the bartender then refused service. Refusing to serve someone because they don't tip might not be legal, depending on the jurisdiction. But as a business policy, some places might have a no-service policy if you don't tip, but that's more common in restaurants than clubs.\n\nAlso, the user was drunk. While being drunk doesn't excuse poor behavior, it can affect decision-making. The user might have been defensive because they felt the bartender was exploiting their state.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They didn't tip, which is against the norm, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent is questionable. However, the user's response of 0% might have been an overreaction. The bartender's refusal to serve could be problematic too. \n\nBut according to standard etiquette, not tipping at all is usually seen as inconsiderate. Even if the tip was added without permission, the user could have removed the 20% and left a smaller tip. By leaving 0%, they might be in the wrong because they didn't compensate for the service. However, the bartender's initial action was also wrong. \n\nIn many places, adding a tip without the customer's knowledge is not allowed. So if the bartender did that, the customer isn't at fault for not tipping. But the user's action of not tipping might be a reaction to the bartender's mistake. \n\nThis is a bit of a gray area. If the bartender added the tip without permission, the user isn't obligated to leave a tip. But in most cases, customers are expected to tip. However, the bartender shouldn't have added it without consent. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong because the problem started with the bartender. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
