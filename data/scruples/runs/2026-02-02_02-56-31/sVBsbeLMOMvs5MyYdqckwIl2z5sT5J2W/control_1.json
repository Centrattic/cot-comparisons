      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks, so maybe they ordered a lot. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but still noticed this and decided to tip 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person claims they wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves but were upset about the automatic 20% they didn't agree to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The standard is usually around 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might seem normal. However, the key point here is that the tip was added without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, tips are supposed to be voluntary, and adding them automatically might be against the customer's intention. \n\nBut wait, some places do add a service charge automatically for large groups or certain events. If the club has a policy of adding a service charge, maybe the bartender was following that. However, the person claims they didn't know about this policy. The bartender didn't inform them, which could be an issue. The customer's reaction might be justified if they weren't aware of such a policy beforehand.\n\nThe customer was drunk enough to notice the tip being added, which suggests they were still somewhat aware of their surroundings. Their argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's intoxicated. That's a valid concern because intoxicated individuals might be more easily taken advantage of, and the customer is asserting their right to tip voluntarily.\n\nHowever, the bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. That's a problem because refusing service based on tipping could be discriminatory or against the establishment's policies. In some places, businesses can't force customers to tip, and adding a tip without consent might be against their own policies as well.\n\nSo, the customer's action of not tipping after the bartender added 20% without consent might be seen as a protest against that automatic addition. The customer wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves, so their choice to tip 0% could be a response to the bartender's action. But is the customer in the wrong for not tipping? If the standard practice is to tip, then not tipping is considered wrong. However, the situation involves the bartender acting in a way that might not have been transparent or agreed upon by the customer.\n\nAnother angle: the person invited friends to drinks. If they were the ones covering the cost, maybe they felt responsible for the entire payment, including the tip. The automatic tip might have felt like an extra charge they didn't agree to. But even if that's the case, the proper response would be to discuss it with the manager or clarify the policy, not to refuse to tip entirely. However, the bartender's response of refusing service was also inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent and then threatening not to serve is problematic. The customer's reaction, while perhaps not the most constructive (not tipping could be seen as a passive-aggressive response), might be understandable given the bartender's behavior. However, the expectation of tipping in the service industry is strong, so the customer might still be considered in the wrong for not tipping, even if the bartender acted improperly. But if the customer had a valid reason to object to the automatic tip, they might have the upper hand. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key is whether the customer had the right to refuse to tip in response to the bartender's actions. If the bartender violated the norm of transparency, the customer's action might be justified. But I'm still torn between A and B here. The question is whether the customer is at fault. If the bartender shouldn't have added the tip, the customer isn't wrong. If the customer is supposed to tip regardless, then they are wrong. But in reality, tipping should be voluntary. So if the bartender added it without consent, the customer is not wrong to refuse. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
