      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went out with friends, invited four friends to drinks, paid the bill, and noticed the bartender added a 20% tip automatically. The user then added 0%, and the bartender refused service if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service, and 20% is often considered generous. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the user. Normally, when you pay with a card, sometimes the system might default to a tip, but the user is responsible for it unless they correct it. But in this case, the bartender did it himself, which is a bit unusual. \n\nThe user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They felt the bartender was taking advantage, so they refused to tip. The bartender then threatened not to serve them. \n\nSo, the user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. The bartender's stance is that the tip is expected, and the user should pay it. \n\nFrom a typical etiquette perspective, tips are supposed to be left at the customer's discretion. If the service was good, 20% is standard. But the issue here is that the bartender added it himself. Maybe the user thought they were paying the exact amount they intended, but the bartender altered it. \n\nHowever, in most places, when you pay with a card, the system allows you to adjust the tip. If the bartender manually added it, perhaps the user should have corrected it before finalizing the payment. The user might have been in the wrong for not addressing it at the time instead of leaving 0% after the fact. \n\nBut another angle is that the bartender shouldn't have taken initiative to add the tip without the user's consent. That could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe user's response was to leave 0%, which is extreme. Even if they were upset, a better approach might have been to politely ask the bartender to remove the added tip and then leave a smaller amount if they felt the service wasn't worth 20%. \n\nAlso, the bartender's threat to not serve them because of a tip is problematic. Tips are supposed to be for service, and refusing service based on a tip amount might be against the law in some places. However, the user's refusal to tip after the bartender had already added it complicates things. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user might still be in the wrong for not handling the situation differently. They had the chance to correct the tip amount before paying but instead left 0%, which is a harsh response. The bartender's initial action was possibly inappropriate, but the user's reaction was also extreme. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but there's some nuance. The bartender should not have added the tip without permission, but the user's response was not appropriate either. However, in terms of right and wrong, the user's action of not tipping after the bartender's mistake is what led to the conflict, so they might be at fault.\n"
