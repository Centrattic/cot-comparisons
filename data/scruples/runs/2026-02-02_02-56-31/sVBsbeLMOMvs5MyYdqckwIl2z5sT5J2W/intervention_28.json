      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. The situation is about not tipping a bartender who added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but still noticed and decided to tip 0%. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to recall standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service, and it's customary to tip around 15-20%. Bartenders often rely on tips for a significant portion of their income. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, you can choose your tip amount, and some places might have a default, but if the bartender just put 20% without the customer's knowledge, that's a bit odd. \n\nThe user was drunk but not too drunk to notice this. They decided to tip 0% because they felt the bartender was being opportunistic. That might come across as rude because the customer is essentially punishing the bartender for doing something that's part of the job. But the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without the customer's consent. So there's a conflict here between the customer's right to choose their tip and the bartender's expectation of a tip based on their job.\n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is probably against the law in many places. Tipping is supposed to be voluntary, and employees can't force customers to tip. So from a legal standpoint, the bartender overstepped. However, socially, there's an expectation to tip, so the user might feel justified in their action given the bartender's initial mistake.\n\nBut wait, the user might have overreacted by leaving a 0% tip. Even if the bartender added the tip without permission, the appropriate response might be to correct the tip amount once noticed, not to retaliate by leaving nothing. But the user was drunk, which could affect their judgment. \n\nAnother angle: when you're in a club and buying drinks, especially for a group, the pressure to tip can be higher. The fact that the bartender added the tip without asking might be an error, but the user's decision to leave nothing might be seen as ungrateful or rude. However, the bartender's behavior of adding the tip without permission is also questionable. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the user's actions were a direct response to the bartender's unauthorized tip addition. But even if the bartender made a mistake, the user's response of not tipping and then the bartender refusing service is problematic. Legally, the bartender can't force the customer to tip, but socially, the user's actions might be seen as harsh. \n\nSo, the user might not be entirely at fault because the bartender did something wrong first. However, the user's reaction of leaving a 0% tip could be seen as inappropriate. It's a bit of a gray area. The main issue is whether the bartender should have added the tip without permission, and the user's response to that. \n\nIn conclusion, while the bartender made a mistake, the user's retaliation by leaving no tip might be seen as wrong. So maybe the user is in the wrong (A), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission, then the user isn't in the wrong (B). It really depends on cultural norms and expectations in the specific situation.\n"
