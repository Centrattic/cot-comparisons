      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the person. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by tipping 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he won't serve them if they don't tip. The person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, tipping norms vary, but in many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. The person argues the bartender added the tip without permission, which they found exploitative. But they had the chance to correct it. However, by not tipping at all, they might be violating the norm. The bartender's response of refusing service could be on shaky ground, as refusing service based on tipping might be against anti-discrimination laws. But the person's right to choose not to tip is there, but maybe the way they did it was inappropriate. They were drunk, which complicates their judgment. The key points are: the bartender added the tip without consent, the person objected by not tipping, and the bartender refused service. The person's actions could be seen as confrontational, but the bartender might have overstepped by adding the tip without asking. It's a bit of a gray area. The person might not be in the wrong if the bartender acted inappropriately, but their response (0% tip) could be seen as a tit-for-tat, which isn't ideal. So, maybe the person is not at fault because the bartender didn't ask first, but their reaction was also extreme. The answer might be B (No).\n"
