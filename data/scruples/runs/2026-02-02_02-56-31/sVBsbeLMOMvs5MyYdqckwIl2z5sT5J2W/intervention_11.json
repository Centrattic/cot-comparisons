I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, tipping norms vary, but in many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and expected. Bartenders often rely on tips as part of their income. So when the bartender added the 20%, maybe they thought it was the standard. But the user found it odd that the bartender did it without permission, especially since they were drunk. \n\nThe user's response was to not tip at all. That seems harsh because even if the bartender made a mistake, the user could have pointed it out and adjusted the tip. Instead, they went to 0%, which might be seen as retaliatory. Also, the bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is a bit of an ultimatum, which isn't great, but maybe the user's initial reaction was also problematic.\n\nThe key points are: Did the user have the right to refuse the tip? Maybe they felt disrespected by the bartender's action, but not tipping in response to that could be seen as inconsiderate. Bartenders don't earn minimum wage in many places, so tips are crucial. The user's decision to tip 0% might be unfair because even if the bartender made a mistake, the user should have the option to adjust the tip rather than zero it out. \n\nAlso, being drunk might cloud judgment, but the user still chose to tip 0% intentionally. So, perhaps the user is at fault for not tipping despite the bartender's mistake, while the bartender shouldn't have assumed the tip without confirmation. However, the main question is about the user's responsibility. The answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong (A) because they didn't tip, which is the norm, even if the bartender made a mistake. Alternatively, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission, which complicates it. But the user's final action of not tipping is the main issue here. So likely, the answer is A.\n"
