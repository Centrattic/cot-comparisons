      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender after he added a 20% tip without informing them. They were at a club with friends, got four drinks, and paid the bill. The bartender added a tip automatically, which the user noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling him not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected, and sometimes automatic tips are added to bills. The user might feel that the bartender shouldn't have assumed a tip without discussing it. However, the user's response of 0% tip is a strong reaction. \n\nThe user was drunk but not so much that they couldn't notice the tip being added. The bartender's action of adding a tip without consent could be seen as incorrect, as customers usually have the choice to adjust the tip. But the user's refusal to tip at all might be problematic because it's a common practice to leave some form of gratuity in such settings. \n\nThe bartender then refused service, which might be against company policy or local laws. Employees usually can't refuse service for not tipping, especially if the service was provided. The user's argument is about the bartender's right to add the tip unilaterally, which is a valid point, but their response was to not tip, leading to a confrontation. \n\nConsidering the situation, the user might not be entirely at fault because the bartender's action was questionable. However, the user could have handled it better by discussing the tip amount instead of refusing completely. The key factor is whether the bartender's action was within policy. If the establishment allows automatic tips, the user might be expected to adjust it. If not, the user's refusal is justified. But since the user didn't tip at all, it's a bit of a gray area. The bartender's response of refusing service is also an issue. Overall, the user might not be in the wrong, but there are elements where both sides have some responsibility.\n"
