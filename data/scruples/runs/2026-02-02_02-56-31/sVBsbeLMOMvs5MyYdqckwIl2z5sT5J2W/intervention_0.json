      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping a bartender who added a 20% tip without their knowledge. They were at a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender automatically added 20%. The user got upset, tipped 0%, and the bartender then refused to serve them. The user's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk, even if they were just a bit tipsy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service, and 15-20% is common. However, the situation here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Some places automatically add a tip for groups or events, but the key point is whether the customer was aware. If the bartender didn't inform the user that a tip was being added, that's a problem. The user felt it was a manipulation tactic, especially since they were somewhat drunk, which might impair their judgment.\n\nBut then, the user responded by not tipping at all. Even if the bartender added the tip without permission, isn't the appropriate response to tip the correct amount and perhaps mention the added tip? By not tipping, the user is essentially refusing to pay the service fee entirely. Bartenders rely heavily on tips, so refusing to tip could be seen as wrong, regardless of the bartender's mistake.\n\nHowever, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent is also questionable. If the establishment has a policy of adding a service charge, they should make it clear. The user might be right in objecting to that. But the user's response of zero tip seems excessive. A better approach would have been to ask the bartender why the tip was added and then tip appropriately. \n\nSo, the user's mistake might be reacting in a confrontational way instead of addressing the issue calmly. The bartender's response of not serving them again is also a problem because they can't just deny service without a valid reason, but that's on the bartender too. \n\nIn conclusion, while the bartender made a mistake by not informing the user, the user's response of not tipping at all is also wrong. They should have addressed the issue and still tipped the appropriate amount. Therefore, the user is at least partially in the wrong.\n"
