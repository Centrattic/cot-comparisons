      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user went to a club with friends, bought 4 drinks for them. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user was drunk but could still notice, so they left 0% tip, told the bartender not to take advantage, and the bartender then refused to serve them. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, first, in many places, servers and bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. Usually, a 15-20% tip is considered standard when you're served. But in this case, the bartender added the tip without consulting the customer. That's odd because the customer should have control over the tip amount. However, the user then retaliated by leaving 0%, which might be seen as a form of punishment. \n\nWait, the user was drunk but not so that they couldn't notice. So they had the capacity to choose. But why did they leave 0%? Because the bartender added 20% without asking. Maybe the user felt it was unfair or thought the bartender was trying to take advantage. However, the bartender's action of not serving them after the 0% tip could be a violation of their job responsibilities. Bartenders can't just refuse service solely based on a tip amount, right? There might be laws about that. \n\nBut the user's action of leaving 0% could be seen as a deliberate decision, not just a mistake. Even if the bartender added the tip, the user could have chosen to adjust it. But they didn't. So maybe the user is at fault for not tipping, even if they were upset. However, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. It's a bit of a two-way street. \n\nBut in many places, the tip is meant to be voluntary. If the bartender added it himself, maybe that was an error. The user's response was to leave 0%, which is within their right, but the bartender then refused to serve, which might not be allowed. However, the user's intention to tip appropriately but was annoyed by the automatic addition. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The user didn't tip, which the bartender might rely on. But the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. The user's decision to leave 0% could be seen as a protest, but the bartender's response was to deny service. \n\nI think the user is partially at fault because they chose to leave 0%, even if they were upset. But the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. However, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since the user deliberately left 0%, maybe they are in the wrong. But the bartender's action of not serving is also problematic. \n\nBut the user is asking if they are in the wrong for not tipping. If the bartender added the tip by mistake, the user could have corrected it, but instead left 0%. So maybe they are at fault. Alternatively, if the bartender was trying to force a tip, the user's refusal is justified. But the standard practice is that tips are voluntary. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn here. The user's action might be seen as a response to the bartender's mistake, but leaving 0% is still a valid choice. However, the bartender's refusal to serve is also an issue. But the user's question is about whether they are in the wrong. Since the user did leave 0%, which is their right, but the bartender's action might be more about their job. Maybe the user isn't in the wrong. Wait, but in some places, not tipping can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the server made a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, if the bartender added the tip on the bill, maybe the user was confused and tried to remove it, which is their right. But the user was drunk, so maybe they acted impulsively. However, they could have adjusted the tip instead of leaving 0%. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the user is not in the wrong because they had the right to decide their tip amount. The bartender shouldn't have added it without asking, and the user's response, while perhaps harsh, is within their right. The bartender's refusal to serve might be a bigger issue. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the user is not in the wrong).\n"
