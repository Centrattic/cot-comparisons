      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author got drunk but still noticed, and then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author thought they were acting appropriately but the bartender took offense.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the usual tipping customs. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service workers like bartenders. The standard is usually 15-20%, right? So if the bartender added a 20% tip, maybe that's just his way of making sure he gets a proper tip. But the problem here is that he did it without asking or informing the customer. So the author might have felt that the bartender was taking initiative without their consent.\n\nBut wait, the author responded by giving 0%, which could be seen as a refusal to tip at all. Even if the author was upset, is it acceptable to leave zero when the service was provided? On the other hand, the bartender adding the tip without asking could be seen as manipulative, especially if the customer is drunk. The author might have felt they had to take control of the situation to avoid being overcharged. But is that a valid reason to not tip?\n\nAnother angle: the bartender's response of not serving them if they don't tip. That's against the law in many places. In the US, for example, businesses can't require a tip or refuse service over a tip. So if the bartender said he won't serve them, that's illegal. The author might have been standing up for their rights there.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping. If the bartender added the tip without asking, maybe the author is justified in not adding another tip. However, the total tip would still be 20% if the bartender added it. Wait, the author said they were willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves. So maybe they thought the bartender should not have added the tip without their knowledge, and then they decided to not tip because of that. But if the bartender already added the 20%, then the author's zero tip would result in a 20% total. But maybe the author thought the bartender was trying to take advantage, so they wanted to correct it. \n\nBut from the bartender's perspective, adding the tip is part of the service, and the customer not paying anything could be seen as a slight. However, if the customer is drunk, then the bartender's action might not be appropriate. Also, if the customer is paying the bill for multiple people, maybe they feel more entitled to control how much is tipped. \n\nI think the key points here are: 1) the bartender added a tip without permission, which is unusual and possibly against company policy. 2) The author was drunk but still noticed, so maybe they felt the bartender was taking advantage. 3) The author's response was to not tip, but maybe they should have just adjusted the tip to a reasonable amount themselves instead of zero. \n\nIf the author had left a 15% tip instead of zero, maybe that would have been better. But by leaving zero, they might have wronged the bartender who relies on tips for income. However, if the bartender was adding the tip without consent, the author could argue that they were trying to prevent being forced to pay more. \n\nBut legally, the author can tip any amount they choose. The bartender can't force them. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not tipping, especially if they felt the bartender was being manipulative. The bartender's threat to not serve them is illegal, so the author's actions might be justified in that context. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have just left a normal tip and not let the bartender add his own. Maybe they overreacted. But since the bartender took the initiative, the author's response was to correct that. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong (B) because the bartender acted unprofessionally by adding the tip without permission, and the author had the right to tip as they saw fit. The bartender's response was also inappropriate. So the author is not at fault here.\n"
