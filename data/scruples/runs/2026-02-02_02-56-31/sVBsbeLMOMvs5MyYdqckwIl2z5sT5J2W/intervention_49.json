      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. Here's the situation: They went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user, who was drunk but not too drunk, noticed and didn't tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user wanted to tip appropriately themselves but was upset about the automatic 20%.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers like bartenders, often around 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. The user felt this was an attempt to take advantage, especially since they were drunk. \n\nBut wait, some places do automatically add a tip to the bill, which is legal. The user might not know that. However, the bartender adding it without explanation could be seen as deceptive. The user's response was to not tip at all, which might be seen as retaliatory. But the user argues they were going to tip themselves. \n\nThe bartender's threat to not serve them for not tipping could be problematic. In some places, employees can't force customers to tip, and threatening not to serve is against the law. So maybe the bartender overstepped. \n\nHowever, the user's decision to not tip after the automatic addition might be seen as a breach of social norms. Even if the bartender added it, the user could have just left the automatic tip and gone on their way. Refusing and causing a scene could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the bartender was following standard practices. \n\nBut the user's argument is that the bartender tried to exploit their state (being drunk) by not informing them. If the tip was automatically added without consent, that's an issue. The user might have a valid point if the bartender didn't explain the tip. However, in many cases, automatic gratuities are common in groups or at clubs, which the user might have been aware of. \n\nSo, the user's actions (not tipping and causing a confrontation) might be seen as inconsiderate, but the bartender's actions of adding a tip without informing could be the root issue. Depending on the location and local laws, the bartender might not have the right to enforce tipping. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user could have handled it more gracefully, perhaps by asking why the tip was added and then deciding to leave their own. By not tipping and creating a confrontation, they might be at fault. However, the bartender's threat to not serve them is also problematic. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a toss-up. But the user's decision to not tip after the automatic addition, especially without addressing it politely, might be seen as their fault. So, the answer might lean towards AITA. But if the bartender was wrong to add the tip without telling, then the user's reaction is justified. However, the user's response (0% tip and confrontation) is what's being judged here. So, maybe the user is in the wrong because they violated social norms by not tipping and causing a scene, regardless of the bartender's initial actions.\n"
