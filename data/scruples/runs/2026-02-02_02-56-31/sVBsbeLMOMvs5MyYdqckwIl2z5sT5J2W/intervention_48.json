He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. They invited four friends to four drinks, so maybe that's part of the context. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them, and the user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They decided to tip 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. Then the bartender said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out if the user is at fault here. Tipping norms vary, but in many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is standard. The user might not have tipped because they were upset the bartender added the tip without permission. But wait, sometimes places automatically add a tip, and the customer can adjust it. If the bartender did that without asking, that's probably not right. The user's reaction was to tip 0%, which is a strong response. But the bartender then refused to serve them, which could be a problem too, because refusing service for not tipping might be against company policy or legal.\n\nSo the user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip amount. The bartender's job is to serve, but maybe he shouldn't have added the tip without consent. The user was drunk but still conscious of the action, which might mean they were aware enough. The user's choice to not tip could be seen as a stand against the bartender's actions. However, not tipping at all might be considered rude in many cultures. The bartender's refusal to serve could be an overreaction, but the user's initial action of not tipping could also be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIs there a middle ground? If the user had tipped an appropriate amount instead of 0%, maybe the situation wouldn't have escalated. Or if the bartender had asked before adding the tip. But the user's reasoning is that the bartender exploited their possible drunkenness. That's a valid point because using someone's impaired state to take advantage is unethical. However, the user's response of 0% might have been too harsh. Perhaps a better approach would have been to tip a smaller amount and express concern about the automatic tip. \n\nIn terms of legalities, in some places, automatic gratuities are allowed, especially for large groups. But in a club setting, maybe it's different. The bartender's refusal to serve could be illegal if it's based on not tipping. But if the user didn't pay for the drinks plus tip, then the bartender might have refused service. Wait, the user paid for the drinks, but the bartender added a tip. So if the user then removed the tip, maybe the total was less than what the bartender was expecting. But the user's intent was to not tip, which might be a problem because the bartender expected a tip as part of the service. \n\nI think the key here is the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission. That's where the user's frustration came from. The user isn't at fault for not tipping in that case because the bartender shouldn't have assumed the tip amount. However, not tipping at all might be seen as rude, but the user's reasoning is about the bartender's behavior. So, the user might not be in the wrong if the bartender acted improperly. Alternatively, if the establishment's policy includes automatic tips, then the user might be in the wrong for not following that. But if the bartender didn't inform them of that policy, it's on the bartender. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's main issue is the bartender's unauthorized addition of the tip. The user's response to not tip might be a justified stand against that, even if it's not the typical tipping norm. The bartender's refusal to serve is also problematic. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong because the bartender acted first without consent.\n"
