      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip automatically without telling them. The person got drunk but was still aware enough to notice and then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. It's usually expected, and sometimes even part of the server's income. So if the customer expects to tip, but the server adds a tip without asking, is that okay?\n\nThe user mentions they were drunk but not too drunk to notice the automatic tip. They felt the bartender was taking advantage, which led them to not tip. But maybe the issue is that the bartender didn't ask before adding the tip. Some places do add a gratuity for large groups or events, but in a club setting, maybe the user didn't know that. If the bartender added a tip without permission, that might be an issue.\n\nThen, the user's response was to leave 0%, which the bartender refused service over. Bartenders rely on tips, so refusing to serve someone who doesn't tip could be a problem. However, the user felt they were being coerced into an automatic tip they didn't agree to. \n\nSo, is the user at fault for not tipping? Well, they were in a situation where the bartender might have expected a tip, but the user felt it was imposed without their consent. On the other hand, the user's choice not to tip after being asked (if the bartender added it without permission) could be seen as unreasonable if the bartender was just following standard practice. \n\nBut the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the user. In many places, servers can't add a tip without the customer's consent. For example, some states require servers to inform customers before adding a gratuity. If that's the case here, the bartender might have been in the wrong, and the user's refusal to tip could be justified. However, if it's standard for the establishment to add a tip for groups, then the user might be in the wrong for not tipping, but their reaction could stem from a misunderstanding.\n\nAlso, the user's response of 0% is extreme. Even if they felt the automatic tip was wrong, tipping a standard 15-20% themselves would have been better. But the user was drunk and upset, so maybe their judgment was impaired. However, being drunk doesn't excuse not tipping if the norm is to leave a tip.\n\nIn conclusion, the user might not be entirely in the wrong if the bartender added the tip without permission. However, refusing to tip entirely could still be problematic because tipping is expected. The bartender's refusal to serve might also be against the law in some places. So the answer could be B, the user isn't in the wrong, but there's nuance based on local customs and laws.\n"
