      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author, who was a bit drunk but not too much, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff like bartenders. The standard is usually around 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be following that norm. However, the key point here is that he added it without asking or informing the customer. If a bartender automatically applies a tip, that could be seen as appropriate, but if the customer objects, there's a conflict.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They felt the bartender was taking advantage by not disclosing the tip. The bartender's response to refuse service if they didn't tip is another factor. Legally, in some places, you can't force a tip, but service staff might have a right to expect it as part of their income. However, if the establishment doesn't have a policy of auto-tipping, the bartender shouldn't do it unilaterally.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? They didn't tip, which is against the norm, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent might be the real issue. The author's reaction is understandable if they felt disrespected. However, the author could have discussed it instead of just not tipping. The bartender refusing service could be a breach of the customer's right, but the author's approach might have escalated the situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, but the author's refusal to tip after that could be seen as a reaction to that mistake. But generally, not tipping at all is frowned upon. However, the context here is that the bartender acted without consent. So perhaps the author isn't entirely at fault. The answer might be B (not wrong) because the bartender's actions were inappropriate, and the author's response, while not ideal, was a reaction to that.\n"
