      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without saying anything. The author was drunk but still noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. However, it's usually up to the customer's discretion. But the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the author. That's a bit unusual because the customer should have control over their own tipping. If the bartender added a tip without asking, that could be seen as overstepping, especially if the customer wanted to leave a different amount or none at all. \n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. So their decision to leave 0% as a reaction might be a matter of personal ethics. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk, which is a valid point. However, the author's response was to leave no tip, which could be seen as a form of protest. But in terms of social norms, not tipping at all is usually considered rude, regardless of the reason. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's behavior of adding the tip without consent could be problematic. Many places have policies where gratuities are automatically added, but it's typically communicated to the customer. If the bartender did this without informing the author, it might be against store policy or an ethical issue. \n\nThe bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip, which is a strong reaction. Employees shouldn't coerce customers into tipping, as that could be a violation of workplace policies or even legal issues. \n\nSo, the author's action was a direct response to the bartender's perceived overreach. However, even if the bartender was wrong, the author's refusal to tip might still be seen as inconsiderate. But if the bartender's action was inappropriate, the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nIn terms of who's more in the wrong, the bartender might have made the first mistake by adding the tip without permission. The author's response, while perhaps extreme, was a reaction to that. However, not tipping completely is generally frowned upon, so the author might share some responsibility. \n\nI think the key here is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without asking. If that's not allowed, then the author isn't entirely at fault. But if tipping is expected and the customer's refusal is seen as rude regardless of the situation, then the author might be considered at fault. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area, but I lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the bartender's actions were inappropriate. The author had the right to decide not to tip, especially since the bartender overstepped. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
