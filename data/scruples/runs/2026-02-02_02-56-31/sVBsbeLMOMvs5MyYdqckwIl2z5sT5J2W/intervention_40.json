      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender after he added a 20% tip without telling them. The scenario is that they were at a club with friends, paid for four drinks, and the bartender automatically added the tip. The user got upset and left a 0% tip, leading the bartender to refuse service. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in service industries like bartending, tipping is customary and often expected. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, tips are supposed to be left at the customer's discretion. If the bartender just added 20% without asking, that's a bit odd. The user felt it was taking advantage of their being drunk, which might be a valid concern if they were impaired.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the user's response. They decided to leave 0%, which is a clear rejection of the bartender's action. The bartender then refused service because of the lack of tip. This is where it gets tricky. Bartenders shouldn't deny service over a tip, but they also rely heavily on tips for their income. However, if the tip was added without the customer's knowledge, the user might have been within their right to object and not leave a tip. \n\nBut here's the thing: in some places, it's against the law for a business to automatically add a tip to a customer's bill without their consent. So if that's the case, the bartender might have been in the wrong by adding the tip unilaterally. However, the user's decision to leave 0% after the tip was already added\u2014maybe that's seen as not being polite or not understanding the social expectation of tipping, even if they felt wronged. \n\nAlso, the user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So their judgment might be impaired, but they were aware enough to act. The bartender's refusal to serve because they didn't tip could be seen as holding up service, which is a problem. But the user's action might be justified if they felt the tip was forced. However, in many contexts, not tipping at all is considered rude regardless of the circumstances. \n\nSo weighing both sides: the bartender added the tip without permission, which is possibly against the rules, but the user's response was to not tip at all, which could be seen as a form of retaliation and not in line with standard tipping etiquette. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not tipping despite the bartender's mistake, but the bartender also acted inappropriately by adding the tip without consent. However, since the question is about the user's actions, the answer might hinge on whether the user's decision was a reasonable response to the bartender's actions. If the bartender shouldn't have added the tip, then the user isn't wrong for not leaving a tip, but if the tip was allowed, then the user is in the wrong for not tipping. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the user being in the wrong because they didn't leave any tip at all, even if they felt wronged. But maybe the bartender shouldn't have added the tip. Hmm.\n"
