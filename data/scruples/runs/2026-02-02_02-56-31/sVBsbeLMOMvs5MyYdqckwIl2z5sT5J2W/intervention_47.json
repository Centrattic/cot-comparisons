      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by giving a 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped, and the user is asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the usual expectations around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The standard is usually around 15-20%, and sometimes the establishment adds a tip automatically. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the user. That's a bit unusual because typically, the customer should be aware of the tip amount. If the bill was presented with an automatic 20% tip, the user might not have had a chance to review it, especially since they were drunk.\n\nThe user's response was to give 0%, which is essentially refusing the automatically added tip. The bartender then threatened to not serve them if they didn't tip. So, the user is in a situation where they feel the bartender took advantage of their possible state of being drunk by adding a tip without consent, and the bartender is standing by their demand for a tip.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the bartender is doing their job and expecting a tip, which is part of their income. If the user didn't want to tip, that's their choice, but the bartender might feel justified in requiring it since it's part of their pay. On the other hand, the user might feel that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without their knowledge, especially when they were under the influence. The user's action of giving 0% could be seen as a protest against the automatic tip, which might be a valid point if the user wasn't aware of the tip being added.\n\nAnother angle is the social norm of tipping. If the user is in a place where tipping is expected, not tipping could be seen as rude or inconsiderate. However, the user's argument is that the bartender took advantage of their state, which complicates things. If the bartender added the tip without asking and the user was not sober enough to notice or object, maybe the user has a point about being taken advantage of.\n\nBut then again, the bartender might have a policy of adding a tip, and the user's refusal to accept it could be seen as disrespectful. The fact that the user was drunk might not absolve them from the responsibility to tip, but it could explain their reaction. The bartender's response of refusing to serve them is a bit aggressive, but they might have felt it was necessary to enforce their policy.\n\nSo, where does the fault lie? The user might not be in the wrong if the bartender didn't inform them about the tip. However, in many places, automatic gratuities are standard for groups or large parties, so the user might have known or should have checked the bill. Their reaction of giving 0% could be seen as a conflict, but the bartender's refusal to serve might also be excessive.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a tricky situation. If the user didn't know the tip was added and was drunk, they might not be at fault. However, if the policy was in place and the user didn't check the bill, then they could be at fault for not tipping. The answer might depend on local customs and the specific establishment's policies. But since the user pointed out the bartender's action and refused to tip, they might not be entirely wrong.\n"
