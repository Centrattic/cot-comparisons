      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought four drinks for their friends, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author was drunk but noticed this and tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of them. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The usual tip is around 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be within normal range. But the issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit of a problem because the customer should be aware of any additional charges. However, in some establishments, especially in clubs or places with high service charges, they might automatically include a tip, but they should still disclose it. \n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So they observed the bartender trying to put a tip in without telling them. Their response was to tip 0% and confront the bartender for taking advantage. The bartender then threatened not to serve them unless they tipped. The author's stance is that the bartender shouldn't assume the customer will tip a certain amount, especially without communication. \n\nFrom the customer's perspective, being forced to tip or facing refusal of service could be seen as coercive. However, in some places, there's an expectation that you tip for good service. But the key point is the bartender adding a tip without the customer's knowledge. That's possibly against the policy, as tips are supposed to be voluntary. If the establishment has an automatic service charge, it's usually disclosed upfront, not added at the register without notice.\n\nThe author's argument is that the bartender was taking advantage of a possibly impaired customer. Even if they were drunk, the bartender shouldn't assume they can't make their own decisions. The customer's response, while confrontational, was because of the bartender's unauthorized addition. The bartender's response of refusing service might be in line with their policy, but if the tip was supposed to be automatic, maybe the customer should have been informed beforehand.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The bartender might have violated the customer's right to know what charges are being applied. The customer's decision to tip 0% could be their right, especially if they felt the service was inadequate. However, in practice, tipping is often expected, and refusing might lead to issues. But the main issue here is the bartender adding a tip without permission. So the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender's action was possibly inappropriate. But there's a counterpoint that the author could have just allowed the 20% tip and not argued, considering the social norm. However, the bartender's refusal to serve after the customer's decision might also be problematic if it's not a standard policy.\n\nI think the key here is whether the bartender had the right to add a tip without informing the customer. If the establishment's policy is to add a service charge, it should be disclosed in advance. If not, the bartender shouldn't have done that. The customer's reaction, while maybe confrontational, is a response to that unauthorized action. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender initiated the problematic action.\n"
