      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends, so maybe they were covering drinks for everyone. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but still noticed, and then decided to tip 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is part of the service industry's compensation. Bartenders often rely on tips, so not tipping could be seen as rude or unethical. However, the bartender here added the tip without asking, which might be an issue. The person felt it was an overreach, especially when they were drunk. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't assume they wanted to tip, especially when the customer is vulnerable (drunk). They wanted to decide the tip amount themselves. But the bartender's response\u2014refusing service\u2014seems extreme. However, from the bartender's perspective, expecting a tip is part of the job, and the customer's refusal to comply led to a confrontation.\n\nIs the customer wrong for not tipping? Well, the bartender added the tip without permission, which is a breach of etiquette. Normally, the server would ask or let the customer decide. If the customer feels forced, that's a problem. Also, the customer was willing to tip an appropriate amount but was upset about the bartender's unilateral action. \n\nBut then again, refusing to pay any tip could be seen as cutting off the bartender's income. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent is ethically questionable. The customer's decision to not follow through might be a form of protest against that. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the bartender's action was wrong, and the customer responded in self-defense by not tipping, which might not be entirely their fault. The bartender's refusal to serve is also a problem because they can't just deny service over a tipping dispute. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the bartender initiated the issue by adding the tip without asking. The customer's response was a reaction to that, so they aren't entirely wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
