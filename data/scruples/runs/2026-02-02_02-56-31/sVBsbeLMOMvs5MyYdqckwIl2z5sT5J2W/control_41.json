      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four people to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunks. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers, and 15-20% is typical. However, the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit odd because usually, the customer is in control of the tip amount. The author felt this was a problem, maybe because they thought they were being forced into a tip or that the bartender was overstepping. \n\nThe author's response was to tip 0%, which might be seen as a protest against the bartender's action. But is that justified? The bartender's action of adding a tip without asking could be a policy of the establishment or maybe a mistake. However, in some states, mandatory tips are allowed if it's part of the business's practice and clearly communicated. If the club adds a gratuity for large parties or groups, that's a common practice, but the customer might not be aware. The author invited four friends, making five people total, which could be considered a group, so maybe the club has a policy of adding a tip for groups. But the user didn't mention being informed of this policy beforehand.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. So they made a conscious decision to not tip in response. The bartender then refused service, which is a problem because in some places, refusing service for not tipping is illegal or against the establishment's policies. Employees should report issues to management rather than refuse service themselves.\n\nThe author's defense is that they believe tipping should be voluntary and were upset that the bartender assumed they would tip. They might feel that the bartender was taking advantage of their possible impaired judgment. On the other hand, the bartender might have thought he was following the club's usual practice, which the author wasn't aware of. \n\nNow, considering the ethics: Tipping is often expected in service industries, and not tipping can be seen as inconsiderate. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without permission could be problematic. If the tip was non-negotiable and part of the club's policy, then the author might be at fault for not complying. But if the bartender acted on his own without informing the customer, the author's response could be justified as a protest against that action. \n\nAlso, the author was part of a group, and sometimes group tips are higher or added automatically. However, if the establishment didn't communicate this, the author might not be aware. The key here is whether the addition of the tip was a policy the club had in place. If it's a standard practice, then the author's refusal to tip could be seen as not following the norm. But if the bartender did it unilaterally without any prior notice, the author's reaction is understandable. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without the customer's consent. Therefore, the author's response, while perhaps extreme, might be a reaction to an initial wrongdoing by the bartender. However, by not tipping at all, the author is refusing to pay for a service they received. That could be seen as unfair because the bartender's service is part of the transaction. Even if the tip was improperly added, the customer still received the service and should pay for it, even if they have to correct the tip amount.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't pay for the service they received, even if there was an issue with the tip. The proper response would have been to inform the bartender about the mistake and either correct it or ask for a refund if necessary. Refusing to pay entirely, even in protest, is not usually acceptable. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is at fault). However, there's a counterargument that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip unilaterally. But since the author didn't pay for the service, they are still responsible for the cost.\n"
