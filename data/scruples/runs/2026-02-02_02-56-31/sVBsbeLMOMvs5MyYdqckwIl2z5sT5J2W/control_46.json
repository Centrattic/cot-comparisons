      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing the person, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice. The person then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by saying he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars, tipping is customary and often expected. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. When someone pays with a credit card, sometimes the system might have a default tip, but the customer can adjust it. However, the key here is whether the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's unusual because typically, the customer has control over the tip amount. If the bartender added 20% without permission, that's problematic. \n\nThe person was drunk but not incapacitated. They noticed the tip being added, which suggests they were aware enough to make a decision. The bartender's action might have been a mistake, maybe a system default, but the person's response was to not tip at all. Now, is that justified? Well, if the bartender added the tip without consent, the person might feel it's a form of coercion. But generally, tipping is a customer's choice, even if there's a default. \n\nHowever, the person's reaction led to a conflict. The bartender refused service if they didn't tip. But refusing service is within a business's rights if there are policies against unruly behavior. The person might have been confrontational, which could justify the bartender's actions. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? They didn't tip, which is against the norm, but the bartender's unauthorized tip might have been the catalyst. The person's intent was to not be taken advantage of, which is understandable. However, the outcome of refusing to tip at all could be seen as a harsh response. Normally, if you're upset about a forced tip, you might tip the correct amount but express your concern, or perhaps not tip as much but not zero. \n\nBut the person's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. They were drunk but not too drunk to act. The bartender's mistake might have been adding the tip without permission, but the person's choice to tip 0% could be seen as their right. However, in many places, even if a default tip is added, the customer can adjust it. If the person adjusted it to 0%, is that their right? Or is there an expectation to tip regardless?\n\nThis is tricky. If the person is in a place where tipping is customary, not tipping could be seen as rude or inconsiderate, even if the bartender made a mistake. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission is also a problem. The person's response might be justified as a reaction to that unauthorized addition. But the person's final action of not tipping at all could be seen as the wrong move because it's an industry norm to tip, and the bartender's action might have been an error. \n\nSo, considering all this, the person might be at fault for not tipping, but the bartender was also incorrect in adding the tip without consent. However, the person's decision to retaliate by not tipping at all might be the main issue here. Therefore, the answer would be A (person is in the wrong) because even if the bartender made a mistake, not tipping is against standard practices. Alternatively, if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip, then maybe the person isn't at fault. \n\nBut the key point is that the person had the choice to adjust the tip. If the bartender added it by mistake, the person could have corrected it to a reasonable amount. Choosing to tip 0% is a harsh reaction, so the person is in the wrong. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
