I invited them (4 people) to 4 drinks. When I was paying, the bartender himself put a 20% tip without telling me. Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user went to a club with friends, bought them drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They decided to tip 0%, saying not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, tipping norms in the US often include a 15-20% tip for service, especially in places like bars and restaurants where staff rely on tips for a significant portion of their income. However, the bartender here added the tip without the customer's knowledge, which is a bit tricky. Normally, tips are added at the customer's discretion. If the bartender didn't check with the customer first, that might be part of the issue. The user felt misled and decided to tip zero, which the bartender saw as a refusal to pay. The bartender then refused service, which could be a problem because refusing to serve someone based on their decision not to tip might be against anti-discrimination laws, depending on the location. \n\nBut the user's response of 0% might be seen as withholding a customary tip. However, the key here is the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission. If the user was under the impression that the tip was mandatory or that the bartender was taking advantage, their reaction is understandable. The bartender's response of not serving them could be more problematic than the user's initial decision. \n\nSo, considering the bartender's actions and the user's reaction, it's a bit of a gray area. The user might not be entirely in the wrong if the bartender didn't follow proper procedures. However, the user also didn't tip at all, which could be seen as not adhering to social norms. But the main issue is the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent. Therefore, the user might not be in the wrong here.\n"
