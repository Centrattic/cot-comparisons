      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not tipping a bartender. The author went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added 20% tip without asking. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0% to prevent the bartender from taking advantage of drunk people. The bartender then threatened not to serve them anymore. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in restaurants and bars, usually around 15-20%. However, the situation here is a bit different because the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. The customer might feel that this is an automatic addition, which they were not consulted about. \n\nThe author's response was to tip 0%, which is against the usual practice. But their reasoning was that the bartender was taking advantage of someone who was drunk. However, being drunk doesn't necessarily mean the customer can't make their own choices. The bartender might have added the tip as a standard practice, but not informing the customer could be an issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's response of refusing service if the customer doesn't tip seems extreme. Tipping is usually a customer's choice, and while businesses can encourage tipping, they can't force it. The threat to not serve them anymore might be a violation of consumer rights. \n\nSo, the author's action of not tipping after the bartender's unauthorized addition could be seen as a response to a problem they had with the service. However, the appropriateness of a 0% tip in a context where tipping is expected is debatable. The author might not be in the wrong because the bartender's actions were questionable. But then again, the author could have communicated their preference before reacting.\n\nIn some cases, if someone is drunk, their judgment might be impaired, but the author claims they weren't too drunk to notice the tip being added. The ethical dilemma here is between the customer's right to choose their tip and the bartender's right to expect a tip. If the bartender added the tip without asking, maybe it's an overreach. The author's response, while perhaps not the best approach, might not be entirely their fault because of the bartender's actions. \n\nAlternatively, the expectation of tipping is part of the bar service, so not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the bartender's method of adding the tip without consent might have been the root of the problem. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's decision might be a justified reaction to the bartender's actions, so they might not be in the wrong. However, the threat from the bartender is also problematic. The answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, because the bartender's actions were inappropriate, and the author's response, while unorthodox, was a direct response to that issue.\n"
