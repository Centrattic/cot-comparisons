      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for not tipping their bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks, paid the bill, and the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but noticed and then decided to tip 0%, leading to an argument where the bartender refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in service industries like bars and restaurants. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the situation here is that the bartender added a tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, when you pay with a card, there's an option to add a tip, and sometimes if you don't specify, the system might not add it automatically. But in this case, the bartender himself manually added 20%. That might be unusual, as typically the customer is supposed to decide on the tip amount.\n\nThe author felt that the bartender was taking advantage because they were drunk. That could be a valid concern if the bartender used the customer's state to impose a tip. However, the author's response was to not tip at all, which might be seen as a direct retaliation. The question is whether the author had a right to refuse the tip or if they should have accepted the bartender's action as part of the service.\n\nAnother angle is the bartender's response. He said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. That's a bit of a problem because refusing service can be a last resort, but it's important to consider the context. The bartender might have felt that his usual expectation of a tip was being ignored, especially if he added it to the bill, which isn't standard practice. Normally, the tip is left by the customer, and the bartender can't enforce it. So if the bartender pre-added a tip without the customer's consent, that could be the issue here.\n\nThe author's argument is that the bartender shouldn't have assumed a tip without informing them, especially when they were under the influence. But even if someone is drunk, they still have the right to decide how much to tip. The bartender's action might have been overstepping, and the author's response, while perhaps extreme in zero tipping, could be a reaction to that overreach.\n\nHowever, the author could have handled it differently. Instead of removing the tip entirely, maybe they should have discussed with the bartender to remove his added tip and then leave their own. But given the situation, the author's main point is about the bartender's autonomy in adding a tip. The key here is whether the bartender's action was appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the bartender likely made a mistake by adding the tip without the customer's knowledge, which could be seen as deceptive. The author's refusal to tip was a reaction to that, but it's a bit of a conflict of expectations. Since the author was a good customer (invited friends, paid the bill), the bartender's refusal to serve might be excessive. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there are nuances. However, the main issue is the bartender's pre-added tip without consent, so the answer might be B (No).\n"
