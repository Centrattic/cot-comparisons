      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a common practice, often expected, and part of service workers' income. Bartenders rely on tips, so not tipping could be seen as unethical. However, the situation here is that the bartender added the tip without asking. The author felt it was an overreach, especially when they were drunk, and decided to zero out the tip. \n\nSo, the key points are: the bartender added a tip unilaterally, the author objected, and the bartender refused service. The author's action was a reaction to the bartender's initiative. The question is whether the author was wrong to not tip.\n\nI need to weigh both sides. On one hand, the bartender might have thought it was standard to add a tip when someone is paying for a group, especially if the customer seems willing to spend (buying drinks for friends). On the other hand, the author felt it was manipulative, especially when the customer was under the influence and couldn't make the decision freely. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the bartender added a tip without permission, that's not the customer's fault. The customer has the right to decide how much to tip. However, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as rude, but the context here is that the bartender was trying to force a tip. The author's response was a stand against that, which might be justified. \n\nBut the author did end up not tipping at all, which could be seen as a problem because service workers depend on tips. However, the situation is complicated by the bartender's actions. The author might not be entirely at fault because they were reacting to the bartender's initiative. \n\nAnother angle: the bartender's refusal to serve if they don't tip. That's a bit strong. Normally, a business can refuse service for various reasons, but adding a tip without consent and then threatening not to serve might be crossing a line. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author didn't act in bad faith. They noticed the bartender's unauthorized tip addition and reacted against it. The bartender's actions were perhaps the root of the problem. The author's decision to not tip in response might be a valid reaction, even if they could have chosen a different amount. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
