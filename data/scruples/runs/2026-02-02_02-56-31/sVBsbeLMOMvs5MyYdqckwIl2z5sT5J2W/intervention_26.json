      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. They went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, then refused to tip, leading the bartender to refuse service.\n\nFirst, I need to recall typical tipping customs. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service, and it's common for servers to rely on tips as part of their income. However, the user's main issue was that the bartender added the tip without asking. Usually, when a customer pays by card, the terminal might have a default tip, but the customer should be able to adjust it. If the bartender manually added 20% without the user's knowledge, that's a problem because it's the customer's choice.\n\nThe user's reaction: not tipping in response. But even if they were upset, refusing to tip altogether could be seen as harsh. The bartender's response was to refuse service, which is understandable if the customer is being difficult or not cooperating. However, in a club setting, sometimes they take cash and tips might be handled differently, but that's not specified here.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They didn't tip because they felt the bartender added the tip without permission. The bartender's action might have been wrong, but the user's response of zero tip could be excessive. Alternatively, maybe the user should have adjusted the tip to a lower amount instead of zero. But if the bartender was trying to force the tip, the user's refusal could be justified. However, in most cases, even if you're upset, not tipping is considered rude, especially in service industries where tips are crucial.\n\nAlso, the user was drunk, which might affect their judgment. But being drunk doesn't excuse poor behavior. The bartender's threat to not serve them if they don't tip is a bit aggressive, but it's their right to refuse service. The user might have overreacted by not tipping at all. The appropriate action would have been to correct the tip amount they were comfortable with instead of leaving zero. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for not tipping, even if the bartender made a mistake.\n"
