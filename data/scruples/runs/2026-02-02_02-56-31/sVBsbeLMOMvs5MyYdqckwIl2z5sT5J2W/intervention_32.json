      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is at fault here. So the user went to a club with friends, invited 4 people for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he won't serve them anymore.\n\nHmm. First, I know that in many places, especially in the service industry like bars, tipping is expected. The usual practice is for customers to leave a tip, sometimes 15-20%, and sometimes the bill might include a suggested tip. But if the bartender added 20% without the customer's knowledge, that's a bit odd. Typically, the total bill would show the tip amount, but maybe the system was set up to auto-add it. However, the user felt that the bartender was trying to take advantage because they were drunk, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's job relies heavily on tips. Not tipping at all might be seen as rude or unfair to the employee, especially if the service was good. The user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip himself, but maybe that's part of the establishment's policy. If the user didn't want to tip, they could have adjusted it, but they were upset because the bartender did it without permission.\n\nThe user's response of zeroing out the tip and calling the bartender out for exploiting them might have been harsh, but their reasoning is understandable. However, the bartender then refused to serve them, which is a bit of a problem. Employees shouldn't be able to deny service just because of a customer's tipping choice, right? But maybe that's within their control. However, the user's initial action might have been the catalyst.\n\nSo, considering the situation: the user was upset about an unexpected tip addition and responded by not tipping. The bartender didn't serve them after. The user's actions might have been inconsiderate, but the bartender's response could be excessive. But in terms of who is at fault, the user might have overreacted by not tipping at all, even if they were unhappy. Tipping is a social norm, and even if the bartender added a tip, the user could have adjusted it to a lower amount instead of refusing entirely. Therefore, the user might be at fault for not handling the situation more politely, especially since the bartender's action could have been a standard procedure the user wasn't aware of. So, Answer A (Yes, they are in the wrong) seems more likely.\n"
