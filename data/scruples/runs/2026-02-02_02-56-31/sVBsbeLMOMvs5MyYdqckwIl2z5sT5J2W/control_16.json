      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the person went to a club with friends. They invited four friends for drinks, so that's five people total. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but still noticed this. They then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender responded by saying he won't serve them anymore if they don't tip. The person argues they wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves but were upset about the bartender automatically adding the tip without asking.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the bartender added a tip without consent, the person refused to pay that extra and ended up not tipping at all, and the bartender threatened not to serve them. The question is whether the person is at fault.\n\nIn terms of tipping norms, in many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected and often added automatically in certain establishments. However, it's generally understood that the customer should have the choice to tip, and if an automatic tip is applied, it should be disclosed. So if the bartender added 20% without telling the customer, that might be a problem. The customer's reaction is based on that lack of transparency.\n\nThe person's argument is that they wanted to decide their own tip amount. If the bartender added the tip without permission, the customer might feel it's an overreach, especially when drunk. The bartender then refused service, which could be against the law in some places, as refusing service based on non-payment of tips is illegal. But that's a separate issue.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the person is upset about being forced to pay a tip without being told. Even if tipping is customary, the bartender's action of adding it without consent might justify the customer's response. However, choosing to tip 0% after that could be seen as going too far, especially if the bartender is relying on tips as part of their income.\n\nBut the key here is the bartender's action. If the establishment adds a tip automatically, they should inform the customer. Since the bartender didn't, the customer might have a valid point. The person's decision to refuse the automatic tip could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's dishonesty. However, by not tipping at all, they might still be at fault because the bartender's job depends on tips, and refusing to tip entirely might be harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's refusal to serve them could be legally problematic, but that's more about the bartender's actions than the customer's. The question is about the customer's responsibility. If the bartender is in the wrong for adding a tip without consent, then the customer's reaction isn't entirely their fault. However, if the customer should have just paid the tip and then addressed the issue with management, maybe they are at fault for not handling it properly.\n\nI think the main issue is the bartender's lack of transparency. The customer had the right to know before the tip was added. If they found out after the fact and decided not to pay, maybe that's their prerogative. But if the establishment's policy is to add a tip, the customer should be informed beforehand. So, the answer might lean towards the customer not being in the wrong because the bartender didn't disclose the tip. However, some might argue that the customer should still tip appropriately regardless. But given the bartender's actions, the customer's response is understandable. So the answer is B, the person is not in the wrong.\n"
