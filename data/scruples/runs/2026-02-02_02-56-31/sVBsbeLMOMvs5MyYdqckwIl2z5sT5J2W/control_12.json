      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about not tipping a bartender after they added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They decided to leave a 0% tip, which led the bartender to refuse service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers. The standard is often 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be within that range. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, restaurants or bars add gratuities for large groups or during certain times, but it's usually disclosed upfront. If the bartender added it without telling, that's probably the issue. The customer felt it was an overreach, especially since they were already paying for 4 drinks for friends, which might have been a significant amount.\n\nThe person in question then left 0% as a reaction, which is a strong response. They might have felt disrespected that the bartender assumed they would tip without asking. But the problem is that the bartender added the tip without consent, which is unprofessional. However, the customer's retaliation by not tipping at all could be seen as a bit harsh. Even if the bartender did something wrong, the appropriate response might be to question it at the register or not tip that percentage, but leaving 0% when they were willing to tip an appropriate amount might be their choice, but could also affect the bartender's income.\n\nThe bartender then refused to serve them, which is a more serious action. In some places, servers can't refuse service for not tipping, but it depends on local laws. However, the person's action of not tipping after the bartender added it without consent could be a valid response if they believed they were being taken advantage of, especially when drunk. But the main question is whether the person is in the wrong. They didn't tip, but the bartender's action might have been the initial wrong. \n\nSo, the person might not be in the wrong because the bartender added the tip unilaterally. However, the response of leaving 0% could be seen as a tit-for-tat, which might not be the best approach, but maybe not their fault if they felt disrespected. Alternatively, the bartender's refusal to serve is more problematic. \n\nI think the key here is that the bartender's action was the initial problem. The customer had the right to decide their own tipping, and if the bartender added it without asking, that's a breach of norms. The customer's reaction, while perhaps a bit extreme, was a response to that. So the person might not be in the wrong.\n"
