      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author, who was a bit drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then threatened not to serve them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. The standard tip is usually 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be within the normal range. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That could be a problem because the customer didn't have the chance to agree to or adjust the tip. \n\nThe author's response was to tip 0%, which is not typical. The author's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. But the author was the one who chose to be in that situation, knowing they were drinking. However, being drunk doesn't eliminate the responsibility of the customer to act appropriately. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's action of adding a tip without asking might be against restaurant policies. Some places require servers to get the customer's approval before adding a tip. If that's the case here, the bartender might have been wrong to do so. But the author's response of refusing to tip entirely and being confrontational could have been a mistake. \n\nThe author claims they wanted to tip an appropriate amount but were annoyed by the bartender's action. But by setting the tip to 0%, they effectively didn't tip at all, which is below the expected norm, regardless of the bartender's mistake. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The bartender might have made a mistake by adding the tip without permission, but the author's response was also inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author didn't tip at all, which goes against the customary practice, even if there was an issue with the bartender's action. The author could have adjusted the tip to the standard amount instead of zero. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of not tipping at all despite the circumstances. But there's a nuance here. If the bartender's action was against policy, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the author's response was to not tip, which is the bigger issue. So, probably answer A (author is in the wrong).\n"
