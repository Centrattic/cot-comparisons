      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is at fault. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but still noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall typical tipping customs. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending. The standard is usually 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be following that norm. However, the user didn't know the tip was added automatically. If the bartender didn't inform them, maybe that's an issue. \n\nBut the user, despite being drunk, noticed and decided not to tip, which upset the bartender. The bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is a problem because employees can't legally deny service for not tipping. However, the bartender might have done that as a way to enforce their expectation. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk, but if the user was aware they needed to tip and the bartender just added it without their knowledge, maybe the user is overreacting. Alternatively, if the bartender didn't mention the tip at all, that's poor service. \n\nAnother angle: if the user intended to tip but was upset about the automatic addition, maybe they could have discussed it calmly. However, the bartender's method of adding the tip without communication might have been the root of the conflict. \n\nI think the user is in the wrong because they chose to tip 0% after being informed of the standard practice. Even if the bartender didn't explain, the user could have asked for the total without the tip. Refusing to tip in response to the automatic addition is a breach of the expected tipping norm. The bartender's refusal to serve is also wrong, but the user's action of not tipping is the initial issue here. So, the answer is A.\n"
