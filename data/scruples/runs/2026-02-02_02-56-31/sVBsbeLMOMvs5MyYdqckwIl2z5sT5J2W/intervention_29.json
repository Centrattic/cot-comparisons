      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four of them to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending. The standard is usually 15-20%, and sometimes the establishment adds a tip automatically. But the key here is that the bartender added the 20% without the user's knowledge. Automatic tips are common, but maybe the user felt it was a trick because they were drunk. The user's response was to tip 0%, which the bartender didn't like, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, considering the user's state of being drunk, but not too drunk to not notice the tip being added. They might feel the bartender was taking advantage by not informing them. However, the user's decision to tip 0% is a direct refusal, which the bartender saw as a problem. The user claims they wanted to tip appropriately but were upset about the automatic addition. \n\nPossible angles: Is it the user's responsibility to check the tip amount? Should they have known about the automatic tip policy? Is the bartender allowed to refuse service if a tip isn't given, even if it's automated? Also, the user invited friends to drinks, so maybe the total bill was higher, but the issue is the tip. \n\nIn many cases, tips are part of the service cost, and sometimes businesses add them to ensure fair compensation for staff. If the bartender is expected to receive tips, and the user refuses to pay, that could be seen as not fulfilling their part. However, if the bartender didn't inform the user about the automatic tip, that's a problem. The user's anger might be justified if the policy wasn't clear. But refusing to tip entirely after the fact could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate. \n\nAdditionally, the bartender threatening not to serve them because of the tip is a point against him, but the user's action of zero tipping is also an issue. The user might not be in the wrong if the bartender didn't communicate the tip policy. However, expecting a tip is part of the service, and refusing to pay it could be seen as their fault. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on local norms and the establishment's policies. If the tip was automatically added without prior notice, the user's reaction is understandable. But choosing to not tip at all, despite the automatic addition, might be seen as their mistake because they could have adjusted the tip amount if they wanted. Therefore, the answer could be A (they are at fault) or B (not at fault). \n\nBut in many places, tips are considered a part of the service, and even if automatically added, the customer can adjust it. So if the user didn't like the automatic 20%, they could have chosen a different amount. By setting it to 0%, they ignored the standard practice. Hence, the user is at fault. But if the bartender didn't inform them about the policy, maybe the bartender is at fault. However, the user's response of zero tipping is still inconsiderate. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
