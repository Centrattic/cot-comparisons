      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they went to a club with friends and invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The question is whether the person is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The standard is usually 15-20%, and sometimes the total bill includes a suggested tip. However, if the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that's a bit odd. Normally, the customer should have control over the tip amount, even if the system defaults to a percentage. \n\nSo the person was invited by them for 4 drinks each for four friends. That's 16 drinks total. The cost would depend on the venue, but assuming each drink is, say, $10, that's $160. A 20% tip would be $32. If the bartender added that without the customer's consent, the customer might feel it's an overcharge, especially if they were already paying for multiple drinks for friends.\n\nThe person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They decided to tip 0% as a protest. The bartender then refused service. Now, in the US, refusing service because a customer didn't tip is generally not allowed. However, the customer's decision to tip 0% might be seen as a breach of social norms. But the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking could be the root issue.\n\nIs the customer in the wrong? Well, tipping is a social expectation, but the bartender's actions of adding the tip without consulting the customer might be the problem. However, the customer's response of 0% tip could be seen as a deliberate choice, even if they were intoxicated. But if the bartender was taking advantage by adding a tip without permission, the customer's reaction might be justified as a stand against that practice.\n\nBut in some places, tips are supposed to be optional. If the bartender added the tip automatically, maybe the customer is within their rights to remove it. However, the customer might not have realized the tip was being added, but in this case, the customer noticed and decided not to tip. The bartender's refusal to serve them could be illegal if it's based on not tipping, as businesses can't legally refuse service for not tipping, but sometimes they do for other reasons.\n\nSo, considering all that, the question is whether the customer did something wrong. The bartender's action was questionable, but the customer's response might be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But some might argue that the customer should have tipped regardless. It's a bit of a gray area, but the bartender's unauthorized addition of the tip is a key point here.\n"
