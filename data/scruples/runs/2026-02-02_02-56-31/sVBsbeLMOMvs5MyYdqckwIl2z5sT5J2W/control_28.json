      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author got drunk but noticed this, then tipped 0% because they thought the bartender was taking advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author says they wanted to tip appropriately but the automatic tip upset them.\n\nFirst, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected and usually around 15-20%. Bartenders rely on tips for a significant part of their income. However, some places might automatically add a tip, especially if the customer is a regular or if the establishment has such a policy. The key point here is that the bartender added 20% without informing the customer. That might be an issue because typically, customers should have control over their own tipping decisions.\n\nThe author was drunk but still noticed the bartender adding the tip. They decided to not tip in response because they felt the bartender was taking advantage. This reaction might come from a place of feeling that the bartender shouldn't assume they'll tip, especially when the customer is intoxicated. However, refusing to tip at all could be seen as extreme, as the bartender is providing a service. The author's justification is that they wanted to tip appropriately but the automatic addition was problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's response was to refuse service, which might be within their rights if the establishment's policy requires tipping. But it's also possible that the policy allows for customers to adjust the tip. The conflict here is between the customer's right to decide their tip and the bartender's expectation of compensation.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author's action was to tip 0% after the bartender added 20% without permission. If the bartender didn't inform the customer, that's a problem. But the author's response of zero tipping could be seen as a form of retaliation rather than a reasonable adjustment. Maybe the appropriate response would have been to remove the 20% tip or adjust it, not leave nothing. However, the author's argument is that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip. In some contexts, like if the customer is visibly drunk, the bartender might be cautious about adding a tip without consent. \n\nBut bartenders often rely on tips, so the customer's refusal could be seen as withholding fair compensation. However, the initial act of adding the tip without informing the customer is also questionable. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's action might be justified if the bartender overstepped by adding the tip without permission, but the zero tip could still be seen as harsh. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the bartender's action was problematic, but the author's response could be seen as extreme. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the bartender has a policy of adding tips, the customer might be expected to accept it. If not, then the author is justified. Since the scenario says the bartender \"himself put a 20% tip without telling me,\" it's implied that the bartender didn't follow standard procedure of letting the customer decide. So the author's reaction is understandable, but leaving zero might be too much. However, in some places, tipping is a customer's choice, so the author isn't wrong for not tipping in that context. \n\nI think the key is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without consent. If not, the author's action isn't wrong. If the bartender was following a policy, maybe the author should have adjusted it rather than zero. But given the information, the author's stance is more about the bartender's action than their own refusal. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
