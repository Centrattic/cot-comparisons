      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user went to a club with friends, invited 4 friends to 4 drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by not tipping and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are tipping etiquette, the bartender's actions, and the user's response. In many service industries, especially in places like the US, tipping is customary and often expected. However, it's also true that the customer should have the choice to tip. The bartender added the tip without informing the customer, which the user found unethical. The user then decided to not tip, possibly as a reaction to the bartender's action.\n\nThe user was drunk but not to the point of being unable to make the decision. The argument here is whether the bartender's actions were appropriate. Adding a tip without asking could be seen as a way to ensure a tip, which some might consider a good practice, but others might see as taking advantage. The user felt that the bartender was taking advantage of their intoxication, hence the refusal to tip.\n\nNow, considering standard practices: in some places, bars and restaurants automatically add a service charge. If that's the case, and the user wasn't informed, maybe the bartender violated the establishment's policy. However, if it's common for the bartender to handle tips in that way, then the user's response might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe user's response of not tipping and the bartender's refusal to serve could be a conflict of expectations. The user might have felt their autonomy was taken away by the automatic tip, while the bartender might have felt entitled to the tip. The user's decision to not tip after the bartender's action could be a justified protest against unadvertised practices, but refusing to tip in general is socially frowned upon.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the bartender was supposed to disclose the tip, then the user's reaction is understandable. However, if the user's response was to not tip at all, that could be seen as punishing the bartender for a policy that might be standard, even if not communicated well. The user might not be in the wrong if the bartender didn't follow proper procedures. On the other hand, refusing to tip could be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the automatic tip.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong (B) if the bartender didn't inform them of the tip policy. But if the user's refusal was an overreaction, then they might be at fault. It's a bit of a gray area, but considering the bartender added the tip without informing, the user's protest is justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
