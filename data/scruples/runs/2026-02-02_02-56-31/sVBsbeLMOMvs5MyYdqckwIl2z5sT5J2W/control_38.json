      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought 4 drinks for them, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The writer was drunk but still noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The writer is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending. However, the bartender added the tip without asking, which the writer found offensive. The writer was drunk but not too drunk to understand what was happening. \n\nOn one hand, the bartender's action of automatically adding a tip might be standard practice, but the writer felt it was taking advantage of their state. On the other hand, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate, especially since employees often rely on tips. However, the writer's reasoning was that the bartender was trying to exploit their intoxication, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service if they didn't tip seems extreme. It's possible that the establishment has a policy of mandatory tipping, but the writer's refusal could be a stand against that practice. Alternatively, the writer might have just wanted to tip a smaller amount based on their own discretion, especially since they had bought drinks for friends, implying they were generous in another way.\n\nI think the key points are the automatic addition of the tip without consent and the writer's reaction. The writer might not be in the wrong if the tip was added without their knowledge. However, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as problematic. But since the bartender added it without asking, the writer's refusal could be justified as standing up for their right to choose their tip. So maybe the answer is B, the writer isn't in the wrong.\n"
