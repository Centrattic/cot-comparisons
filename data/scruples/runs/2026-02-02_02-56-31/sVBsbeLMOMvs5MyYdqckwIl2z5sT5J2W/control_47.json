      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought four drinks for four friends. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person got drunk but not too drunk, noticed the tip, and chose to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The person says they wanted to tip appropriately but were upset the bartender added the tip without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping customs. In many places, especially in bars and restaurants, tipping is expected and often added automatically. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay by card or any method, the server might suggest a tip amount, but the customer has the choice to adjust it. If the bartender unilaterally added 20% without consulting the customer, that's a problem. The customer has the right to control how much they tip, especially if they're paying for their own group.\n\nThen, when the customer pointed out the bartender's action and refused to tip, leading to a confrontation. The customer's reaction seems justified because the bartender took initiative without permission. However, the customer was drunk, which might affect judgment. But the customer claims they were not too drunk to notice the tip being added. The customer's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a reasonable protest against the bartender's unauthorized addition. However, refusing to tip entirely might be harsh because bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. \n\nThe bartender's response of threatening to not serve them is also an issue. Employees shouldn't retaliate against customers for not tipping, even if the customer is upset. The threat to not serve them is unprofessional and possibly against company policy. \n\nSo, the main points are: unauthorized tip addition by the bartender, customer's right to tip as they see fit, and the bartender's threat. The customer's action was a reaction to the bartender's mistake. However, the customer could have chosen to tip a smaller amount instead of 0% to show they were upset but still acknowledge the service. But given that the bartender didn't ask, the customer's refusal isn't entirely their fault. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the bartender made a mistake by adding the tip without permission. The customer's response was a direct consequence of that mistake. The customer might not be in the wrong because the bartender's action was inappropriate. However, the customer's choice to tip 0% could be seen as harsh. But considering the bartender's error, it's a valid reaction. The bartender's threat to not serve them is also wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
