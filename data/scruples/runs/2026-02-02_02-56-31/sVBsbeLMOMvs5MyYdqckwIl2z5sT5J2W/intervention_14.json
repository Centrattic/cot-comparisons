      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought them drinks, and the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they responded by not tipping at all, which led the bartender to threaten not to serve them again.\n\nHmm. So, first, in many places, tips are supposed to be left at the customer's discretion. However, there's a common expectation that you should tip service staff, especially in the US where tips are a significant part of their income. But the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. That's a bit iffy. Normally, when you pay with a credit card, sometimes the tip is pre-added, but in a cash situation, the server usually handles it. \n\nWait, the user says the bartender \"put a 20% tip without telling me.\" How exactly did that happen? If it was a cash payment, maybe the bartender added the tip on their own. If it was a credit card, maybe the user was charged a tip automatically. But the user was there, so they must have noticed the bartender doing something. Maybe the bartender tried to add the tip to the bill and the user refused. \n\nThe user got angry because the bartender tried to add a tip without permission, especially since they were drunk. The user then decided to not tip at all, which led to a confrontation. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them again if they didn't tip. \n\nSo, is the user at fault? On one hand, they were in a public place and the bartender tried to add a tip without consent. The user might feel disrespected that the bartender assumed they would tip. On the other hand, not tipping at all is a strong response. Even if the bartender was wrong to add the tip without asking, a zero tip could be seen as a poor response. The user could have argued politely for a lower tip instead of 20%, but instead chose to tip 0%, which might be seen as retaliatory. \n\nAlso, the bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is problematic. That's their right as a business, but threatening to not serve a customer could be against the establishment's policy. However, the user's immediate reaction was to not tip at all, which is not the typical expectation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the bartender might have been wrong to add the tip without consent, but the user's zero tip is also an issue. The user could have handled it differently, maybe by discussing the appropriate tip amount instead of cutting it to zero. Therefore, the user might share some responsibility here. But maybe not entirely. The bartender's action was the initial problem, so the user's response, while strong, could be justified as a reaction to being taken advantage of. \n\nBut in the end, the user didn't tip at all, which is considered rude in many contexts. So maybe they are in the wrong because even if the bartender was wrong, the response was excessive. Alternatively, the bartender shouldn't have assumed the tip. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because not tipping is generally expected as poor behavior, regardless of the reason. Even if the bartender was wrong to add the tip, the user could have still left a smaller tip instead of none. The confrontation and zero tip might make the user responsible.\n"
