      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person went to a club with friends and invited four of them to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, tipping norms can vary by culture and establishment. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is standard for services like bartending. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, the customer is expected to decide the tip amount, even if they're drunk. The bartender's action of automatically adding 20% without asking could be seen as overstepping, especially since it's common for tips to be part of the total payment that the customer manually enters.\n\nThe customer's response to tip 0% as a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized addition is a bit of a retaliation. They felt disrespected by the bartender taking initiative without permission. But in doing so, the customer didn't just remove the tip; they actively tipped 0%, which is below the usual standard even if the bartender wasn't supposed to do it. The bartender then threatened not to serve them, which is a possible consequence.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The initial act of the bartender adding a tip without asking is questionable. Bartenders usually rely on tips for a significant part of their income, so if they're adding a tip without permission, that might be against the club's policy or the customer's expectations. However, the customer's response to not tip at all, even after the bartender corrected the situation, could be seen as counterproductive. If the bartender had a policy of adding a default tip, the customer might have been within their right to adjust it, but removing it entirely and then not adding any might have been a harsh reaction.\n\nBut wait, the customer said they were willing to tip an appropriate amount if the bartender had asked. The fact that the bartender didn't communicate and just added the tip led to the conflict. So the customer's decision to not tip might be a result of the bartender's lack of communication. However, in some places, especially if it's a cashless system, the customer might not have the option to adjust the tip, or the bartender might be using a system where tips are automatically applied. If the club or bartender's policy allows for that, the customer might have a right to object, but if the system is set up to add tips, maybe the customer should have known or accepted it.\n\nAnother angle: when you pay with a card, sometimes a prompt asks if you want to add a tip, and the customer can choose not to. If the bartender used their own initiative to set the tip instead of using the system's prompts, that's different. The customer's right to decide the tip amount is important. If the bartender is supposed to ask, then the bartender is in the wrong. If the system allows the bartender to add a tip without the customer's input, then maybe the customer is being unreasonable for not tipping at all.\n\nAlso, the context of being drunk plays a role. The customer was in a state where they might have been more sensitive to being taken advantage of. The bartender's threat to not serve them if they don't tip is also a strong response. In some cases, if a customer refuses to tip, the establishment can refuse service, but it's a matter of policy. If the bartender is supposed to handle such situations, maybe he was justified in his response, but if he acted unprofessionally, the customer might have a point.\n\nSo, the main factors here are: the bartender's right to add a tip without consent, the customer's right to adjust or not tip, and the appropriateness of their reaction. If the bartender was allowed to add tips automatically, the customer's refusal might be seen as their choice, but the customer's action of tipping 0% as a protest could be seen as a misstep. However, if the bartender didn't follow the usual procedure (like using a tip screen), the customer might be justified in not tipping. It's a bit of a gray area. The customer's intention was to be fair but felt disrespected. The bartender's action might have been against the customer's autonomy. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not tipping, but there could be a better way to handle it, like just removing the automatic tip and leaving a proper one. The answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the bartender's unauthorized addition of a tip could be the main issue here, and the customer's reaction, while perhaps extreme, was a response to that.\n"
