      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not tipping a bartender after the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer. The customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip, so they decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is customary. Bartenders, servers, etc., often rely on tips as part of their income. However, the situation here is that the bartender added a tip without the customer's knowledge. That's a bit unusual. Normally, the tip is added by the customer at the time of payment. If the bartender added it without asking, that could be seen as deceptive or taking advantage. \n\nThe customer was drunk but not incapacitated. The key point here is whether the bartender's action was appropriate. If the establishment has a policy of adding a service charge, usually that's disclosed beforehand. If the bartender did this on his own, that's different. The customer's reaction might be justified if they felt the tip was coerced. \n\nHowever, the customer responded by leaving the 0% tip, which could be seen as cutting off the bartender's income. The bartender then refused service, which might be within his rights if the customer refuses to pay the tip. So the customer didn't pay the tip, leading to the conflict. \n\nOn one hand, the bartender shouldn't add a tip without consent. On the other, the customer might have a point in refusing to accept that. But in practice, the customer's refusal to tip could be seen as a counteraction. But in most cases, the expectation is that customers tip unless there's a reason not to. The customer's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of their intoxicated state. \n\nBut even if the customer was drunk, the bartender should have been professional. However, the customer's decision to not tip in response might be considered wrong because they could have just left the 0% tip and not engaged in the conflict. Alternatively, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. If the bartender's action was improper, the customer's response might be justified. But usually, the expectation is to tip, so not tipping could be seen as wrong. However, the bartender's behavior might have been the initial problem. \n\nI need to weigh these factors. The key points: bartender added tip without permission, customer was drunk but not unable to act, customer refused to tip in response. The bartender's refusal to serve is a bit of a strong reaction. \n\nIn some places, mandatory tips are allowed if disclosed, but if not, it's illegal. So if the bartender added a tip without the customer's knowledge, that might be against local laws. The customer's action could be defending against that. \n\nSo, perhaps the author is not in the wrong because the bartender's action was inappropriate. But if the customer could have just left a 0% tip without confronting, but the bartender's initial action was the main issue. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
