      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user went to a club with friends and invited four friends to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then told him he wouldn't serve him anymore if he didn't tip. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, first, I need to think about standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected as part of the service. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. So when the bartender added a 20% tip, maybe that's an automatic gratuity for a group? Sometimes places add a service charge for large groups.\n\nBut the user didn't know the tip was added. The bartender didn't inform them, so the user might not have had a choice. The user then decided not to tip, which led to the bartender refusing to serve. Is that a fair reaction? Bartenders can't just refuse service unless there's a safety issue or something. But maybe the user's action of not tipping after the automatic charge is seen as being rude or disrespectful. \n\nWait, but the user was already charged 20% without their knowledge. Maybe the user thought they were being overcharged and wanted to correct it. However, in many cases, automatic gratuities are non-negotiable, even if they're added without prior notice. If the user didn't like the tip being added, maybe they should have disputed it at the time, but they didn't. Instead, they left a 0% tip, which might be seen as a refusal to pay any tip beyond the automatic one. \n\nBut the user's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice the tip. So maybe the user is asserting their right to control their own tipping, even if drunk. However, in the service industry, customers are expected to tip, and not doing so can be considered rude or even a threat to the employee's income. \n\nThe bartender's response of refusing to serve might be harsh, but employees can sometimes refuse service if they feel disrespected. However, it's not clear if that's within the bartender's rights. Also, the initial automatic tip might not be a good practice on the bartender's part, but the user's response could be seen as a conflict. \n\nSo, on one hand, the bartender added a tip without informing, which might be against the user's expectations, but on the other hand, not tipping in response could be seen as the user's fault because they were aware of the tip and chose to not add any. The user might be in the wrong because they didn't pay any tip, even if they thought the automatic one was unfair. Alternatively, the bartender is in the wrong for adding a tip without consent. \n\nBut in many places, automatic gratuities are standard for groups. If the user was part of a group, maybe the 20% was a service charge, and the user should have just paid that. By leaving 0%, they might be trying to double-dip and avoid tipping further. However, the user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't add it without saying. But if it's a standard practice, maybe it's not the bartender's fault. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't tip, even though the bartender added a tip. The user's response was to not tip, which is not the standard practice. Bartenders rely on tips, so not tipping could be considered rude and inconsiderate. The bartender refused service, which is a strong reaction, but maybe the user's action was the main issue here. So the answer might be A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
