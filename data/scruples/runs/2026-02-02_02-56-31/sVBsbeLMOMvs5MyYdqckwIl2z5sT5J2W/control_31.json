      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person claims they were willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves but didn't want the bartender to automatically add a tip without informing them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected, and sometimes a default tip is added, especially in places like bars or restaurants. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when a default tip is added, it's part of the transaction, and the customer is aware of it when they pay. If the bartender didn't inform them, that could be an issue. The customer felt that the bartender was taking advantage of their inebriated state, which adds another layer.\n\nThe customer's response was to tip 0%, which directly countered the bartender's added tip. The bartender then refused service. Refusing to serve someone can be a problem, but if the customer is causing a disturbance or being abusive, the bartender might have a right to. However, in this case, the customer was just trying to correct what they saw as an unauthorized tip.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's state of being drunk. While they were drunk, they mention they weren't too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. This implies they were coherent enough to make a decision, so the bartender might argue that the customer had the capacity to pay the tip. However, the customer felt they were being taken advantage of because they were under the influence, which could be a valid concern if the bartender knew they were impaired.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the customer's right to choose their own tip. If the bartender added a tip without consent, even if it's standard practice, it's technically against the customer's autonomy. The customer's refusal to pay the added tip could be seen as their right, especially if they were not informed.\n\nBut from the bartender's perspective, they might rely on tips as part of their income. Refusing service because a customer wants to adjust the tip might be within their rights if the customer is causing a scene or being disrespectful. However, in this case, the customer was responding to an action the bartender took, not being disruptive. The bartender's response of refusing to serve them could be harsh, especially if the customer was willing to offer an appropriate tip themselves.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, tipping is generally voluntary unless specified by the establishment's policy. If the club or bar has a policy of adding a service charge, they should inform customers. If they don't, the customer might not be obligated to pay that. However, in many places, a service charge can be added as part of the bill, especially in certain venues. The customer's objection might be valid if there's no such policy in place.\n\nEmotionally, the customer felt disrespected by the bartender adding the tip without consent, especially while they were drunk. The bartender, on the other hand, might feel that the customer was being unreasonable by not paying the tip. The situation escalated because of the drunk state of the customer, which could affect how the interaction is perceived.\n\nIn summary, the bartender adding a tip without informing the customer might be the root of the problem. The customer's response, while perhaps abrupt, was in reaction to an action that wasn't transparent. The bartender's refusal to serve could be seen as a harsh response, especially if the customer was willing to tip an appropriate amount. However, the customer's own actions of tipping 0% might be seen as inconsiderate, given that tips are a significant part of service workers' income.\n\nThe key factors are whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without informing the customer and how the customer's response was proportionate. If the establishment's policy allows for automatic tips, then the customer might be at fault for not paying. If not, the customer might be justified in their response. Since the scenario doesn't mention a policy, it's more about the bartender's individual action. Therefore, the bartender might be at fault for adding the tip without consent, and the customer was asserting their right to tip as they saw fit, which could mean they're not in the wrong.\n"
