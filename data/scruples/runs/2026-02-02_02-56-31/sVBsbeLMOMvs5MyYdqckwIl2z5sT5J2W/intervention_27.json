      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. Let me break down the details.\n\nThey went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user was drunk but could notice the bartender adding the tip on their own. They responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user claims they were willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves but the bartender adding the tip without permission upset them.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. However, it's usually up to the customer to decide the amount, unless the establishment has an automatic gratuity policy (common in groups or during happy hours). The user might not know if the bar adds a tip by default. But here, the bartender added it without informing them. That's a key point.\n\nThe user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So they made a conscious decision to not tip because they felt the bartender was taking advantage. The bartender then refused service, which raises questions about his actions. If the bartender added a tip without permission, that's a problem. However, in some places, automatic gratuities are standard, but they should be disclosed. If the bartender did this without explanation, maybe the user had a right to be upset.\n\nBut the user's response was to tip 0%, which might be seen as retaliatory. However, the user claims they were willing to tip an appropriate amount, so maybe it's about the principle of the bartender not disclosing the tip. The bartender's threat to not serve them could be against the law in some places, as tipping is supposed to be optional unless the establishment has a policy.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If the bartender added a tip without permission, the user might have a valid reason to refuse. But generally, tipping is expected, and not tipping could be seen as rude regardless. But the situation is complicated by the bartender's actions. Maybe the user isn't in the wrong because the bartender didn't inform them. But if tipping is customary and the user refused, that's a different angle.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the automatic tip was disclosed. If it wasn't, the user has a point. However, the user's refusal to tip at all might still be seen as inconsiderate, but the bartender shouldn't have added it without permission. The bartender's response (threatening not to serve) might be the bigger issue here. So the user might not be in the wrong (B), because the bartender didn't inform them and the user's reaction was a justified response to that.\n"
