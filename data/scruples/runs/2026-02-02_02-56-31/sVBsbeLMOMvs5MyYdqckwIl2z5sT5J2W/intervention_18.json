      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user went to a club with friends and invited four people for four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user, who was pretty drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% in response, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them further. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip around 15-20% for good service. However, the user is upset because the bartender added the tip without informing them. That's a key point. Normally, when you pay with a card, the terminal might let you add a tip, but if the bartender set the tip amount without the customer's knowledge, that could be an issue. The user might feel disrespected or think the bartender is trying to take advantage of their inebriated state.\n\nBut the user's response was to tip 0%, which is a direct reaction. That could be seen as a form of protest. However, the bartender's refusal to serve them after that is a problem. Employees can't just deny service for not tipping, right? Or can they? Wait, in some places, businesses can ask for a minimum tip or have policies, but if the customer is paying the bill, the bartender can't necessarily refuse service for not tipping. So maybe the bartender overstepped by threatening not to serve them. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might not have been aware that the bartender was trying to add a tip, so maybe they should have checked the total or asked before changing the tip to 0. However, the user was drunk, which might affect their judgment. But being drunk doesn't exempt someone from understanding basic transactions, especially if they were still coherent enough to notice the tip being added.\n\nAnother angle: the user invited four friends for four drinks. So maybe they were part of a group where the bartender assumed they'd want to tip. But the user's decision to not tip after being proactive about it could be seen as a stand against the bartender's action. However, the bartender's job might depend on tips, so the user's 0% tip could be unfair to the employee. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without the customer's knowledge. That's a breach of trust. The user, in response, could have questioned the tip amount or asked for the total, but instead chose to leave 0%, which is a confrontational move. The bartender's refusal to serve might be a policy issue, but employees shouldn't be the ones enforcing that. The manager should handle such situations. \n\nSo, who's at fault here? The bartender might be in the wrong for adding the tip without consent, but the user's reaction could also be seen as a reasonable protest. However, refusing service because of not tipping is on the bartender's side. Therefore, the user might not be in the wrong for standing up to the bartender's actions, even if the method was a bit confrontational.\n"
