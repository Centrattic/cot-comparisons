      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed and responded by tipping 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person claims they were ready to tip appropriately but the bartender's automatic addition of 20% was a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially for service like bartending, a 15-20% tip is typical. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, tips are the customer's choice, even if businesses suggest a default. If the bartender just assumed a 20% tip without asking, that might be an issue because the customer has the right to choose. \n\nBut the person was drunk. Being intoxicated can impair judgment, but the question is whether the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission was appropriate. If the bartender is in a position where he can enforce a minimum tip, that could be problematic. However, in most cases, the customer is responsible for tipping, and the bartender can't force them to tip. But the customer also can't force the bartender to serve them, as the bartender can choose not to serve if they feel disrespected or if there's an issue.\n\nThe person's response was to tip 0%, which is against the norm, but their reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk customers. That's a valid concern because if someone is drunk, they might not realize they're being overcharged or forced to tip. However, the person did acknowledge they were willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves but the bartender's action was the issue. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? Well, they didn't tip, which is unusual, but their reasoning was based on the bartender's misconduct. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission, especially when the customer was drunk. However, the person's response of not tipping at all might be seen as extreme, but given the context, they might have felt justified. \n\nIn terms of who is more at fault, the bartender likely made a mistake by adding the tip without asking. The customer's reaction, while harsh, was a response to that. So the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The answer could be B (No), because the bartender's action was improper.\n"
