      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the usual tipping customs. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in service industries like bars and restaurants. The standard is usually around 15-20%, right? So if the bartender added 20% automatically, maybe that's standard for the establishment. But the author didn't like that the tip was added without their knowledge. They were drunk but still aware of it. So maybe the issue is about autonomy in tipping.\n\nWait, some places do automatically add a gratuity, especially for large groups or events. Maybe the club had a policy where they add a tip for groups. If that's the case, the author might not have been aware of the policy. But the problem here is that the bartender added the tip without informing them. The author felt it was an advantage taken because they were drunk. So they decided to not tip, which led to the bartender refusing service.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the bartender added the tip without consent, maybe the author is justified in objecting. However, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as rude or against social norms. But the author's response was to leave the tip as 0%, which is going against the usual expectation. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking might be the root issue here. If the establishment has a policy that allows for automatic gratuity, the author might have had a misunderstanding. On the other hand, if the bartender did it on his own, that's different.\n\nAlso, considering the author was drunk, maybe they acted on impulse. But they mention they weren't too drunk to notice the tip being added. So they made a conscious decision to not tip. The bartender's threat to not serve them if they didn't tip could be a problem too. Maybe the author had a right to question the tip, but refusing to tip might be seen as their mistake.\n\nIn the end, while the bartender's initial action might not have been appropriate if it wasn't clear, the author's response of tipping 0% could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the author is at least partially at fault. But maybe not entirely, since the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. But in many cases, automatic gratuity is part of the bill, so the author might be responsible for paying it. If they didn't like the automatic tip, they could have adjusted it later, but leaving 0% was probably too harsh. So maybe they are in the wrong.\n"
