      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks, paid, and the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk, didn't tip at all, told the bartender not to take advantage, and the bartender then refused to serve them. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping expectations. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and expected. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the twist here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, when you pay with a card, sometimes the tip is pre-added, but it's usually up to the customer to adjust. If the bartender didn't inform the author that a tip was being added, that might be an issue. The author felt disrespected because the bartender assumed control over the tipping without consent, especially when they were under the influence.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't tip at all. Even if the bartender added 20% without asking, the author could have just accepted it or adjusted it. Instead, they left 0%, which is a clear refusal. The bartender then refused service, which is within their rights in many places if a customer is being abusive or refuses to tip. However, the author's response was to take offense at the automatic tip and not tip back. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, tipping is a social norm, and not tipping at all, especially in a place where tips are expected, is generally frowned upon. The fact that the bartender added a tip without permission is a point against the bartender, but the author's response was to not tip at all, which is a breach of the norm. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without informing might be against the establishment's policy as well. \n\nBut in terms of accountability, the customer's choice to tip is their right. If the bartender was allowed to add tips automatically, that's part of the establishment's policy. The author could have pointed out the tip and adjusted it, but instead, they responded in a confrontational way. The bartender's refusal to serve might be justified if the author was being disrespectful. However, the author's main issue was with the automatic tip, which is a valid concern if it wasn't disclosed. \n\nBut legally and socially, the expectation is that you tip. Even if the bartender made a mistake, the author's response was to not tip, which is more severe. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not tipping despite the bartender's error. But if the bartender didn't have the right to add tips without consent, then the author's reaction is understandable. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't tip at all, which is a major breach of social norms, regardless of the bartender's mistake. However, the bartender's action was also inappropriate. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide. In most AITA scenarios, if you don't tip at all, you're often seen as at fault. So the answer might be A. But the fact that the bartender added a tip without permission complicates it. Maybe the answer is B because the bartender overstepped, and the author's response was justified. But I'm not sure. Different people have different views on tipping. Some might say the author is in the right for objecting to automatic tips. Others might say that not tipping is wrong regardless. It's a bit of a toss-up, but in the AITA framework, the norm is usually that not tipping is bad, so AITA answers often go with the person who didn't tip being in the wrong. But the bartender's action is a factor here. Maybe the answer is B because the bartender was at fault for adding the tip without permission, and the author's response was a reasonable protest. But I'm not certain. The key is whether the author's action was wrong. If the author's right to decide not to tip isn't negated by the bartender's mistake, then maybe B. But if the author should have just accepted the tip or adjusted it, then A. Hmm. This is tricky.\n"
