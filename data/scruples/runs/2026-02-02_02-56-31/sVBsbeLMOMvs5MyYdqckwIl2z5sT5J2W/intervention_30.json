I invited them (4 people) to 4 drinks. When I was paying, the bartender himself put a 20% tip without telling me. Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. So that's 4 drinks per person for four friends, totaling 16 drinks? Or maybe four drinks in total for the group? The wording is a bit unclear, but maybe that's not the main point.\n\nThen, when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the user. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by not tipping at all, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall standard tipping customs. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The typical range is 15-20%, though it can vary. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the 20% without consulting the customer. Is that acceptable? Usually, while some places might automatically add a tip, especially in clubs or certain establishments, the customer should be informed. If the bartender did this without the user's knowledge, that could be an issue. The user felt it was an attempt to take advantage, which is why they refused to tip.\n\nBut the user's response was to tip 0%, which is another problem. Even if the bartender was wrong to add the tip without permission, the appropriate action might have been to correct the tip amount after the fact, not to refuse entirely. Also, the bartender's response of refusing service is a bit extreme, but in some places, especially where tipping is expected, refusing to serve for not tipping could be within their rights (though that's a different issue).\n\nSo, if the user is in the wrong, it's because they didn't tip at all despite the service provided. If the bartender was wrong, it's for adding the tip without informing the customer. The user might have a point about the bartender's action, but their own action of not tipping at all is problematic. The user could have adjusted the tip after realizing the error, but instead chose to retaliate, which led to the bartender refusing service.\n\nIn many cases, the expectation is that you tip for the service you receive. Even if there was a misunderstanding, the user's response of 0% tip is not appropriate. So, the answer might be A (you are in the wrong). However, some might argue the bartender's initial action was wrong, but the user's action is the main issue here.\n"
