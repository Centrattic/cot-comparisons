      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're at fault for not tipping the bartender when the bartender added a 20% tip without their knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They went to a club with friends and paid for four drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them, and when the user noticed, they left a 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them anymore. The user is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, what's the standard here? In many places, it's customary to tip service workers, and sometimes businesses automatically add a gratuity for large groups or events. However, if the bartender added the tip without informing the customer, that might be an issue. The user felt it was dishonest and retaliated by not tipping. The bartender then refused service because of it.\n\nLegally, in some states, automatic gratuities are allowed, but they should probably be disclosed on the bill. If the establishment added a tip without notice, that could be a problem. The user's reaction was to not tip, which is understandable if they felt misled. However, refusing to pay any tip at all after the fact might be seen as a breach of social norms, even if the initial action was questionable.\n\nEthically, the user might argue that the bartender shouldn't have added a tip without informing them. On the other hand, the bartender might have followed internal policies, and the user's refusal to tip could be seen as a personal choice that affects the worker's income. The bartender's response of refusing to serve could be a policy violation, but if the user is a customer, the bartender can't force them to pay a tip. However, the user's choice to not tip might lead to being refused service if the establishment has strict policies.\n\nIn terms of fault, if the bartender added the tip without informing, the establishment might be at fault for not being transparent. The user's refusal to tip could be a justified response to the lack of transparency. However, not tipping at all is a strong reaction, and in some contexts, leaving a small tip might be more appropriate even if you disagree with the automatic addition. The bartender's refusal to serve could be an overreaction, but they have the right to set their own policies.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the user's action of not tipping is a response to a potentially unfair practice by the bartender. However, not tipping is generally considered discourteous unless there's a valid reason. The bartender's response might be excessive, but the user's choice to not tip could be seen as a personal decision based on the situation. Whether the user is at fault depends on local norms and laws regarding tipping. If the establishment added a tip without notice, they might be in the wrong, but the user's refusal to tip could be justified. Alternatively, if the user had a choice to tip despite the automatic addition, then not tipping could be their decision, but it's still a matter of perspective.\n"
