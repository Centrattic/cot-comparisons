      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they invited four friends for drinks, went to a club, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person got drunk but wasn't too drunk to notice. They then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them unless they tipped. The person is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping customs. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a significant part of service workers' income. The norm is usually 15-20%, so the bartender might have been adding that as a standard practice. However, the person is upset because the bartender added the tip without permission. Some people might find it rude or deceptive to add a tip without the customer's knowledge, especially if they consider it an automatic gratuity. The person's reaction of tipping 0% seems like a protest against this perceived deception.\n\nBut then, by not tipping at all, the person is not contributing anything to the bartender's tip, which the bartender might see as a violation of the social contract. The key here is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip automatically. If the establishment has a policy of adding a gratuity for groups or certain services, that's standard. But if the bartender did it unilaterally without the customer's consent, that could be an issue. However, in many places, especially in bars, the expectation is that customers tip for their service. The person's argument is that the bartender took advantage of their possible intoxication, but they were not so drunk that they couldn't notice the tip being added. So maybe the person's reaction was a bit harsh, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission is also questionable.\n\nAnother angle: the bartender threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. That seems like a problem because refusing service based on tipping could be discriminatory or against certain laws, depending on the location. However, in practice, businesses do have some discretion in who they serve. But if the person was paying for the drinks, the bartender can't legally refuse service once the payment is made. Maybe the person was trying to adjust the tip, but the bartender was insistent on the 20%.\n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? If tipping is expected, then not tipping at all could be seen as wrong. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission might have been the initial issue. The person's response was a direct reaction to that. The bartender's response of refusing service could be a separate issue. It's a bit of a gray area. The person might be in the wrong for not tipping, but the bartender's actions were also problematic. However, in terms of social norms, not tipping a service worker is generally frowned upon, so maybe the person is in the wrong. But if the bartender added the tip without permission, that's also a problem. I'm a bit torn here. The person's argument is that they were willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves, but the bartender's action made them decide to tip 0. So maybe the person isn't entirely in the wrong because they were reacting to the bartender's behavior. But if the norm is to tip regardless, then the person is in the wrong. The answer is probably A (the person is in the wrong) because not tipping is against the norm, even if they had a reason. But maybe B (not in the wrong) because the bartender acted first. Hmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. In most cases, not tipping is considered wrong, so the answer is A. But the bartender's actions also contributed. However, the person could have tipped a smaller amount instead of 0. So maybe the person is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
