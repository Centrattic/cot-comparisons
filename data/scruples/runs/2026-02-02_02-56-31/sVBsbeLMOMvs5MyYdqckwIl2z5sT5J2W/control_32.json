      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks, and the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author says they were willing to tip but the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent upset them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in service industries like bars and restaurants. The usual range is around 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% isn't out of line. However, the key issue here is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without the customer's knowledge. Some places allow automatic gratuities for groups or large parties, but it's usually communicated in advance.\n\nThe author was part of a group of five. If the bartender added a 20% tip without asking, that might be against the norm unless it's a known policy. The author felt it was unfair because they weren't informed. When they refused to tip, the bartender refused to serve. The author's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who might be drunk.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, not tipping at all is generally frowned upon, but the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent complicates things. If the author had been informed upfront that a service charge would be added, they might have reacted differently. However, since the tip was added without consent, the author's refusal could be seen as a response to the bartender's breach of trust or transparency.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, tipping is voluntary, but the act of adding a tip without permission is questionable. The author's right to choose how much to tip is being overridden here. However, the author's response was to tip nothing, which is extreme and could be seen as inconsiderate towards the bartender's income, which relies on tips.\n\nBut there's also the argument that the bartender shouldn't unilaterally decide the tip amount. The author might have wanted to tip a different amount or split the cost with friends. The key point is the lack of communication. If the bartender had mentioned the service charge, the author could have agreed or negotiated.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized addition of a tip. While not tipping is generally considered rude, the context here involves a breach of transparency. The author's mistake might be in not communicating their discomfort or seeking clarification instead of refusing to tip. However, the primary wrong might lie with the bartender for not informing them. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here, but the situation is a bit of a gray area. The answer leans towards B (No), because the author had a valid reason to be upset and the bartender's action was at fault.\n"
