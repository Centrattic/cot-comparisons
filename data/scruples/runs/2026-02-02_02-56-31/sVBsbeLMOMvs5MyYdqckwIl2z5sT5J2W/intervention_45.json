I invited them (4 people) to 4 drinks. When I was paying, the bartender himself put a 20% tip without telling me. Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender after he added a 20% tip without telling them. They were at a club with friends, and when paying, the bartender automatically added the tip. The user got drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they zero-tipped the bartender, telling him not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them, saying they had to tip. The user wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nHmm, first, I need to recall tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is common, but it's supposed to be optional. However, some businesses automatically add a tip, which might be against the law. So if the bartender added a tip without the customer's knowledge or consent, that could be an issue. \n\nBut the user didn't tip at all, which might be problematic. But maybe the issue is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. The user felt they were being taken advantage of, especially while drunk. The bartender's response of refusing to serve them if they didn't tip seems like a problem. Maybe the bartender was wrong to add the tip without consent and then to refuse service for not tipping, which is perhaps against their policy or laws. \n\nSo the user's argument is that the bartender took advantage by adding the tip without asking, hence they refused to tip. But in some places, tipping is required by law, but in others, it's not. If the bartender added the tip without permission, that's a violation. The user's response might be justified if the bartender was acting improperly. However, the user not tipping could be seen as a response to the bartender's mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should have just tipped the appropriate amount regardless, even if the bartender made a mistake. But if the bartender was trying to take advantage, the user's action could be justified. Also, the bartender threatening not to serve them if they don't tip is problematic because service shouldn't be contingent on tipping. \n\nSo the key points here are whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without consent and whether the user had the right to refuse. If the bartender was wrong to add the tip, then the user's response might be justified. But if tipping is expected, then the user might be in the wrong. However, the bartender's refusal to serve could be a bigger issue. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards the user not being in the wrong because the bartender added the tip without permission, which is an issue. The user's reaction, while possibly harsh, is a response to that. Also, the bartender's refusal to serve if not tipped is against service laws in many places. Therefore, the user might not be at fault.\n"
