      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is at fault. The situation is that the user went to a club with friends, bought four drinks for them, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them further if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars, tipping is customary and often expected. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. Adding a 20% tip automatically might be a common practice in some establishments, but the key issue here is that the bartender didn't inform the customer. The user felt it was wrong because the bartender added the tip without permission, which the user perceived as taking advantage of their possible inebriation.\n\nThe user's response was to tip 0%, which is a direct rejection of the added tip. They were willing to tip appropriately but not let the bartender unilaterally decide the amount. The bartender then threatened not to serve them. Now, the question is whether the user was wrong for not tipping.\n\nFrom a standard perspective, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, but the twist here is the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent. If the bartender didn't inform the user, maybe that's where the mistake is. However, the user's decision to leave 0% might be a reaction to that perceived overreach. The user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip amount, especially when someone is drunk. But is it the user's fault for not tipping, or the bartender's for adding the tip without asking?\n\nAlso, the bartender's response of refusing service could be problematic. If the user decided not to tip after the fact, the bartender might not have the right to deny service unless there's a policy against such behavior. But the user's main action is not tipping, and the question is whether that makes them at fault.\n\nIn many cultures, tipping is expected, so not tipping could be seen as rude. However, the user's justification is that the bartender added the tip without consent. So there's a conflict between the user's right to decide their own tipping and the bartender's practice. \n\nI think the answer might be that the user isn't entirely at fault because the bartender's action was inappropriate. However, the user's response of not tipping could still be seen as inconsiderate. But since the bartender took initiative without asking, the user's reaction is understandable. So maybe the answer is B, No, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
