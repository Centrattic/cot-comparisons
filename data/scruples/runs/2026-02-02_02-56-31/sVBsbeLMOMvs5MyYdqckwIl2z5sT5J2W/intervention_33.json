      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves but was upset that the bartender added the tip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the usual etiquette around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in bars and restaurants, often around 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the user's consent. Normally, the tip is added by the customer, not the server, unless the establishment automatically adds a service charge. But in this case, it seems like the bartender himself put the tip in, which might not be standard practice. \n\nThe user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They felt that the bartender was taking advantage of their intoxication, which is a valid concern. However, the bartender's response of refusing service because of the lack of tip might be problematic. In some places, refusing service because a customer doesn't tip could be considered discrimination or a violation of the customer's right to choose whether to tip or not. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender might rely on tips as a significant part of their income, and expecting a tip is part of their job. The user's decision to not tip at all could be seen as unfair to the bartender, especially if the bartender had already added the tip in good faith, thinking it was the standard practice. However, the bartender shouldn't have assumed the tip without the customer's approval. \n\nSo, there's a conflict here. The user was right to question the automatic addition of the tip, as it's not typical for a server to decide the tip amount without the customer's input. However, responding by not tipping at all might have been a harsh reaction. The user could have asked the bartender to remove the tip or discussed it, rather than refusing to tip entirely. \n\nThe bartender's refusal to serve them is also questionable. While they can refuse service for various reasons, doing so solely because a customer chose not to tip as much as the bartender wanted might be against the law in some jurisdictions. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user has a point in being upset about the automatic tip, but their response might have been excessive. They could have handled it more politely. The bartender also shouldn't have added the tip without informing the customer. So, both sides have some fault here. But the question is whether the user is in the wrong. \n\nSince the user was in a position to tip or not, and the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission was the initial issue, the user's reaction, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, is not entirely their fault. However, the user could have communicated better. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the bartender initiated the problem by adding the tip without consent, and the user's refusal to tip in response isn't entirely wrong, though it's a bit of a gray area.\n"
