      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author, being a bit drunk but not too much, noticed and decided to tip 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service staff like bartenders 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, when a tip is added automatically, the customer might not be aware until they see the receipt, but the author noticed it in real-time. The author's reaction could be based on a principle of not wanting to be overcharged, especially when they were already paying for multiple drinks. \n\nThe author was drunk but not to the point of not understanding. The bartender's action of adding the tip without informing might be seen as unethical, depending on the establishment's policy. However, some places do have automatic gratuities for large groups or during certain times. But the author didn't know about this policy, so it's a problem if it wasn't communicated beforehand. \n\nThe author's response of tipping 0% and accusing the bartender of taking advantage might be seen as confrontational. However, the bartender's refusal to serve is a significant point. Refusing service due to a disagreement over tipping could be problematic. The author might have been within their rights to dispute the automatic tip but the refusal to serve complicates things. \n\nBut if the bartender added the tip without informing the customer, that's a breach of trust. The author's stance is about not being taken advantage of, which is a valid concern. However, the author's decision to tip 0% in response might be seen as aggressive. The appropriate action would be to either remove the tip if possible or discuss the policy with the bartender. \n\nThe author's responsibility is to follow standard tipping practices unless they have a reason to believe the service was poor. Since the author didn't mention poor service, just the automatic tip, their reaction might be based on principle rather than service quality. However, the bartender's refusal to serve could be justified if they have a policy requiring tips, but that policy should be communicated to customers beforehand. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's fault might lie in not being aware of the establishment's tipping policy and reacting by not tipping, while the bartender's fault might be adding the tip without informing. However, the author's decision to tip 0% could be seen as wrong because it's customary to tip, even if the automatic addition was unwelcome. Alternatively, the author isn't at fault if the bartender violated transparency policies.\n"
