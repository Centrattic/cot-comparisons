      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice and then left 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, first, tipping customs vary, but in places like the US, tipping is expected for services, especially in restaurants and bars. Bartenders rely heavily on tips as part of their income, right? So the person not tipping could be seen as wrong. But the twist here is that the bartender added the tip without asking. Normally, you might choose your tip, but if the bartender just added it in, maybe that's an issue. \n\nWait, when you pay, the person might be using a card, and the terminal might allow the customer to choose the tip. If the bartender changed the percentage without the customer's consent, that could be problematic. The customer felt it was an advantage taken because they were drunk. But the bartender might argue that adding a tip is standard. \n\nSo the person's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't have assumed the tip. But the bartender might feel that their service requires a tip. The person is in the wrong here because even if the bartender added the tip without asking, the appropriate response would be to adjust it when presented with the bill. However, the person chose to leave zero, which is against the norm. Also, threatening not to serve is on the bartender, but the initial decision not to tip could be the person's mistake. \n\nAlternatively, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. But in many places, the customer is in control of the tip amount. If the bartender didn't ask or inform, maybe that's his error. But the person's response of zero is still a problem. So maybe the person is in the wrong for not tipping, regardless of the bartender's actions. Or maybe both are at fault. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's responsibility. The author's defense is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip. However, in most cases, the customer has control over the tip amount. If the bartender added it without asking, maybe the person is justified in not tipping because the bartender didn't let them choose. But if the person then leaves zero, they're not contributing, which is against the norm. \n\nI think the key here is whether the customer had the chance to adjust the tip. If the bartender added it without the customer's knowledge, then the customer might not be at fault for not tipping, because they were not given the opportunity to choose. However, once confronted, the customer should have adjusted it. But the customer was drunk. So maybe the bartender shouldn't have taken advantage of the customer's state. \n\nThis is a bit of a gray area. But generally, the customer is expected to tip, and the bartender might be wrong to add the tip without consent. However, the customer's response of zero is still problematic. But if the bartender didn't inform them, perhaps the customer is not entirely at fault. \n\nHmm. I'm torn. If the bartender added the tip without asking, maybe the person isn't responsible for that. But then, the person could have pointed it out and adjusted. But they were drunk. Maybe the bartender should have known better than to assume. \n\nI think the answer here might be that the person is not in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without their knowledge, especially when they were drunk. So the person's reaction is justified. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the person is at fault for not tipping regardless. \n\nIn many places, the expectation is that you tip. If the bartender added 20%, maybe the person should have left that and not argued. But if the bartender didn't inform them, that's an issue. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
