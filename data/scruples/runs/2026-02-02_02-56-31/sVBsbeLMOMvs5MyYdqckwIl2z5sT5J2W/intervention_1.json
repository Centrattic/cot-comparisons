      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did something wrong by not tipping the bartender. The situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by saying he won't serve them anymore if they don't tip. The user is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the bartender adding a tip without permission and the user's reaction. Normally, tipping is a voluntary gesture, but some places automatically add a tip, especially in certain regions or establishments. However, the user didn't know about this policy beforehand. The bartender didn't inform them that a tip would be added, which seems like a problem. \n\nThe user was drunk, which can affect judgment, but they were still aware enough to notice the tip being added. They responded by not tipping and confronting the bartender, leading to the bartender threatening to not serve them. The user's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's intoxicated. \n\nFrom the user's perspective, they felt misled because the tip wasn't disclosed. They wanted to tip appropriately on their own but were upset about the automatic addition. On the other hand, bartenders often rely on tips as part of their income, and some places do add a service charge automatically, which might be standard there. However, the lack of communication from the bartender is a red flag. \n\nThe user's response of tipping 0% was a direct reaction to the bartender's actions. The bartender then used the threat of not serving them as a response, which might be an overreaction. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user might not be entirely at fault. The bartender had a responsibility to disclose any automatic tips. The user was perhaps defending their own autonomy in deciding how much to tip. However, the confrontation could have been handled differently. The user's refusal to tip after the fact could be seen as a breach of social norms if the establishment does have a policy of adding a tip, which wasn't communicated. \n\nBut if the policy wasn't clear, the user's reaction is understandable. The bartender's threat to not serve them is also problematic. There's a balance between the user's right to choose their tip amount and the bartender's job depending on tips. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the user might be in the right because the bartender didn't inform them about the tip. The user's action was a response to being taken advantage of, and the bartender's threat was unprofessional. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
