I invited them (4 people) to 4 drinks. When I was paying, the bartender himself put a 20% tip without telling me. Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user went to a club with friends, invited four people for four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking, and the user, who was a bit drunk but not too much, decided to tip 0% in response. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, tipping norms vary by culture and establishment. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff. However, the user felt the bartender added the tip without their knowledge or consent, which might be an issue. The user's reaction could be seen as a justified stand against automatic gratuities, especially if the establishment didn't inform them beforehand. Some places do add a service charge for large groups or events, but it's usually mentioned on the bill.\n\nHowever, the user's response to tip 0% might be seen as a bit harsh. Even if the bartender added the tip, the user could have chosen to tip an appropriate amount themselves. Refusing to tip at all could be viewed as disrespectful, especially in industries where tips are a significant part of the employee's income. The bartender's refusal to serve further complicates things; threatening to not serve is unprofessional and possibly against the law, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nBut the user's main issue was the automatic tip without consent. If the establishment automatically added a tip without informing, that's a problem. In that case, the user was within their rights to question it. However, not tipping at all in response might be overreacting. A better approach might have been to express their concern and still leave a tip, or to dispute the automatic addition through proper channels rather than retaliate.\n\nSo, while the bartender's actions were unprofessional, the user's response of 0% tip could be seen as inconsiderate. The user might be in the wrong for not tipping at all, even if they were upset about the automatic addition. The optimal solution would be to handle it politely, perhaps by leaving a note or contacting management if the practice is problematic.\n"
