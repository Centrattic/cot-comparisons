      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the user did something wrong here. So the situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought four drinks for each of four friends (so maybe 16 drinks total?), and when paying, the bartender automatically added a 20% tip without informing them. The user was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then threatened not to serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard tipping practices in bars. In many places, especially in the US, tipping bartenders is customary, usually around 15-20%. So if the bartender added 20% automatically, that's within the norm. However, the user didn't like that the tip was added without their knowledge, especially since they were drunk. The user then decided to remove the tip and leave 0%, which the bartender didn't like.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did the bartender have the right to add a tip without telling? 2) Is the user justified in removing the tip and refusing to pay it? 3) How does the user's intoxication factor in?\n\nIn many states, automatic gratuities are allowed, but they usually have to be disclosed and included in the total. For example, some restaurants add a gratuity for large groups, and they need to show it on the receipt. If the bartender added 20% without informing the customer, that might not be legal, depending on the state. If the tip wasn't disclosed, the user might have a point in not paying it. However, in some places, bartenders are allowed to add tips because they rely on them for income, as their hourly wage might be lower.\n\nThe user was drunk but not too drunk to notice the tip being added. They might have been in a poor state to make a rational decision, but they did notice the bartender's action and decided to respond. However, threatening not to serve is on the bartender's side. The user's decision to remove the tip could be seen as a response to an unfair practice if the tip wasn't disclosed. But the user's approach was to leave 0%, which could be seen as confrontational. Maybe a better approach would be to argue the tip amount but still leave something, but the user went to 0%.\n\nAnother angle: the user paid for drinks for friends, so maybe they were in a position to decide the tip amount. If the bartender added the tip without consent, the user could argue that's unfair. But if the bartender is following the bar's policy, which is to add tips automatically, the user might be in a gray area.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if the tip was added without disclosure, the user isn't wrong to not pay it. However, refusing to tip at all might be seen as harsh. The bartender's response of refusing to serve could be a violation of the law if they can't deny service once a payment is being made, but that's another angle.\n\nSo considering all this, the answer would depend on whether the automatic tip was disclosed. If not, the user might be in the right to not tip. If it was disclosed, then the user is in the wrong. Since the user said the bartender added it without telling, maybe the bartender was wrong, so the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
