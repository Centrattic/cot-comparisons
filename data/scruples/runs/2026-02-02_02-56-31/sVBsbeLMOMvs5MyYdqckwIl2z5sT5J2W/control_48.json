      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to \"4 drinks,\" which I think means they paid for four rounds of drinks for their group. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the person. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They decided to tip 0% as a response, and the bartender refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person argues that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. \n\nFirst, let's consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is customary for service. The bartender added 20% automatically, which might be standard for some places. But the issue here is that the bartender didn't inform the customer about the tip. Normally, the customer can decide the tip amount, unless there's a policy of automatic gratuities for groups. \n\nThe person felt that the bartender was taking advantage of their inebriation by adding the tip without permission. They responded by not tipping at all, which led to the bartender refusing service. The key points here are whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without consent and whether the customer's response was appropriate.\n\nIf the bartender's policy is to add a tip for groups, maybe that's acceptable, but if it's done without informing the customer, that's a problem. The customer might not be aware of that policy when they come in. The person's anger at being unable to control the tip amount is understandable. However, the response of giving 0% could be seen as retaliatory, which might not be the best approach. \n\nBut then again, if the bartender is forcing them to tip without asking, that's also an issue. The customer might feel their autonomy is being violated. The bartender's refusal to serve could be his right, depending on the establishment's policy. But maybe the customer is in the right for standing up against being overcharged, especially if the bartender's actions were deceptive.\n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? It depends on whether the bartender was allowed to add the tip without consent. If the establishment has a clear policy, then the customer might be expected to know that. But if there's no such policy or if it's not communicated, the bartender might be at fault. The customer's anger is justified if they were not informed, but retaliating by not tipping at all could be seen as a counter-action. However, not tipping is also a form of customer choice. \n\nI think the person's main issue is that the bartender added a tip without their knowledge. If the bartender had asked, the customer might have decided to tip or not. The fact that the bartender did it on their own and then refused service when the customer tried to take it back is a bit of a conflict. So the person isn't necessarily in the wrong for not tipping, especially if the bartender's actions were against their usual practice. But maybe the bartender was within their rights if the policy is to add a tip for groups. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I'm leaning towards the person not being in the wrong because the bartender didn't communicate the tip addition, which could be a breach of standard service etiquette. The customer's response was a reaction to that breach, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
