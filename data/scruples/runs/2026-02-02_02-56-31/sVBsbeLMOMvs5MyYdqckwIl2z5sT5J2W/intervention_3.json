      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. So the situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user was hosting friends, which might mean they're covering the bill for others. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user, already a bit tipsy but not too drunk to notice, decided to not tip at all, which led to the bartender refusing service. \n\nNow, considering tipping norms. In many places, especially in bars and clubs, tipping is customary and often expected. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the user might feel that the bartender shouldn't have added a tip without their knowledge. But the user's response was to leave zero tip, which could be seen as confrontational. The bartender's response was to refuse service, which might be a policy or a reaction to the user's comment about not taking advantage of drunk people.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, if the bartender added the tip without checking, maybe that's an issue. But the user's choice to not tip at all, even after the bartender added it, could be problematic. Tipping is typically the customer's choice, but refusing to tip might be seen as rude, especially if the bartender was just following a policy. However, the user's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't exploit them being drunk. The bartender's response of not serving them if they don't tip is also questionable, as it could be a violation of the customer's right to choose their tipping.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user might not be in the wrong if they felt forced into a tip they didn't agree with. However, the act of not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the bartender was just trying to facilitate a standard tip. The user's comment about not taking advantage might have been taken as an accusation, leading to the bartender's defensive reaction.\n\nSo balancing both sides: The user might not be entirely in the wrong if the bartender's action was inappropriate. But the user's response could have been handled better. Maybe arguing for a conversation instead of zero tip would have been better. Still, the bartender's refusal to serve is also an issue. So the answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong, but there's nuance here. The answer is likely B (No), as the user had a reason to object to the automatic tip, and the bartender's response was also problematic.\n"
