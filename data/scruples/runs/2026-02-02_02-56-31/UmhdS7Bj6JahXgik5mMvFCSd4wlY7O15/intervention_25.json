We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 19-year-old girl in a relationship with an 18-year-old boyfriend. They've been together about a month and a half. The key incident here is that during a walk, the boyfriend threw a cup of iced tea at her after she tapped him on the leg. The girl set a boundary that if he didn't get therapy for his anger issues, she would leave. Now she's questioning if she was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend had previously mentioned having anger issues, but the girl didn't see red flags. However, this incident where he lashed out physically, even if it was with a soft object, is a breach of physical safety. The girl is setting a boundary to address his behavior, which is crucial in any healthy relationship. \n\nNext, the girl's response was to give an ultimatum for therapy or leave. This is a firm stance but not unreasonable given the situation. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help. The question is whether the girl is being too pushy. But when someone's safety is involved, setting clear boundaries is necessary. She's not wrong for prioritizing her well-being.\n\nHowever, some might argue that a one-month relationship might not have enough history to enforce such a strict requirement. But the boyfriend himself had mentioned anger issues, so the girl was acting on prior knowledge. Also, the act of throwing a cup, even if not violent, is a form of aggression that can escalate. The girl is proactively addressing a potential problem.\n\nAnother angle is the age factor. Both are teenagers, which can mean emotional volatility. But her response shows maturity by addressing the issue directly rather than ignoring it. It's important to differentiate between typical teenage behavior and concerning actions. The fact that he reacted impulsively and then apologized might indicate he's aware of his actions, which is a positive sign. However, the girl is right to ensure it doesn't happen again through therapy.\n\nIn terms of alternatives, maybe discussing therapy without the ultimatum could be considered, but given the immediate incident, the girl's approach seems justified. She's not giving him a second chance without accountability. The key here is that she's setting a clear boundary for her safety and well-being, which is entirely valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the girl isn't in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her own safety and addressing a known issue that the boyfriend himself acknowledged. Her decision to require professional help is reasonable and proactive.\n"
