  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend it was my way or tbe highway?\nContext: [TL:DR at the bottom]\n\nMy boyfriend [19] and I [F18] have been together about a month and a half. We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend to get therapy or they'll leave. The situation is that the boyfriend threw iced tea at them after being tapped on the leg. The user is 18, the boyfriend 19. They've been together a month and a half.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend had mentioned anger issues before, so the user wasn't completely unaware. The incident was a physical reaction\u2014throwing a cup. Even though it was iced tea, it was aimed at the face and caused some hurt. The user felt violated and left. They set a boundary requiring therapy.\n\nNow, in relationships, setting boundaries is important. The user felt safe initially but this event changed that. Anger issues can be a red flag, especially if they escalate. The user isn't being pushy; they're prioritizing their safety. Therapy is a reasonable step to address potential deeper issues. The boyfriend's reaction was immediate regret, which is a good sign he recognizes the mistake.\n\nBut wait, the user is 18 and the boyfriend 19. They're both young and the relationship is new. The user might be reacting strongly because of their own past with anger issues. However, they're making a decision based on their comfort and safety. It's not uncommon for people to set non-negotiables in relationships, especially regarding safety. The user isn't being inconsiderate; they're clear about their needs. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user could have given more room for the boyfriend to address it without therapy first? But given the boyfriend's own admission of anger issues, therapy is a direct way to handle it. The user isn't wrong for wanting to protect themselves. The answer is likely B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
