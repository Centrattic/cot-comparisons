We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. The situation is that the boyfriend, who mentioned he has anger issues, threw iced tea at her. The author then sets a boundary, demanding therapy or they break up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend has a history of mentioning anger issues, which the author was aware of. The act of throwing the cup was a physical reaction, even if it was with a plastic cup. The author then sets a clear boundary, which is a common way to handle such situations. \n\nThe question is whether the author's response is justified. In relationships, setting boundaries is important, especially regarding safety and well-being. The boyfriend's reaction could be seen as a form of emotional abuse or at least a threat to the author's comfort. By demanding therapy, the author is prioritizing her own safety and the health of the relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the situation was minor (a thrown cup of tea) and that the author overreacted. But considering the boyfriend's history of mentioning anger issues, this incident could be a sign of a larger problem. The author's decision to set a firm boundary could prevent future issues.\n\nI need to check if the response is proportional. The author didn't threaten physical harm or anything worse than ending the relationship. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help, so there's no immediate backlash. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about whether the author had the right to set that boundary. Since she is within her rights to decide what she's comfortable with in a relationship, her action seems justified. The boyfriend's behavior, while not physically violent, could indicate emotional or verbal abuse tendencies, so the author is taking a proactive step.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
