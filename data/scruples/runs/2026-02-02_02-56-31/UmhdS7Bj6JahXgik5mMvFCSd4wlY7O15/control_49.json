We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. The situation is that the boyfriend threw iced tea at her after she tapped him. They're both teenagers, 19 and 18, been together a month and a half. The key points here are about his anger issues and her response.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues before, but the author didn't take it seriously, thinking it was just teenage behavior. Then an incident happens where he reacts impulsively. The author is upset and sets a boundary: therapy or break up. The boyfriend agrees to get help. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a relationship advice perspective, setting boundaries about abusive behavior is generally supported. Hitting someone with a cup, even if it's not physical violence, could be seen as an aggressive act. The author is protecting herself and addressing a red flag. \n\nBut some might argue that she's being too harsh because it's early in the relationship and maybe the incident wasn't that severe. However, emotional and physical safety are important, and pushing for therapy shows she's taking his issues seriously. \n\nAnother angle is that the boyfriend apologized and is willing to get help, which might indicate he's aware of the problem. The author's firm stance could be seen as necessary to prevent future issues. On the other hand, some might say she's overreacting because it was a one-time incident and not a pattern yet. \n\nBut considering the boyfriend's own admission about his anger issues, the incident was a trigger for the author. Setting a clear boundary is a responsible action. In many relationship guidelines, advocating for one's safety and mental health is encouraged. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
