We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user, a girl, is in a relationship with a 19-year-old boyfriend for about a month and a half. He mentioned he has anger issues, but she didn't take it too seriously because she used to be angry too. Then, during a walk, she tapped him on the leg with her foot to make a quip. He turned around and threw his iced tea cup at her face. She left, and he apologized. She told him he needs to get therapy or she's leaving. Now she's wondering if she was too pushy.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The boyfriend had mentioned anger issues before. The user didn't think much of it, assuming it was typical for a teenager. The incident: a playful tap leads to him throwing a cup at her face. That seems like an overreaction. The user left and set a boundary: therapy or breakup. He agreed to get help.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a healthy relationship. In any relationship, especially with someone who's mentioned having anger issues, it's important to address behaviors that make you uncomfortable or unsafe. The act of throwing something, even if it's a plastic cup with iced tea, could be seen as an act of aggression. The user's reaction is to set a clear boundary because she's concerned about his anger management.\n\nBut wait, the boyfriend apologized and said he didn't register the anger first. He might have acted impulsively. The user's response is to require therapy. Is that too harsh? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is healthy. If someone's behavior is making you feel unsafe or disrespected, it's reasonable to ask them to address it. Therapy is a constructive step.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the situation was minor\u2014a month and a half relationship, a teenager's moment of stress. Maybe the user overreacted? But the key here is that the boyfriend had prior warnings about his anger, and the action was an escalation. The user felt hurt and unsafe, leading her to set a boundary. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend's action was inappropriate. Throwing something is a physical act that can cause harm. The user isn't in the wrong for protecting herself and setting limits. It's not about being pushy but about prioritizing her well-being. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her emotional safety and addressing a red flag that was previously mentioned. The answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
