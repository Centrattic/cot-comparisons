We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old girl in a one-and-a-half-month relationship with a 19-year-old boyfriend. They both clicked at the beginning, and he mentioned having anger issues. The author used to be angry herself but didn't mind as long as there were no negative consequences. Now, during a walk, she taps him on the leg with a joke, and he throws his iced tea cup at her face. She's upset, leaves, and tells him he needs therapy or she's leaving. He apologizes and promises to get help.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key elements here. The boyfriend's action of throwing a cup of tea could be seen as a physical reaction to anger. Even though it didn't cause serious harm, the act itself might be a red flag, especially since he had mentioned anger issues before. The author's response is to set a boundary by demanding therapy or leaving. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, communication and setting boundaries are important. If one partner is using violence, even minor, it's reasonable to express concern. However, some might argue that the situation is overreacted if it's a one-time incident and the boyfriend apologized. But others might see the author as justified in protecting herself, especially if there's a history of anger issues.\n\nAlso, considering their age, they're both teenagers, and sometimes emotions can be intense. But that doesn't mean abusive behavior is acceptable. The key point is that the author recognized a pattern (he mentioned anger issues) and took action when it manifested into a harmful act. \n\nThe author's approach was to set a firm boundary, which is a valid way to handle personal safety and respect in a relationship. The boyfriend's reaction (apologizing and agreeing to therapy) suggests he acknowledged his mistake. So, the author's response seems proactive in preventing future issues. \n\nI don't see any signs that the author is wrong here. She's taking responsibility for her own well-being and addressing a concern that was previously mentioned. The alternative could be downplaying the incident, which could lead to more serious issues. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
