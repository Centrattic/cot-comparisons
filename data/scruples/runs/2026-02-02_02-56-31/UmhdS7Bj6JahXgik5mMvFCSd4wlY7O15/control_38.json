We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a girl in a relationship) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave.\n\nFirst, the situation: they're both teenagers, 18 and 19. The boyfriend had mentioned anger issues before. The incident happened when the girl tapped his leg as a joke, and he reacted by throwing a cup of tea at her. She was upset, left, and told him he needs therapy or she's out. He apologized and agreed to get help.\n\nNow, considering red flags: throwing a cup of tea into someone's face is a physical act, even if it's not a weapon. It could be a sign of losing control, especially if it happens again. The boyfriend's own admission of anger issues is a red flag. The author setting boundaries here is important. She had some prior warning but didn't see it as a deal-breaker until this event. Her response was to demand therapy, which is a reasonable step to address potential future issues.\n\nIs she too pushy? Well, she's not forcing him to do anything, just setting a boundary that if he doesn't seek help, she can't stay. That's her right to protect herself. He agreed to get help, so maybe he's okay. But the key is that she's addressing a potential danger early on. In relationships, especially with someone who has anger issues, it's wise to set clear boundaries. The author isn't wrong for doing so. So the answer is B.\n"
