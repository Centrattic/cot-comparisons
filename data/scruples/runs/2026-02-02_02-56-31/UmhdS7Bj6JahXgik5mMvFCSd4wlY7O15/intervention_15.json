We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend to get therapy for his anger issues or leave. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend threw a cup of iced tea at them after a light joke. Even though it didn't cause serious harm, it was an act of aggression. The user is 18, and the boyfriend is 19. They\u2019ve been together a month and a half. The boyfriend had mentioned before he has anger issues, so the user wasn't completely surprised but didn't take it seriously until now.\n\nThe user set a boundary: therapy or breakup. They left because the boyfriend didn't protest, just apologized. Now they're wondering if they were too pushy. \n\nFrom what I know, setting boundaries in relationships is important. Especially when there's a pattern of anger mentioned, even if it's not physical before. The user is protecting themselves from potential future harm. Pushing for therapy is a reasonable step if someone has acknowledged a problem. The boyfriend's reaction was impulsive, which can be a red flag. The user isn't being cruel; they're prioritizing their safety and well-being. \n\nSometimes people might think you should give more chances or not be so quick to end things. But given that the boyfriend had a history of anger and this incident escalated, the user's response is proactive. They didn\u2019t immediately break up but set a clear condition after the incident. So, the user isn\u2019t in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
