We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend to get therapy or else they break up. The situation involves the boyfriend throwing a cup of iced tea at them after a minor provocation. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues before. The user wasn't surprised but thought it was just teenage behavior. When the incident happened, the user felt it was a red flag and set a boundary. \n\nNow, the key points here: the user is 18, the boyfriend is 19. They've been together a month and a half. The user set a clear boundary after an act that made them uncomfortable and unsafe. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help. The user is being strict but is standing up for their own safety and well-being.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is it reasonable to ask for professional help when someone has a history of anger issues? In relationships, communication is key. The user didn't lash out but calmly set a boundary. The boyfriend's action was a reaction to a minor action (tapping leg), which is concerning because it's an overreaction. The user's decision to leave if he doesn't seek help is about protecting themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the user is being too quick to judge or not giving enough time. But given that the boyfriend had already mentioned anger issues, this incident could be a sign of a pattern. The user's action is about self-respect and safety, not just being pushy. \n\nAlso, considering the age of both parties, they might be inexperienced, but that doesn't mean the user is wrong to set boundaries. Therapy is a valid step when dealing with emotional issues. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They are prioritizing their safety and addressing a known issue. The boyfriend's reaction was inappropriate, and the user is taking a responsible step by requiring him to seek help. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
