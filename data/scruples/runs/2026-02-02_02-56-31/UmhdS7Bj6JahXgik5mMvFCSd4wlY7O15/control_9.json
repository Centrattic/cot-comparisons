We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to get therapy or she'll leave after he threw iced tea at her. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 19, the author is 18. They've been dating a month and a half. He mentioned anger issues before, but she didn't see red flags. Then, after a minor provocation (a foot tap), he threw the tea at her. She left and told him he needs therapy or she's gone. \n\nSo, is she wrong? Let's break it down. The key points here are: he had prior mentioned anger issues, the incident wasn't violent but was intentional, and she set a boundary. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, setting boundaries is important. If someone's behavior makes you uncomfortable or unsafe, it's valid to address it. The boyfriend's reaction was an escalation. Throwing something, even iced tea, can be seen as a form of emotional abuse or a sign of poor impulse control. \n\nThe author's response is to require therapy, which is a reasonable step if he's willing to work on it. But if he can't or won't, then she's leaving. That's not pushy; it's self-respect. \n\nSome might argue that she's being too quick to end things, but given that he had prior issues and this was a direct act of aggression, her stance is justified. Also, considering their ages, they're young and might not have much experience, but that doesn't mean her decision is wrong. \n\nPotential counterpoints: Maybe she overreacted to a minor incident? But the boyfriend's action was unprovoked and aggressive. She didn't retaliate physically, just set a firm boundary. \n\nTherapy is a constructive step. His immediate apology and regret are positive, but past behavior can repeat. She's protecting herself by holding him accountable. \n\nI think the author is in the right. The answer should be B.\n"
