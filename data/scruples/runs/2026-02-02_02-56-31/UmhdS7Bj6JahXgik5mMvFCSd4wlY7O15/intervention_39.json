We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend to get therapy or she'll leave. The context is that he threw an iced tea cup at her after she tapped him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The boyfriend admitted to having anger issues before. The user didn't take it seriously at first but now is reacting to the incident. Throwing a cup, even if it's a plastic one, is a physical reaction and could be a sign of something deeper. The user set a boundary, which is that he needs to get help or she'll leave. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she reacted to an act that could be considered violent. He apologized and agreed to get help. She's setting a clear boundary, which is important in a relationship. But some might argue that she's being too harsh because it was an isolated incident. However, given that he had mentioned anger issues before, this might be a pattern.\n\nThe user is 18 and the boyfriend 19, both teenagers. They've been dating a month and a half. Teenagers might act impulsively, but the user is taking responsibility for her safety by setting a boundary. The key here is that she's not staying in a potentially abusive situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, setting boundaries isn't something to be blamed for. If the boyfriend can't handle that, maybe it's his issue. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's protecting herself and addressing a red flag, it's more about self-respect and safety. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
