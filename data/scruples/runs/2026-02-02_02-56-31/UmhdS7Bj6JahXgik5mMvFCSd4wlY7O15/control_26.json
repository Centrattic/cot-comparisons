We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for setting a firm boundary with her boyfriend. The boyfriend had a history of anger issues, which he mentioned before. The incident was him throwing tea on her, which could be seen as aggressive. The author told him he needed therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. If someone's behavior is harmful or makes the other person uncomfortable, it's valid to address it. The boyfriend had warned her about his anger, so maybe she had a reason to be cautious. The action of throwing a cup of tea, even if it's not hot, could be seen as a violent reaction. \n\nBut some might argue that the author was too harsh in her response. Maybe she could have given him another chance or approached it more gently. However, considering the immediate threat and the emotional impact, her decision to prioritize her safety and require professional help seems reasonable. \n\nTherapy is a common recommendation for anger management, so her asking for that isn't unreasonable. The key here is that she's setting a boundary to protect herself, which is a healthy approach. The boyfriend's reaction was unprovoked and hurtful, so her stance to leave if it continues makes sense. \n\nI think the majority of people would side with the author here. She's taking a stand for her well-being, which is important, especially in a new relationship where trust and safety are crucial. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
