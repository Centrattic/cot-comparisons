We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend he needs to get therapy or else she'll leave after he threw iced tea on her. First, I need to consider the context.\n\nThe boyfriend is 19, she's 18, and they've been together a month and a half. He mentioned having anger issues before, which she initially dismissed as typical teenage behavior. Then the incident happened. She tapped him with her foot, he reacted by throwing the tea cup at her, which was painful and messy. She left, and told him it's either therapy or she's gone.\n\nNow, the key points here: He had a history of anger issues, which he had communicated. She felt comfortable, but this incident was a clear example of his anger. She's setting a boundary, which is understandable. The question is whether she's being too pushy.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel safe. If someone's behavior is a red flag, like sudden aggressive outbursts, it's valid to set boundaries. She's not just reacting impulsively; she's addressing a known issue he's already brought up. Saying she'll leave if he doesn't seek help is a firm boundary, which can be necessary if the behavior is harmful.\n\nSome might argue that she's too harsh, but given the situation, she's prioritizing her safety and the relationship's health. Therapy is often a reasonable request for addressing anger issues. The boyfriend's immediate apology and regret suggest he's aware it was wrong, so her demand for change isn't unreasonable.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's setting a boundary for her well-being in response to a known problem. There's no indication she's being overly controlling; she's responding to a specific incident with a clear solution. The alternative would be to risk further incidents, which is not advisable.\n"
