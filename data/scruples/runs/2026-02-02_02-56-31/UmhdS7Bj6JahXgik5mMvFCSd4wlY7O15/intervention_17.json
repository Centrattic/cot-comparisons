We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend he needs to seek therapy or she'll leave. The situation involves an incident where the boyfriend threw a cup of iced tea at her after a playful tap. \n\nFirst, I need to consider their ages. Both are teenagers, 18 and 19. Relationships can be tricky when people are still developing emotionally. The boyfriend mentioned his anger issues before, which the user didn't take seriously at first, thinking it's just part of being a teenager. But this incident escalated when he reacted violently, even if it was with a non-harmful object.\n\nThe user's response was to set a boundary: therapy or leave. That seems like a strong move, but is it justified? Physical aggression, even if it doesn't cause serious harm, can be a red flag. The user was hurt and felt violated, so her reaction is understandable. She's prioritizing her safety and the health of the relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that setting such a strict ultimatum could be seen as too harsh, especially in a new relationship. But given that the boyfriend acknowledged his mistake and is willing to get help, maybe the user is just being proactive. Therapy is a reasonable step for someone with anger management issues.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's immediate regret and apology. That shows he recognizes his actions were wrong, which is a positive sign. The user is giving him a chance to address the problem, which is a mature approach. \n\nBut could there be a better way? Maybe giving him time to seek help without an ultimatum, but the user felt the need to set clear boundaries after this incident. Considering the context\u2014his prior mention of anger issues and the sudden physical reaction\u2014her decision seems justified. \n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong. She's taking her safety seriously and holding her partner accountable, which is necessary in a healthy relationship.\n"
