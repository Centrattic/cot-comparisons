We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a girl in a relationship) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he either gets therapy or she leaves. The context is that the boyfriend had an outburst where he threw iced tea at her after she tapped him playfully. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation, the boyfriend mentioned having anger issues before. The girl didn't take it seriously at first, thinking it was just teenage behavior. But this time, he reacted violently by throwing a cup in her face. She then set a boundary, demanding he get help or she'd leave. \n\nNow, considering what's appropriate in a relationship, setting boundaries around abusive or harmful behavior is crucial. Even if the boyfriend apologized afterward, the act of throwing a drink, while not physically injurious, is a form of aggression and could escalate. The girl's reaction is about self-respect and safety.\n\nThe key points here are that the boyfriend had prior warnings about his anger, the incident was an escalation, and the girl is taking a stand to protect herself. The question is whether her approach is too harsh. Since she's addressing a potential red flag and setting a clear boundary, her action seems justified. She's not being pushy but rather advocating for her own well-being. \n\nPossible counterarguments might suggest giving him more time or that it was a one-time incident. However, considering his previous comments about anger issues, this might not be a one-time event. The girl is proactively ensuring her safety and future in the relationship. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's correctly prioritizing her safety and addressing a serious issue early on.\n"
