We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. The situation is that her boyfriend threw iced tea in her face after she tapped him, and she set a boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend is 19, she's 18. They've been together a month and a half. He mentioned anger issues before, which he says he can get irrationally angry. The author used to have anger issues too but thought this was manageable. Now, after the tea incident, she's setting a firm boundary: therapy or break up.\n\nIs her reaction reasonable? Throwing a cup of tea, even if it's not hot, is a physical aggression. It caused her to get wet, hurt her, and she had to leave. She's setting a clear boundary for her safety and well-being. Given that he admitted he reacted without thinking and apologized, she's not overreacting by wanting him to address this. \n\nThe key points are about setting healthy boundaries. In relationships, it's important to address behaviors that could escalate. Anger issues can lead to more serious problems if not addressed. Her approach is direct but necessary. She's not being pushy; she's prioritizing her safety. \n\nHowever, some might argue she's too harsh given the short time they've been together. But considering his history of mentioning anger and the incident being a clear example, her response is justified. The boyfriend needs to take responsibility, and her holding him accountable isn't wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's taking a stand for her safety and the health of the relationship. It's reasonable to expect a partner with anger issues to seek help.\n"
