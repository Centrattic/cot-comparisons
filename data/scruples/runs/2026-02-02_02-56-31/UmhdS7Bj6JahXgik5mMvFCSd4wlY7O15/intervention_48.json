We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend he needs to get therapy or she'll leave. The situation is that he threw iced tea at her after she lightly tapped him. She's 18, he's 19, and they've been together a month and a half.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend mentioned his anger issues before, but she didn't take it too seriously since she had anger issues too. But this incident escalated. Throwing a cup of tea isn't physical violence, but it's a clear act of aggression. It caused her physical harm (getting iced tea in her face) and emotional distress. She confronted him, and he apologized, saying he reacted without thinking and regretted it.\n\nThe user's main action here is setting a boundary: either he gets therapy, or she leaves. The question is whether this is too pushy. In relationships, setting boundaries around abusive behavior is important. Anger that leads to aggressive acts, even if not physically violent, can be a red flag. Especially when the person acknowledges their anger issues, it's reasonable to address it.\n\nBut she's young, and the relationship is new. Maybe there's a different approach, like suggesting therapy without ultimatums. However, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her safety and well-being. Ultimatums can be harsh, but if the behavior is unacceptable and there's a clear risk, it's a valid way to enforce boundaries.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms around what's acceptable. Throwing something in anger might be seen as a minor incident, but combined with his previous admission of anger issues, it's a sign that his reactions might be problematic. She's taking it seriously, which is good.\n\nSo, balancing between being too strict and acknowledging her right to safety. The answer probably leans towards her not being in the wrong but maybe suggesting a more collaborative approach next time. However, the key here is that she's standing up for herself, which is a positive action. So the answer is B, No.\n"
