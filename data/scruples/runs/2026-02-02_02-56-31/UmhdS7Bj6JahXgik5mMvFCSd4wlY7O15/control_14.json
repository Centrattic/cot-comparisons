We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who had an outburst, threw iced tea at her, and the author told him he needs therapy or she's leaving. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are teenagers, 19 and 18, so they're still young. The boyfriend mentioned he had anger issues before. The author didn't mind because she used to be angry too. But this time, he reacted by throwing a cup at her. That's a physical reaction, even if it was a plastic cup with iced tea. It caused some physical harm, like getting wet and maybe a bit of pain.\n\nThe author's response was to set a firm boundary: therapy or she leaves. She's standing her ground, which is important in a healthy relationship. Setting boundaries is crucial, especially when there's a history of anger issues. The boyfriend apologized and promised to get help, so he wasn't resistant. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, she's protecting herself. If someone's behavior is harmful, even if it's accidental, it's valid to address it. The question is whether her approach was too harsh. She didn't give him another chance without any conditions, which could be seen as being direct. But given the incident and his prior warnings, it's a reasonable step. \n\nSome might argue she should have given more time or tried other methods first. But considering the immediate reaction and the potential for escalation, her decision to require therapy is proactive. It's about safety and well-being. So, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's taking responsibility for her own happiness and safety, which is a healthy approach.\n"
