We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The user is an 18-year-old female in a relationship with a 19-year-old boyfriend. They've been together for a month and a half. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues but didn't seem violent. The author used to have anger issues too but didn't mind. \n\nThe incident happened when they were walking back from dinner. The author tapped his leg with her foot as a joke, and he turned around and threw his iced tea cup at her face. She was upset, left his place, and told him he needed to get therapy for his anger or she was leaving. He apologized and promised to get help.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting that boundary. \n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable in a relationship. Violence, even if not physical, is a serious issue. Throwing a cup of tea, even if it's iced, could be seen as an act of aggression. The author was trying to protect herself by setting a clear boundary that if he can't manage his anger, the relationship can't continue. \n\nBut some might argue that she was too quick to set such a firm boundary without giving him more time or understanding. However, given that he had already mentioned his anger issues, and this incident could have been more serious, her reaction is understandable. Also, she's an 18-year-old dealing with a new relationship, so her approach might be seen as reasonable.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's reaction was impulsive and without communication. He didn't address his anger but reacted violently. The author is taking a stand to protect herself, which is a valid choice. Therapy is a common recommendation for anger management, so her suggestion isn't unreasonable.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is in the right. She's setting healthy boundaries to ensure her safety and the health of the relationship. The boyfriend needs to address his anger, and she's holding him accountable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
