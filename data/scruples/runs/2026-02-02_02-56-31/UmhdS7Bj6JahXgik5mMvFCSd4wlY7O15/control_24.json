We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the girl in the story) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The boyfriend had thrown iced tea on her in a moment of anger. He admitted it was a reaction he didn't control, apologized multiple times, and promised to get help. The girl set a clear boundary: therapy or she leaves. She's 18, he's 19, both teenagers. \n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, setting boundaries is generally healthy. The girl felt safe initially but the incident changed that. She's taking a firm stance because she wants to protect herself from future incidents. But is that too pushy?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guy is young and still learning how to manage emotions. The girl's approach could be seen as reasonable because it's about addressing a potential red flag before it leads to more serious issues. Also, the boy's reaction was immediate and uncontrolled, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she's making a drastic decision without giving him time to improve. But others would say that in a relationship, you can't ignore red flags just because the person is sorry. The key here is that she's prioritizing her safety and well-being, which is important.\n\nTherapy is a common solution for anger management, so suggesting it isn't unreasonable. The girl isn't threatening him but setting a boundary for her own comfort. So, I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. She's handling it maturely by addressing the issue directly.\n"
