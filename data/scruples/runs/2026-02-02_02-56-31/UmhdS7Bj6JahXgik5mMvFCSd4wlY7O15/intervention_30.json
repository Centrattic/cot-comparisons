We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend he needs therapy or they'll break up after he threw iced tea at her. The boyfriend is 19, she's 18, and they've been together a month and a half.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. He mentioned his anger issues before, so she wasn't completely off-base. The incident was a physical reaction\u2014throwing a cup of tea. It wasn't violent in a harmful way, but it did cause discomfort and maybe emotional distress. She asked for therapy as a condition to stay in the relationship. \n\nShe's setting a boundary here. Setting boundaries is usually healthy, especially when there are known issues. Anger management is a valid concern. If someone has a history of anger, it's reasonable to expect them to seek help to prevent future incidents. \n\nHe apologized and agreed to get help, so the immediate response was positive. She's not being aggressive beyond stating her needs. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being firm. \n\nPushiness could be a factor if she's overreacting, but given the context, she's addressing a red flag. She's young, but her reaction is about self-respect and safety. It's reasonable to prioritize her own well-being. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's protecting herself and addressing a known issue he's had. The way she communicated it might be firm, but it's a clear boundary. There's no indication she's being unreasonable here. The boyfriend's action was inappropriate, and she's holding him accountable, which is justified.\n"
