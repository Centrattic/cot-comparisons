We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The couple is young: she's 18, he's 19. They've been together a month and a half. The boyfriend mentioned having anger issues before, which the author didn't take as a big red flag because she used to be angry too. In this incident, after a light joke and a foot tap, he suddenly threw his iced tea cup at her, which was surprising and caused her to leave. She then set a boundary: therapy or breakup.\n\nSo the key points here are: did the author overreact, or was her demand for therapy justified?\n\nFrom the boyfriend's side, he reacted impulsively with physical aggression, even if it was with a harmless object (plastic cup, iced tea). He apologized and said he didn't register the anger at first. But the act of throwing something at someone's face is a clear boundary violation. The author felt hurt and used a firm stance to ensure his behavior changes. \n\nAnger issues leading to physical aggression, even minor ones, can be a sign of deeper problems that might escalate. Therapy is a common and reasonable recommendation in such cases. The author isn't forcing him to go immediately but is setting a condition for their relationship's continuation. That's about self-respect and safety. \n\nThe boyfriend's response was to agree, so there's no resistance mentioned yet. The question is whether the author's approach was too pushy. But given that she's setting boundaries after an incident that clearly upset her, it's about protecting herself. In relationships, especially where there's a history of anger issues, advocating for safety is important. \n\nYoung people might not handle conflict well, but the author is taking responsibility for her choice and prioritizing her well-being. So, the answer would be B (No) because she's not in the wrong; she's asserting her needs after a justified concern.\n"
