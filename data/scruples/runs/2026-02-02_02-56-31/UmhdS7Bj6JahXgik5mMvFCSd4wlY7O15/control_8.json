We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The context is that the boyfriend, who's 19, had anger issues. The author, who's 18, told him he either gets therapy or she's leaving. So, the main question is whether she's being too pushy or if she's justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues before, and the author didn't take it seriously at first, thinking it was just teenage behavior. Then, he threw a cup of iced tea at her, which was a clear aggressive reaction. The author was upset and decided that he needs to seek help for his anger, setting a boundary.\n\nNow, the key points here are the boyfriend's prior disclosure of anger issues and the specific incident that triggered the author's response. The author is setting a boundary to protect herself, which is a common and reasonable approach in relationships. Setting boundaries is not inherently pushy. However, the severity of the response\u2014demanding therapy or leaving\u2014might depend on the context. \n\nBut considering that the boyfriend had warned about his anger and this was a clear example of it manifesting, the author is taking a proactive step to address a potential pattern before it escalates. Therapy is a constructive way to handle anger issues, so asking for that isn't unreasonable. The author isn't being abusive or controlling here; she's expressing her needs and limits.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the situation isn't that serious\u2014throwing an iced tea cup isn't physical violence. But the author felt it was a significant red flag, especially given his prior comments. Her reaction is based on self-respect and safety, which are valid. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the boyfriend's actions are the ones that triggered the situation. The author is responding appropriately by setting a boundary. Therefore, the answer is likely B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her own needs and making a decision based on the red flags that were present.\n"
