We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 19-year-old girl in a one-and-a-half-month relationship with her boyfriend, who is 19. He mentioned he has anger issues. She used to have anger issues too, so she didn't mind. They were just young and enjoying each other. Then, during a walk, she taps his leg as a quip, and he throws his iced tea cup at her face. She gets angry, leaves, and tells him he needs to get therapy or she's leaving. He apologizes, promises to get help, and they talk later. Now she's wondering if she was too pushy.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the boyfriend's action: throwing a cup of tea at her. That's a physical act, even if it's a plastic cup. It caused her hurt and got her angry. The key here is that the boyfriend acted out without provocation (a tap on the leg as a joke), reacted with aggression, and didn't communicate his anger. That's a red flag for emotional or physical abuse, even if it's not violent in the traditional sense.\n\nThe author responded by setting a boundary: therapy or she leaves. She's taking a firm stance because she's aware of his history with anger issues. She's not being manipulative; she's prioritizing her safety and well-being. He apologized and agreed to get help. \n\nNow, did she overreact? Maybe some would say she's too quick to end the relationship. But given that he had previously mentioned anger issues, and this incident showed a pattern, her response is reasonable. She's holding him accountable, which is important in a healthy relationship. Pushing for therapy is a constructive step. \n\nOthers might argue that the boyfriend's action was a one-time thing and that she's being harsh. But considering he didn't communicate his anger and acted impulsively, it's a sign he might not be able to manage his emotions, which can escalate. The author is protecting herself by not tolerating such behavior. \n\nAlso, in relationships, it's important to address red flags early. The fact that he didn't register the anger at first but reacted immediately is concerning. The author is making a clear boundary, which is healthy. She's not wrong for doing that. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's taking a stand for her safety and the relationship's health, which is a responsible action.\n"
