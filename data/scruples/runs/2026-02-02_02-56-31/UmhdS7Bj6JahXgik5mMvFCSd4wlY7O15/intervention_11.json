We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend to get therapy or face a breakup after he threw a cup of tea at them. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 19 and the user is 18. They've been together a month and a half. The boyfriend mentioned his anger issues before, so the user didn't think much of it. But then he threw the tea cup, which was a clear action. The user left and set a boundary that he needs to get help or they're over.\n\nThe key points here are about setting boundaries in a relationship. The user had prior knowledge of the boyfriend's anger issues. When the boyfriend acted out physically, even with a non-harmful object, the user took a stand. Setting boundaries is important, especially when there's a history of the issue being mentioned. The user isn't being unreasonable by wanting the boyfriend to address his anger, especially after an incident that caused harm, even if minor.\n\nThe boyfriend apologized and promised to get help. The user is firm but not giving an ultimatum without cause. In relationships, it's healthy to address harmful behaviors. Since the boyfriend had already indicated he had anger issues, the user's response is proactive. Being in a relationship doesn't mean tolerating harmful actions. The user is prioritizing their safety and well-being, which is valid.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the user is not in the wrong). They're taking responsibility for their safety and making a necessary boundary. There's no indication they overreacted given the context of prior warnings and the incident's impact.\n"
