  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend it was my way or tbe highway?\nContext: [TL:DR at the bottom]\n\nMy boyfriend [19] and I [F18] have been together about a month and a half. We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend he has to get therapy for anger issues or else she's leaving. They're 18, he's 19. They've been together a month and a half. He had thrown iced tea on her after she tapped him with her foot. He apologized, but she set a boundary. Now she's questioning if she's being too pushy.\n\nFirst, consider the situation. The boyfriend mentioned his anger issues before, so she was aware. The incident was a physical reaction\u2014throwing a cup, even if it was iced tea. The user left, he came after her, apologized. She set a condition: therapy or break up. He agreed. The user is worried if that was too harsh.\n\nIn relationships, especially young ones, setting boundaries is important. Abuse can be a big red flag. Even if it wasn't physical abuse, the act of throwing a cup could be seen as aggression. The user is protecting herself. Therapy is a reasonable step for someone with anger issues. She's not forcing him into therapy, just requiring him to seek help. She's being clear about her limits, which is important for her safety and well-being.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she was too quick to set a strict ultimatum? But given the situation and prior warnings, it's reasonable. Also, he had already shown regret and apologized. But the user is within her rights to decide what she can tolerate. If he can't manage his anger, it's a serious issue. She's not being pushy; she's setting necessary boundaries. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
