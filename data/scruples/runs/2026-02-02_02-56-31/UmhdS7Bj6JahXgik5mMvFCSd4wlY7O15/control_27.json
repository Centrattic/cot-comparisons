We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a boyfriend who threw iced tea at her because she tapped him, and she told him to get therapy or she'd leave. The options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend had previously mentioned anger issues, but the author didn't take it seriously until the incident. She set a boundary by demanding therapy or the end of the relationship. The question is about whether that's justified.\n\nFrom a personal boundaries standpoint, the author has every right to set limits. The act of throwing a cup of tea, even if it's iced, is a form of physical aggression, even if not severely harmful. The key here is that the author noticed a red flag and is taking action to protect herself. In relationships, it's important to address behavior that makes you uncomfortable or unsafe.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author's response is harsh. She's ending the relationship over a single incident. But considering the boyfriend's own admission about anger issues, this might be a pattern. The author isn't just reacting to this one event but addressing a known issue he's had. Also, she gave him a chance to change by offering therapy as an option before leaving, which shows she's trying to resolve the issue constructively.\n\nAnother angle: teenagers might act impulsively, but the author is acknowledging the seriousness of anger issues. Therapy is a reasonable step to address potential problems. The boyfriend's immediate regret suggests he understands it was wrong, but the author is ensuring he takes responsibility.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is protecting herself from potential future harm. She's not in the wrong for setting a boundary. The boyfriend's actions, even if impulsive, are a form of violence, and it's valid for her to require accountability. So the answer should be B (No, author is not in the wrong).\n"
