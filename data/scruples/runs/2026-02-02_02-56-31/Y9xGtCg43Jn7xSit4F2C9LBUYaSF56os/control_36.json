Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she's not a good cook, hates cooking, and is financially struggling right now. She can only afford basics like bread, milk, and pasta. Her boyfriend, who is not in financial trouble, cooks a meat stew for himself. She asks if she can have a portion, but he says no. Later, he offers her the leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. She eats them, then he makes her clean up the dishes. She snaps at him, saying he wasn't being kind and that he's acting like an idiot. He yells at her for being ungrateful and says he won't cook for her again. She's upset because she feels like he's treating her like a dog or a roommate, not a partner.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial inequality in the relationship, unequal treatment, and the boyfriend's behavior. The boyfriend has the means to cook for both of them but chooses not to, then gives her leftovers. Then he expects her to clean up without considering her feelings or the situation. The author's financial situation is a big factor here; she can't afford to cook much, so relying on him for meals makes sense. But he's not sharing equally. His reaction to her snapping back is aggressive, pushing her, and calling her names. That's a red flag for abusive behavior. \n\nThe author's response is understandable given the circumstances. She's in a position where she can't cook due to financial constraints and she's asked for a meal. Being given leftovers and then being forced to clean up after him is unfair. The boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to share, giving minimal food, and then physically restraining her\u2014show a lack of consideration and respect. The author is asserting her rights in a relationship where she's been treated poorly. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should share responsibilities and show mutual respect. The boyfriend's behavior here is controlling and unkind. The author's frustration leading to her outburst seems justified given the ongoing treatment. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
