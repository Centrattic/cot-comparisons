Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a relationship where the author is dealing with financial difficulties, can't cook well, and is struggling to afford groceries. Her boyfriend cooks a meat stew for himself, gives her leftovers, and then expects her to clean up, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author is in a tough financial situation, which is affecting her ability to buy food. She asked her boyfriend to prepare a meal for her when he was cooking, but he refused. Then he gave her leftovers, which were minimal, and expected her to do the dishes. The author felt disrespected and pushed back, leading to him calling her names.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for expressing her frustration. Let's break it down. The boyfriend cooked for himself and gave her leftovers, but didn't make a full meal for her. The author points out that he didn't cook for her, just gave her his scraps. She felt unappreciated and treated like a servant. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other. If the boyfriend is in a better financial position, it's reasonable to expect some support, like cooking meals when possible. However, the author asked him to include her in his cooking, and he didn't. Then, after giving her a very small portion, he expected her to clean up without any gratitude. That seems unfair.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive\u2014pushing her, restraining, yelling. That's a red flag for abuse. The author's frustration leading to her snapping was a response to being mistreated. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself, especially when he was abusive. The boyfriend's behavior is more problematic here. The author is highlighting the imbalance in their relationship and the lack of respect. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions were disrespectful and abusive, and the author was justified in expressing her feelings. The key points are his refusal to include her in his cooking, giving her minimal leftovers, expecting her to clean up, and then being abusive when she pushed back. The author's response was a reaction to being treated poorly, not the cause of the problem.\n"
