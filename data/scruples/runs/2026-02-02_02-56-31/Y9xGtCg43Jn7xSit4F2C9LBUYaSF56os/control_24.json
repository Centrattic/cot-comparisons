Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who cooked for himself and then gave the leftovers to his girlfriend, who then snapped at him. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is struggling financially and can't cook often. She asked for a portion of his stew, but he said no. Then he offered her the leftovers after eating most of it. She took it, but later when he asked her to do the dishes, she snapped. She told him that his act wasn't kind and that he treated her like a dog. He got angry and called her names.\n\nThe main points here are the boyfriend's actions. He cooked for himself and gave her leftovers, which she felt was insufficient. The girlfriend's reaction was to tell him she was tired of being treated poorly. The question is whether she was wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The boyfriend might feel he did something kind by sharing his meal. However, the girlfriend is in a financial situation where she can't cook much, and he's not contributing to shared meals. She asked for a portion when he was cooking, and he refused. Then, giving her leftovers isn't the same as cooking for both. The girlfriend's frustration is about being treated as an afterthought, not a partner. Her snapping was a reaction to ongoing issues, not just that one incident. The boyfriend's response\u2014pushing her and calling her names\u2014shows a lack of respect and possible abuse. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should contribute and communicate. The boyfriend's refusal to cook for her and his physical aggression are problematic. The girlfriend had a right to express her frustration, especially when his actions were dismissive. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself in that situation.\n"
