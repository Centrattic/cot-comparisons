Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a boyfriend who cooked a stew for himself and gave her leftovers, then got angry when she said she didn't need to clean up because he didn't cook for her. The author felt he was being unfair, treating her like a dog.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author can't cook and is poor, so she relies on her boyfriend to cook. He cooked for himself and gave her leftovers, but she had to eat that because she didn't have proper food. Then he expected her to clean up, which she refused, leading to an argument.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: cooking for himself, giving her leftovers, then expecting her to clean up. The author's response was to argue that he didn't actually cook for her, just gave her leftovers, so she's not obligated to clean. He then called her names and threatened not to cook again.\n\nNow, considering emotional and physical abuse. The boyfriend pushed and restrained her, which is physical abuse. That's a red flag. The author's outburst was after being physically assaulted. He called her an ungrateful bitch and said he wouldn't cook for her again, which is emotional abuse.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend is in the wrong for using physical force and controlling behavior. The author's reaction, while maybe not the best in terms of communication, was a response to abuse. She's also in a vulnerable financial situation, which adds to the power imbalance. \n\nThe key here is the physical abuse. Even if the author's words were harsh, the boyfriend initiated the violence. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself after being abused. The core issue is the boyfriend's behavior, not the author's response. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
