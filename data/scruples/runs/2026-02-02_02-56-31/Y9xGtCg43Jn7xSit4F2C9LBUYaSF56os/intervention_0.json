  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they're tired of him treating them like a dog. The situation involves financial struggles, unequal sharing of meals, and physical confrontation.\n\nFirst, the user can't afford meat and buys only basics. The boyfriend cooks for himself, gives her leftovers, which she eats because she didn't eat all day. Then he expects her to do the dishes, even though she wasn't involved in cooking. He pushes her, and she snaps back. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and fairness. The boyfriend cooking for himself and giving leftovers might not be generous if he's not sharing properly. Also, expecting her to clean up without her cooking seems unfair. The physical pushing is a red flag\u2014it's wrong to use force. The user's reaction is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nBut the user also admitted they didn't cook themselves, so maybe they could have communicated better about their needs. However, the boyfriend's behavior\u2014being ungenerous, using force, and calling her names\u2014definitely crosses boundaries. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves, especially after being mistreated. The boyfriend's actions are more to blame here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
