Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is between the author and her boyfriend. The key points here are about their financial situations, the cooking incident, and the physical altercation.\n\nFirst, the author is struggling financially, can't afford much food, and isn't a good cook. She asked her boyfriend to make a portion for her when he was cooking a stew. He said no, even though he had enough ingredients. Later, he gave her the leftovers, which were minimal. Then he made her clean up, pushed her, and called her names. She lashed out, saying he wasn't being kind and called him out for his behavior. He responded angrily.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about respect, fairness, and mutual support in a relationship. The boyfriend is in a better financial position but didn't contribute to cooking a meal for both of them. Instead, he gave her leftovers. Then he physically pushed her and expected her to clean up, which escalated the situation. The author, feeling disrespected and taken advantage of, stood up for herself, which led to an argument.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the boyfriend's actions seem problematic. He should have been more considerate, especially given her financial constraints. Cooking for both would have been a reasonable action. Instead, he gave her leftovers and then physically acted out when she refused to clean for him. Physical restraint and pushing is abusive, regardless of the situation. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh in words, was in response to his aggression and controlling behavior. She was standing up for herself against what she perceived as being treated unfairly.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether her actions (yelling and confronting him) were justified. Given that he used physical aggression and called her names, her emotional response is understandable. She's defending her dignity in a relationship where she feels exploited. So, the boyfriend's actions are definitely in the wrong, and the author's reaction is a response to his misconduct. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
