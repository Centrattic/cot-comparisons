Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of him treating her like a dog.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a 5-year relationship. She's struggling financially, can't afford meat except once every two weeks. She's studying and doesn't cook well. The boyfriend cooks a stew for himself, gives her the leftovers (which is barely enough), and then expects her to clean up. When she refuses, he pushes her, gets angry, and calls her names. She snaps back, saying he's not being kind, and he retaliates.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial struggles, unequal treatment in chores, and physical aggression. The boyfriend is in a better financial position but didn't make a meal for both, just for himself. Then he acts like she should be grateful for the scraps and expects her to do the dishes. When she resists, he uses physical force and verbal abuse.\n\nThe author's outburst is about feeling treated like a servant or a dog. She's not wrong to feel that way, especially since he's physically aggressive. Even if she's the one who asked for leftovers, his behavior is controlling and abusive. The fact that he pushed her is a major red flag. Physical aggression is never acceptable, regardless of the situation. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to make a proper meal for her, giving her leftovers, then expecting her to clean up\u2014show a lack of respect. The author's reaction is a stand up for self-respect. She's not in the wrong for calling out his behavior, especially after being mistreated. The main issue here is his abusive behavior, not her standing up for herself.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions are the problem here, including physical aggression and treating her as lesser. The author's frustration is justified given the circumstances.\n"
