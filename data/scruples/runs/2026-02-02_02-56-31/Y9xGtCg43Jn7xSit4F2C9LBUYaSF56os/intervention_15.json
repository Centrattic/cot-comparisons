Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they're tired of being treated like a dog. Let's start by understanding the key points.\n\nFirst, the user is in a tough financial situation, buying only basic groceries because of medical expenses. They mention being a terrible cook and not enjoying cooking. The boyfriend, who's not struggling financially, cooks a meaty stew for himself but initially refuses to make a portion for the user. Later, he offers the leftovers after eating most of it. The user eats the leftovers, which are minimal, and then gets asked to clean the dishes. This leads to an argument where the boyfriend becomes physically aggressive, pushing and restraining the user. The user then snaps, calling him out for not being generous and treating them poorly. The boyfriend yells and threatens not to cook again.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the boyfriend's initial refusal to share the meal, the minimal leftovers given, the physical aggression when demanding chores, and the verbal abuse. The user's frustration is about being treated unfairly, like a servant or a dog, rather than a partner.\n\nThe user's actions: They asked for a portion when he was cooking, which is reasonable. When he refused, they didn't push further but later took the leftovers. Then, when asked to clean dishes, they expressed their feelings, which led to the argument. The boyfriend's behavior includes physical aggression and verbal insults, which are clear red flags in a relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's outburst was in response to being treated poorly. They were in a vulnerable position financially and physically. The boyfriend's actions (refusing to share, giving minimal leftovers, physical aggression) are more concerning. The user's frustration is justified given the circumstances. However, the way they expressed it\u2014calling him out in the moment\u2014might be seen as reactive, but considering the context, it's understandable.\n\nThe key factors are the boyfriend's control and abuse versus the user's legitimate needs. The user isn't at fault for standing up for themselves when being mistreated. The answer should be B (not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's actions are the main issue here.\n"
