  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they're tired of him treating them like a dog. The situation involves financial struggles, unequal sharing of chores, and a conflict over cooking and cleaning.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cooks a stew for himself, gives her leftovers, and then expects her to clean up. The user points out that he only gave her a small portion and then demanded she do the dishes. The user's frustration comes from feeling unappreciated and treated unfairly, especially given their financial situation and the imbalance in responsibilities.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and fairness. The boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking for himself, giving minimal leftovers, then expecting her to clean\u2014could be seen as taking advantage, especially since he's not facing financial issues. The user's outburst was a reaction to feeling disrespected and overburdened. While physical restraint is definitely wrong, the user's verbal response was a reaction to that aggression. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior (pushing, restraining) is a red flag, indicating potential emotional or physical abuse. The user's frustration is valid given the circumstances. So, the answer leans towards the user not being in the wrong because the boyfriend's actions were disrespectful and controlling.\n"
