Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who cooked a stew for himself and gave the leftovers to his girlfriend. She's in a tough financial situation, can't cook well, and asked him for a portion. He cooked for himself, gave her leftovers, then made her clean up. She snapped because she felt treated poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend isn't in financial trouble, so he has the means to buy groceries. The girlfriend is struggling with medical expenses and can only afford basic groceries. She asked for a portion when he was cooking, but he refused. Then he gave her leftovers after eating most of it. She ended up with just a few spoonfuls. That's not a full meal, just a snack.\n\nHe then demands she cleans the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. She resists, leading to a confrontation. She tells him off, and he calls her names. The key points here are about fairness, respect, and reciprocity in a relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: cooking for himself, not including her, giving her leftovers, and then expecting her to do the dishes. This seems like a power imbalance. He's in a position where he can afford to cook but doesn't do the full meal for both, which the author deserves. Also, the physical restraint he used when cornering her is a red flag. That's not acceptable behavior.\n\nThe author's reaction: she's frustrated because she's already in a vulnerable position financially and emotionally. Her outburst is a response to being treated unkindly and disrespectfully. She's not wrong for expressing her feelings when she feels disrespected. The boyfriend's reaction (calling her names) is worse.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself. The boyfriend is the one acting abusively by refusing to share his meal, expecting her to clean up, and using physical force. The author's anger stems from being treated poorly, not from her initial request. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
