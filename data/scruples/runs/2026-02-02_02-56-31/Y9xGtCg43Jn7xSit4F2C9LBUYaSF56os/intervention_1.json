  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after snapping at their boyfriend over cooking and cleaning. First, I need to parse the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the user is in a financial struggle, can't afford to cook much, and relies on their boyfriend's cooking. Tonight, the boyfriend made a stew for himself, but when asked, he didn't make a portion for her. Later, he gave her leftovers, which were minimal. Then he made her clean the dishes, which led to a confrontation. She snapped, and he called her names.\n\nThe main points here are about fairness in the relationship. The boyfriend is in a better financial position, yet she's expected to eat his leftovers and do the dishes. She's not a cook, and her needs aren't being met. The boyfriend's actions seem more like chores being assigned without consideration for her situation.\n\nThe user's outburst was in response to being treated unfairly. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014pushing, restraining, and calling her names\u2014is abusive. Even if the user's reaction was harsh, the underlying issue is about mutual respect and support in a relationship. The boyfriend's actions don't seem kind; he's not sharing the meal equally but instead giving leftovers and expecting her to clean up.\n\nFinancial struggles are a common stressor, but the boyfriend's lack of support and the physical aggression cross a line. The user is not in the wrong for standing up for herself, especially given the boyfriend's abusive behavior. The key here is that in a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other without expecting one to do all the work or endure mistreatment.\n"
