Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong after telling their boyfriend they're tired of him treating her like a dog. \n\nFirst, looking at the context: the user is struggling financially and can't afford proper meals, only basic groceries. Her boyfriend makes a stew for himself, gives her leftovers which are barely a snack, and then expects her to do the dishes. She feels he's not being generous or fair, especially since he's in a better financial position. She snaps at him because she's frustrated with his behavior, and he responds with anger and insults.\n\nSo, the main points here are about fairness, respect, and mutual effort in a relationship. The boyfriend is in a better financial position but is giving her leftovers after she asks for a portion. Then, he tries to make her do the dishes after she's already cleaned them earlier. He uses physical force to restrain her, which is a red flag. The user reacts out of frustration, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should consider each other's needs and limitations. The boyfriend's actions seem to disregard her financial struggles and her basic need for proper meals. Expecting her to cook despite her inability to afford ingredients is unreasonable. His response of using force and calling her names is abusive and wrong. \n\nThe user's outburst might be harsh, but it's a reaction to being mistreated. She's not in the wrong for expressing her frustration when her needs aren't being met. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning because of the physical aggression and lack of support. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions are more problematic, and the user has valid reasons for her reaction.\n"
