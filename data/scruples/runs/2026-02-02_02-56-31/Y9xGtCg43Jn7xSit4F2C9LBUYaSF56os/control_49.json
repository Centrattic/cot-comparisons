  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between them and their boyfriend. The main issues seem to be about cooking, financial struggles, and the boyfriend's behavior.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they can't afford meat often and are struggling financially. They asked the boyfriend to cook a portion for them when he was making stew. He said no, even though there was enough for two. Later, he gave them the leftovers, which were barely two spoonfuls. Then, after the author ate that, the boyfriend made them clean the dishes, even though it was his cooking. The author got angry and snapped, telling him he didn't actually cook for them, just gave leftovers. The boyfriend then called them an ungrateful bitch.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for expressing their frustration. Let's break it down. The boyfriend had the means to buy groceries but chose to cook for himself. The author, in a tough financial situation, relied on him for a meal. When he didn't cook for them, but gave leftovers, it's understandable the author felt used. Then being forced to clean up despite not cooking themselves adds to the tension.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Calling someone an ungrateful bitch is abusive and disrespectful. The author's frustration comes from feeling taken advantage of, especially since they're in a 5-year relationship. The author's outburst, while maybe harsh in delivery, stems from valid feelings of being mistreated. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014pushing, restraining, and belittling\u2014is problematic. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoings, the boyfriend's actions (physical aggression, verbal abuse, expecting the author to clean up when they didn't cook) are clearly in the wrong. The author's response, while perhaps not the most constructive, is a reaction to being mistreated. They're not in the wrong for standing up for themselves after being pushed and disrespected. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
