  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation described. The girlfriend is in a tough spot financially, can't afford much, and is studying. The boyfriend cooks a stew for himself but gives her leftovers, which are barely enough. Then he forces her to clean up after making her eat the leftovers. The author snaps because she's hungry and feels unappreciated, calling him out for not being kind. The boyfriend reacts angrily, calling her a b*tch.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, mutual respect and kindness are key. The boyfriend's actions seem to lack consideration. He cooked for himself but gave her the leftovers, which isn't a generous act. Then he physically restrained her and got angry when she tried to stand up for herself. That's a red flag for abusive behavior. \n\nThe author's response was to express her frustration, which is understandable given the circumstances. She's in a vulnerable position financially and is being treated poorly. Her snapping back in self-defense doesn't make her wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here\u2014using physical force and emotional manipulation. \n\nFinancial hardship can add stress, but that doesn't justify mistreatment. The boyfriend's refusal to cook for her despite having the means is selfish. The author's outburst was a reaction to being disrespected and physically harmed. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions are the main problem here. The author had every right to voice her frustration in this situation.\n"
