  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their boyfriend not sharing the meal he made and then getting angry when she refused to clean up afterward. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user can't afford to buy meat often, and they're on a tight budget. The boyfriend cooks a meat stew for himself, and when asked to make a portion for her, he says no. Then he offers the leftovers, which are barely a snack. She eats it because she's hungry, but later he demands she clean the dishes. She resists, leading to a confrontation where he pushes her and calls her names.\n\nNow, looking at the dynamics here. The boyfriend has the financial means, while the user is struggling. He cooked for himself, not for her. When she asked for a portion, he refused, then gave her leftovers. That doesn't seem generous. Then, he expects her to clean up for his cooking, even though he didn't make a meal for her. The user's reaction is that he's treating her like a servant or pet, which she's not okay with.\n\nHe physically restrained her and used abusive language. That's a red flag. Physical aggression is never acceptable in a relationship. Even if there's a disagreement, pushing someone is wrong. Her snapping back was a reaction to his abuse. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself, especially when he was being abusive.\n\nThe user's main complaint is about being treated unkindly and expecting her to do his dishes without providing proper meals. She's his girlfriend, not a servant. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic\u2014he didn't share his meal, gave minimal leftovers, then forced her to clean up. Her standing up to him was justified given the circumstances. Also, the fact that he called her an ungrateful bitch and said he wouldn't cook for her again shows his lack of consideration and respect.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend is at fault for the physical abuse and poor treatment. The user had no obligation to clean up after him, especially since he didn't cook for her. Her response was a reaction to his abuse, which is understandable. So, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
