Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in her situation with her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is poor, can't afford to cook much, and asked her boyfriend to make her a portion of his stew. He refused, then gave her leftovers. She ate them but then had to deal with him pushing her and making her clean the dishes. She snapped and told him off, leading to an argument where he called her ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness, respect, and mutual responsibility in a relationship. The boyfriend isn't in financial trouble but is cooking for himself and not sharing. The author is in a vulnerable position, can't cook much, and is expected to clean up. When she stands up for herself, he reacts angrily with name-calling.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions seem controlling and disrespectful. He's not contributing financially to meals (since he's not in financial trouble), and he's making her feel like a servant. The author's anger is a reaction to being treated poorly, especially when she's in a tough spot. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. She asked for a meal, which is reasonable. He refused and then gave her leftovers, which is not really generous. Then he tried to make her clean up, which is his own mess. Her frustration leading to her outburst is understandable given the context. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No). She's not in the wrong because the boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. She's standing up for herself against unfair treatment.\n"
