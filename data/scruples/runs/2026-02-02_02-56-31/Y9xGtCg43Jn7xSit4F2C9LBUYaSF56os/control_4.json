Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She mentions she's a terrible cook and can't afford meat because of medical expenses. Right now, her only groceries are bread, milk, and pasta. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meaty stew. She asks for a portion, but he says no. Later, he offers her the leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. She eats it because she hasn't had a proper meal. Then when she tries to put the dish in the sink, he corners her, demands she clean up, and gets physical. She snaps back, explains that his gesture wasn't kind because he only gave her leftovers, and he yells at her, calling her ungrateful and saying he'll never cook for her again.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's analyze both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: She's in a financial hardship, can't cook, and the boyfriend is in a better position. She asked for a portion when he was cooking, which is reasonable. He didn't make enough for her, only gave leftovers, and then expected her to clean up. His behavior seems controlling and possibly abusive. The author's reaction was to stand up for herself after being pushed and restrained. She's pointing out the lack of kindness and the unequal treatment, which seems justified given the circumstances.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective: He might feel that since he cooked, even if it was only leftovers, she should be grateful. However, the way he reacted\u2014pushing, restraining, and yelling\u2014is clearly abusive. His expectation that she should clean up after him, especially when he was the one who cooked, is unfair. Also, the fact that he refused to make her a proper portion when he had enough ingredients suggests a lack of generosity and consideration.\n\nThe key here is the boyfriend's actions: using physical force, making threats, and being disrespectful. Those are red flags for abuse. The author's outburst was a response to that. She's also highlighting the inequality in the relationship, where he's not considering her financial struggles or her inability to cook. The boyfriend's behavior is in the wrong, so the author isn't in the wrong for speaking up. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
