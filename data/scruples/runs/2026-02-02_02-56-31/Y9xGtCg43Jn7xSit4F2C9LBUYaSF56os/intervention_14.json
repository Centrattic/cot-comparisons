  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after a situation with their boyfriend. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user is struggling financially, can't afford meat, and is relying on the boyfriend to make a meal. They asked for a portion when he was making stew, but he said no. Then, after eating, he offered the leftovers, which were minimal. The user took them and later had to clean the dishes, leading to an argument and physical aggression from the boyfriend.\n\nThe user is upset because they feel treated like a dog or a roommate, not a partner. They\u2019re frustrated with the boyfriend's lack of generosity and the unequal treatment. The key points here are financial hardship, unequal contribution in the relationship, and the boyfriend's physical aggression and controlling behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: He cooked for himself, gave leftovers, and then expected the user to clean up, even though he was the one who cooked. The user resisted, leading to a physical confrontation where he called her names. This is a problem because he's showing abusive behavior\u2014physical intimidation and emotional abuse through insults.\n\nThe user's response was to stand up for themselves, which is valid. They're not wrong in feeling mistreated. Financial issues shouldn't justify mistreatment. The boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to share the meal, giving leftovers, then demanding dish duty\u2014show a lack of consideration and empathy. The user's anger is justified given the circumstances.\n\nPhysical aggression is a major red flag. Even if there were misunderstandings, the use of force to make her clean the dishes is inexcusable. The user is not wrong for defending themselves and expressing frustration in a situation where they're being mistreated.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the user is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the user has valid reasons to be upset.\n"
