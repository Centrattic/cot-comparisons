  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after a situation with their boyfriend. They mentioned they're a terrible cook and can't afford meat, so they rely on him for meals. Tonight, he cooked a stew for himself and gave her leftovers, which were barely enough. She asked for a portion when he was cooking, and he said no. Later, he told her to clean up, cornered her, pushed her, and called her an ungrateful bitch. She snapped back, saying he didn't cook for her and that he's acting like she's his dog or roommate.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's actions are problematic. He physically restrained her, which is abuse. That's a red flag. He also gave her leftovers instead of making a proper meal for her when she asked. She's in a difficult financial situation, and he's not in financial trouble. He should have been more considerate. \n\nShe responded by standing up for herself, which is understandable given the abuse. She didn't agree with his behavior and expressed her frustration. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her a name and threatening not to cook again is toxic. \n\nThe key points here are the physical abuse and the lack of support from the boyfriend despite her financial struggles. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself, especially after being pushed. The boyfriend is the one in the wrong for his actions. So, answer B.\n"
