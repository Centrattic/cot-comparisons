Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they're tired of him treating them like a dog. Let me walk through the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the user mentions they're poor due to medical expenses and can only afford basic groceries. They hate cooking and aren't good at it. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meaty stew once every two weeks. The user asks if he can make a portion for her, but he says no. Later, he eats his stew and offers her the leftovers, which are just a couple of spoonfuls. She eats it, then puts the dish in the sink. He then corners her, insists she clean the dishes, and gets aggressive, pushing her. She snaps back, and he calls her names.\n\nSo, the user is upset because the boyfriend didn't cook for her, gave her leftovers, and then made her clean up after him, treating her like a servant or a dog. They're asking if they're in the wrong for expressing frustration about being treated poorly.\n\nFirst, let's consider the boyfriend's actions. He had the means to cook for both, but only cooked for himself. When asked, he refused to make a portion for her. Then, after eating, he gave her the leftovers, which were barely enough. Then, he expects her to clean up, even though she had no part in cooking this time. His aggression and controlling behavior (pushing her) is a red flag. Emotional abuse and physical restraint are serious issues.\n\nThe user's response was to confront him about his lack of kindness and the unfair treatment. She points out the truth that he didn't actually cook for her, just gave her scraps, and that his actions were not generous. His reaction was to escalate the conflict with anger and insults.\n\nIn a relationship, mutual respect and consideration are key. The boyfriend's behavior shows entitlement and lack of empathy. He's using his resources (money for meat) without sharing the benefits, and expecting her to do chores without fairness. The user's frustration is justified because she's in a difficult financial situation and is being treated poorly. She's expressing her feelings, which is healthy, and the boyfriend's response is abusive.\n\nPhysical pushing and restraining are forms of abuse regardless of the situation. The fact that he called her names and threatened to stop cooking for her further indicates his controlling nature. The user is not at fault here for pointing out the unfair treatment. She has every right to be upset about being treated in such a disrespectful manner.\n\nSo, considering all points, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions are the issue here, not hers.\n"
