Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the boyfriend is cooking for himself but gives the author leftovers, leading to a conflict when she's asked to do the dishes.\n\nFirst, the author mentions being poor and struggling to buy groceries. She can't afford meat often, so when her boyfriend cooks a stew, she asks for a portion. He refuses but later gives her leftovers. She eats them because she's hungry. Then he tells her to clean the dishes, and she gets angry because she feels he's treating her like a dog. She confronts him, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and mutual respect in the relationship. The author is in a financial hardship, which affects her ability to contribute to meals. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks for himself and gives her leftovers, but expects her to do the dishes. The author's frustration stems from feeling unappreciated and treated as if she's obligated to serve him without reciprocation.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should share responsibilities and consider each other's circumstances. The boyfriend's refusal to cook for both, despite having the resources, and then expecting her to clean up without acknowledgment of her situation, could be seen as imbalance. The author's outburst was a reaction to accumulated frustration, not just about the dishes but about the overall dynamic of their relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014pushing her and calling her names\u2014are inappropriate and abusive. The author's response, while perhaps harsh, is a valid expression of her feelings of being undervalued. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself, especially in a 5-year relationship where expectations of mutual respect should be higher.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is more problematic, and her response is justified given the circumstances.\n"
