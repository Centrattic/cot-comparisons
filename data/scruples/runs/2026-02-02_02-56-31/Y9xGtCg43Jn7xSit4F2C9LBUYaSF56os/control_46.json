  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cooks a stew for himself and has leftovers. The author didn't eat much that day and asks for a portion, but he says no. Then, after eating, he offers the leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. She eats them, and then he makes her clean the dishes. She snaps back, leading to an argument where he calls her names.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and fairness. The boyfriend is in a better financial position, so he could afford to buy ingredients. He cooked for himself and then expected her to clean up, even though she didn't eat much. She felt disrespected, like a servant or dog, which is a serious issue in a relationship.\n\nHe pushed her and restrained her, which is physical aggression and clearly wrong. That alone would make him at fault. The author's response was in self-defense, given his behavior. She's also pointing out that his actions weren't kind\u2014giving leftovers isn't the same as cooking for both. \n\nFinancial struggles shouldn't justify abusive behavior. The boyfriend's actions, especially the physical aggression, are unacceptable. The author's frustration is valid given the situation. She's standing up for herself after being mistreated. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B. The author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions, including the physical aggression and lack of consideration, are the main issues here.\n"
