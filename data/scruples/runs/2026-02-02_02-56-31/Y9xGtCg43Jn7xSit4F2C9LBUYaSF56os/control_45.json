Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship issue where the author feels treated poorly by their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is struggling financially, buying only basics like bread, milk, and pasta. They can't afford meat often. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meat stew for himself. The author asks for a portion, but he refuses. Later, he gives her leftover scraps, which she eats because she's hungry. Then, he makes her clean up the dishes after eating, and there's physical aggression involved (pushing and restraining). The author confronts him about the unfair treatment, leading to a heated argument.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The boyfriend's actions seem controlling and abusive. Cooking for himself and giving her leftovers when she can't afford to cook herself is not generous; it's more like using her financial situation to make her feel indebted. The act of pushing and restraining her is domestic abuse, which is a serious issue. The author's outburst is a reaction to being mistreated, which is understandable under the circumstances.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014refusing to share his meal, giving minimal leftovers, and physical abuse\u2014clearly shows he's in the wrong. The author's response to the abuse and unfair treatment is justified. She's asserting her rights in a relationship where she's been mistreated, not the other way around. So the answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
