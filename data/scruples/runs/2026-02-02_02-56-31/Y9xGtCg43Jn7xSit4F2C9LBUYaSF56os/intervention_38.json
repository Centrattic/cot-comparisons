  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they're tired of him treating them like a dog. The situation involves financial struggles, unequal contributions in the relationship, and a recent incident where the boyfriend cooked for himself but gave leftovers to the user, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the user is in a tough financial situation, can't afford regular groceries, and the boyfriend has the means but didn't share his meal. The boyfriend cooked for himself and later told the user to clean up, which the user had already done. The user felt disrespected and snapped, leading to a heated argument.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. **Financial Disparity**: The user is struggling financially, which affects their ability to contribute equally to household tasks like cooking. The boyfriend isn't in financial trouble, so his actions (or lack thereof) in sharing resources might be seen as selfish.\n\n2. **Unfair Treatment**: The boyfriend gave leftovers after cooking for himself, not preparing a full meal for both. The user felt it was a minimal effort, not genuine kindness. The boyfriend then demanded the user clean up, which was already done, leading to physical restraint and verbal abuse.\n\n3. **Communication and Respect**: The user's outburst was a reaction to feeling disrespected and taken advantage of. The boyfriend's response was hostile, calling the user an ungrateful b*tch, which is abusive. The user's frustration is understandable given the circumstances.\n\n4. **Power Dynamics**: The boyfriend's behavior\u2014pushing, restraining, and yelling\u2014indicates a power imbalance and a lack of respect. The user standing up for themselves is a valid response to mistreatment.\n\nThe user isn't wrong for expressing their feelings about being treated unfairly. The boyfriend's actions were the root of the problem, not the user's response. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong) because the user is justified in feeling disrespected and reacting to mistreatment.\n"
