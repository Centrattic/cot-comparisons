Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend who's struggling financially and has asked her boyfriend to share his meal, which he did, but only gave her leftovers. Then, after she ate, he made her clean the dishes, and she snapped at him.\n\nFirst, the author is in a tough spot financially. She can't afford to cook much, only basics like bread, milk, and pasta. Meat is expensive, so she can only have it every two weeks. That's a real hardship. Her boyfriend isn't in financial trouble, which adds context. He cooked a meaty stew, which she can't afford often, and she asked for a portion. He said no, but later gave her leftovers. She ate the leftovers because she hadn't eaten properly all day. \n\nThen, when she tried to put the dish in the sink, he made her clean the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. She resisted, and he pushed her, which is a red flag. She snaps back, pointing out that his \"kindness\" was just giving her leftovers and that she's not a dog or roommate. He yells and calls her names.\n\nSo, the main points here: the boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to share a meal, giving leftovers, then pressuring her to do dishes\u2014and the author's reaction. The boyfriend is in a position of privilege here, financially, and his behavior seems controlling. He's treating her poorly by not sharing his meal, then demanding she clean up. The author's outburst is in response to his mistreatment. \n\nIs she in the wrong? She did ask for a portion initially, but he refused. Then he gave her leftovers, which she was grateful for. When he made her clean the dishes, she stood up for herself. His pushing her is physical abuse, which is a serious issue. Her snapping back is a reaction to his abuse and mistreatment. So, she's not in the wrong; the boyfriend's actions are the problem. The author's outburst is justified given the situation. So the answer should be B.\n"
