Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship where the boyfriend is financially stable, while the author is struggling with medical expenses and can only afford basic groceries. \n\nSo, the boyfriend cooked a stew for himself. The author asked for a portion, but he said no. Later, he offered the leftovers, which were minimal. Then, after she ate it, he made her clean up, even though he was the one who cooked. The author got angry and called him out for treating her like a dog or a roommate. He responded by calling her a b*tch and said he'd never cook for her again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend is in a better financial position but didn't offer to cook for both of them. Instead, he gave her leftovers after eating most of it. That seems unfair. The author is in a tough spot financially and can't afford to cook much. When she asked for a portion, he refused, which could be seen as selfish. Then, after she ate what's left, he makes her do the dishes, even though it was his cooking. That's adding insult to injury.\n\nThe author's reaction was to snap and tell him that what he did wasn't kind. She's standing up for herself, which is understandable. The boyfriend's response of shoving her and using derogatory language is definitely wrong. Physical restraint and yelling are red flags in a relationship.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author asked for a portion when he was already cooking, which is reasonable. He had the means to cook for both but didn't. The author's frustration comes from being treated unfairly, especially since they've been together for five years. The boyfriend's behavior seems controlling and disrespectful. The author's outburst was a reaction to being mistreated, not an initial wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The boyfriend's actions were inappropriate, and the author was defending herself against his mistreatment. The key points are the boyfriend's refusal to share the meal he was already making, making her clean up, and his violent response. The author's anger is a justified reaction to being disrespected.\n"
