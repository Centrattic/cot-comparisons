Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they're tired of him treating them like a dog. The situation involves financial hardship, unequal cooking responsibilities, and a confrontation over leftover food and cleaning.\n\nFirst, the user is struggling financially and can't afford meat often. They asked for a portion when he made stew, but he refused. Later, he gave them leftovers but then made them clean up. The user snapped, leading to an argument. The boyfriend called them ungrateful and said he won't cook for them again.\n\nI need to determine if the user was in the wrong. The key points are: the boyfriend only cooked for himself, gave minimal leftovers, then expected the user to clean up. The user's frustration stems from feeling treated unfairly, especially given their financial situation and the unequal distribution of chores and resources.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to cook a proper meal for the user despite having the means, giving leftovers, and then making the user clean up\u2014seem controlling and ungenerous. The user's outburst was a reaction to being mistreated, not just about the dishes. They mentioned being his girlfriend for 5 years, not a dog or roommate, which highlights their feelings of being undervalued.\n\nFinancial disparities can strain relationships. The user's inability to afford proper meals adds to their stress. The boyfriend's refusal to share the meal and the physical restraint escalate the conflict. The user's response was a stand-up for their dignity, which is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction of anger and threats suggests a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They're standing up against unfair treatment. The boyfriend's behavior is the core issue here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
