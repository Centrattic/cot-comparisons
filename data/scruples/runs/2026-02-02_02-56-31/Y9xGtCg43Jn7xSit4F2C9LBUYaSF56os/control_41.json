  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend not sharing his cooked meal and the girlfriend reacting to it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman is in a tough financial situation, can't afford meat often, and isn't a good cook. She asked her boyfriend to cook a portion for her when he made stew, but he refused. Then he gave her the leftovers after he ate, which was barely enough. After she ate, he made her clean the dishes even though he was the one who cooked. She snapped at him, calling out his behavior, and he responded angrily, calling her names.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about fairness in the relationship. The boyfriend is not sharing equally, treating her like a servant, and not being considerate of her financial struggles. The woman is frustrated because she's in a difficult situation and feels disrespected. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she asked for a portion, which he refused, but later gave her leftovers. She then had to clean up despite not cooking. Her response was to confront him, which might be seen as justified given the circumstances. The boyfriend's actions seem controlling and unfair. She's not in a position to cook often, and he's financially stable but not supporting her. \n\nSo, the woman isn't wrong for expressing her feelings when she was pushed. Her reaction was a response to his abuse and lack of consideration. The boyfriend's behavior seems more problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
