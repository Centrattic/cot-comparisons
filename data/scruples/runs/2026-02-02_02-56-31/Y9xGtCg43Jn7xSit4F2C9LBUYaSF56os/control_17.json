Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the scenario properly. \n\nThe woman is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's not a good cook, hates cooking, and is currently struggling financially because of medical expenses. She can only afford basic groceries like bread, milk, and pasta. Meat is expensive, so she can get it once every two weeks. \n\nTonight, her boyfriend cooked a meaty stew. She asked him to make a portion for her since he was cooking anyway. He said no. Then later, he gave her the leftovers after eating his portion, which was barely two spoonfuls. She ate it because she hadn't had a proper meal. After eating, she put the dishes in the sink, and he cornered her, demanding she clean the dishes. She pointed out that he was the one who cooked and should clean up. He pushed her and restrained her, which made her snap. She told him off for being unkind and called him an idiot. He called her an ungrateful bitch and said he'd never cook for her again. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's look at the boyfriend's actions. He cooked a meal for himself but refused to make a portion for her when asked. Then, he gave her the leftovers, which were insufficient. After she ate, he made her clean the dishes even though he was the one who cooked. His behavior included physical aggression\u2014pushing and restraining her. That's a serious issue. \n\nThen, the author's response: she asked to have a portion, was denied, ate the leftovers, and then when asked to clean the dishes, she refused and stood her ground. She expressed her frustration, leading to an argument. \n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's refusal to share the meal he was making, giving her inadequate leftovers, making her clean up despite him cooking, and using physical force. The author's financial situation and inability to cook properly due to medical issues are important context. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she asked for a portion of the meal she couldn't afford to cook herself. The boyfriend had the means and cooked, but refused. Then, he gave her barely enough to eat and expected her to clean up. The author's frustration is understandable. She was in a vulnerable position, and his response was abusive. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions, especially the physical restraint and pushing, are unacceptable. The author's outburst, while perhaps harsh in words, was a reaction to being treated poorly and physically abused. In terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's actions are clearly wrong. The author's response, while confrontational, was a reaction to his mistreatment. She's standing up for herself in a situation where she's been disrespected and physically harmed. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
