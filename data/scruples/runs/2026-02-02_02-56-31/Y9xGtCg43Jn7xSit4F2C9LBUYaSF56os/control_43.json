Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author can't cook and is on a tight budget, buying only basics. Her boyfriend cooks a meat stew for himself, offers her leftovers after eating most of it, and then demands she clean up. She resists, leading to a confrontation. She tells him he's being unkind, and he calls her names.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Financially, he's not struggling, she is. He cooked for himself and gave her leftovers, which were minimal. She didn't ask for a full meal but a portion when he started. He said no, then gave her scraps. Then he expects her to clean up, even though he did the cooking. She feels mistreated, like a dog or roommate, not a partner. \n\nThe key points here are expectations in a relationship. In a healthy relationship, both partners should contribute and show mutual respect. He didn't offer to cook for her, gave her leftovers, and then expected her to clean up. That seems one-sided. His reaction was aggressive\u2014pushing her and calling her names. Her response, while maybe heated, was a reaction to his abuse and lack of support. She's in a vulnerable position financially and he's not helping. \n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, he's not being supportive or respectful. She's standing up for herself after being mistreated. The question is whether she's in the wrong for speaking up. Since he was being abusive and controlling, her frustration is justified. She's not wrong for pointing out his behavior. The answer should be B.\n"
