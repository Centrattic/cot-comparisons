Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The story involves a boyfriend and girlfriend in a 5-year relationship. The main issue is about cooking and expectations.\n\nFirst, the author is struggling financially and can't afford to buy much food. The boyfriend made a stew, which was meaty and something the author can't usually get. She asked for a portion, but he said no. Later, he offered her leftovers, which were very small. Then he told her to clean the dishes, leading to a confrontation where the author expressed frustration and the boyfriend called her names.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog?\n\nLet me break it down. The boyfriend is in a good financial position and chose to cook for himself. The author is in a tough spot with limited resources. He refused to give her a proper portion, then expected her to clean up. The author's frustration is about being treated as if she's responsible for him cooking for her, but he's not reciprocating. She's not in a position to cook for herself, given her financial situation.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions might be seen as selfish. He cooked for himself, gave her scraps, and then expected her to clean up. The author's outburst is a reaction to feeling unappreciated and disrespected. In a 5-year relationship, mutual support is expected. The boyfriend's behavior could be considered controlling or exploitative.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled the situation more calmly. But given the context\u2014poverty, medical issues, and the boyfriend's behavior\u2014it's understandable. The key points are the boyfriend's refusal to share a meal and then expecting her to do the dishes, leading to a physical altercation.\n\nThe author's statement about not being his dog or roommate is about the imbalance in the relationship. The boyfriend's anger and name-calling are red flags for disrespect. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself in this situation. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
