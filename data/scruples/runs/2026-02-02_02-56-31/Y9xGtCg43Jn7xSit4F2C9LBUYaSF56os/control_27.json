Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's facing financial difficulties, can't cook well, and can only afford basic groceries. Her boyfriend cooks a meat stew for himself, gives her leftovers, and then expects her to clean up. When she resists, he physically pushes and restrains her, leading to her snapping and calling him out.\n\nSo, the key points here. The boyfriend's actions: cooking for himself, giving her leftovers, then expecting her to clean up. He uses physical force when she resists. The author's response is to confront him, leading to a heated argument where she expresses frustration.\n\nPhysical violence is a red flag. Even if there were a disagreement, using force is never acceptable. The boyfriend's behavior is abusive. The author, in this case, is reacting to being treated poorly and physically assaulted. Her snapping back seems like a reaction to his misconduct. She's also highlighting that his gesture wasn't truly generous; it was minimal and then he expected her to do the dishes, which is unfair.\n\nThe boyfriend's refusal to cook a meal for her when she asked, despite having enough ingredients, is inconsiderate. Expecting her to clean up after giving her leftovers is also unreasonable. The author's frustration is justified given the circumstances. The physical restraint and pushing cross into abuse, which makes the boyfriend clearly in the wrong. The author's response is a result of being mistreated, so she's not the one at fault here.\n"
