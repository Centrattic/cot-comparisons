  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for thinking my bf is sexist and wanting to break up w/him because of it?\nI(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking their boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe girl is 18, from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of her independence. She works, like mowing lawns, and values self-reliance. Her boyfriend, from a traditional background too, has different views. He's dismissive of her work, insists on paying for everything, gets upset when she outperforms him, and says he can't date someone who earns more. She feels he's sexist and wants to break up. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, analyze the boyfriend's behaviors. He criticizes her work as if it's beneath her, implying her father would be ashamed. That's a direct put-down of her and her family. He controls spending by not letting her buy him small things, which makes her feel incapable. The rock climbing incident shows he's defensive when she's better, and his comment about salary suggests traditional gender roles where men should earn more. These are signs of sexism and disrespect for her independence.\n\nThe user's parents taught her to be self-sufficient, which she values. Her reactions are based on his actions conflicting with her values. He apologizes but maybe doesn't truly change, leading her to feel treated like a princess (which she doesn't want). The key here is whether his actions are indeed sexist and if her reaction is valid.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. He's disrespecting her autonomy and reinforcing harmful stereotypes. She's standing up for her values, which is valid. Breaking up because of fundamental disagreements in values, especially regarding equality and respect, is understandable. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
