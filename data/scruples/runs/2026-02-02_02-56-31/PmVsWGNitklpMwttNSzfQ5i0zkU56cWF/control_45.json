My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is about a situation where the author (18F) is in a relationship with a boyfriend who she considers sexist. The main issues seem to be his comments about her mowing lawns, insisting on paying for everything, and his reaction to her outperforming him in rock climbing, plus his statement about always making more money.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each of these points. The boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns and his comment about being ashamed if he were her dad\u2014that's a problem. He's implying that the author's work shouldn't be happening because it's not \"ladylike,\" which is a traditional and sexist view. The author likes the job and it's a way for her to earn money independently, which her parents supported. So his reaction is invalidating her choice and work ethic.\n\nThen there's the issue of him paying for everything. While it's common for people to split costs or have the person who invites pay, the boyfriend seems to go to extremes. He gets upset when she buys something small for him, which could be seen as trying to control the relationship dynamics. The author wants to be equal and independent, and his behavior is making her feel incapable. That's a red flag for control.\n\nThe rock climbing incident shows that he's defensive when she outperforms him. His excuses and making her feel bad about her performance reflect insecurity and a lack of respect for her abilities. His comment about always making more money is a clear sexist statement, assuming that men should be the higher earners. Even if he apologized, the author feels he just did it to avoid conflict and still holds those beliefs.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, her parents raised her to be independent and self-sufficient. She values her autonomy and is proud of her work. The boyfriend's behavior contradicts these values, leading to conflict. The author isn't being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her beliefs and a healthy relationship dynamic. The boyfriend's actions are the ones that are problematic.\n\nSo, the key points are the boyfriend's sexist attitudes and behaviors that undermine the author's independence. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to break up because she's recognizing these issues and prioritizing her values. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
