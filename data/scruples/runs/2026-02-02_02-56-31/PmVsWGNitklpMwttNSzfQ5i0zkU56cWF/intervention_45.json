  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for thinking my bf is sexist and wanting to break up w/him because of it?\nI(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 18-year-old woman in a relationship with her boyfriend. She's raised in a traditional family but her parents aren't pushing traditional gender roles onto her. She's independent, works a summer job mowing lawns, and values self-reliance. Her boyfriend, from a traditional family, has different views.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns. He's shocked and says if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed. That's pretty clear disrespect towards her work and implying that her job isn't suitable for a woman. She clearly states she enjoys it and it helps her financially. His comment is both belittling and insinuates that her father's approval should matter, which she's offended by. That's a red flag for sexist attitudes.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While some people appreciate being treated on dates, he goes to the point where she can't even buy him a small snack without him getting upset. This creates an imbalance where she's not allowed to contribute, making her feel incapable. It's about control and traditional gender roles where he sees himself as the provider and her as dependent. Healthy relationships involve mutual contributions, not one-sided expectations.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his reaction. She outperformed him, and he got angry, making excuses. This shows insecurity and a problem with her surpassing him, which is another sign of traditional gender role issues. Then his comment about always making more money than her and not dating someone with a higher salary is outright sexist. Even though he apologized, she feels he just did it to avoid conflict and still holds those views. That's a major issue, as it's based on the belief that men should earn more than women, which is a outdated and discriminatory view.\n\nShe's comparing her situation to the 1950s, which aligns with the traditional roles he's enforcing. She's not being overly sensitive; she's recognizing his adherence to harmful stereotypes. Her upbringing values independence, and his behavior contradicts that. The key points are his sexist remarks, controlling behavior regarding money, and inability to accept her competence and independence.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and attitudes are problematic and incompatible with her values. She's justified in wanting to break up if his views are making her feel disrespected and undervalued. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
