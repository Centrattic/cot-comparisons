My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a 18-year-old woman who's dating her boyfriend and feels he's sexist. She's upset about his comments on her mowing lawns, his insistence on paying for everything, and his reaction after she outperformed him in rock climbing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of their daughters' independence. Her boyfriend, also from a traditional family, has views she finds outdated. The main issues are his comments about her job, his expectation to pay for everything, and his reaction to her outperforming him.\n\nThe boyfriend's comment about her mowing lawns and her father being ashamed is a red flag. It implies that her work is beneath her as a woman, which is sexist. Then, his insistence on paying for everything despite her wanting to contribute could be seen as infantilizing her, treating her as if she can't handle her own finances. The climbing incident shows he felt threatened by her outperforming him and made excuses, which is another sign of toxic behavior.\n\nShe's standing up for her independence and values, which is understandable. Her parents raised her to be self-sufficient. The boyfriend's actions and comments seem to conflict with her values of equality and mutual respect. The fact that he apologized after the salary comment but might not truly believe it suggests he isn't addressing the underlying issues.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for feeling triggered and wanting to break up. Her feelings are valid given the situations described. The boyfriend's behavior crosses into sexism, so the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
