My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an analysis of the situation presented in the AITA scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the story. The author is a 18-year-old woman in a relationship with her boyfriend. She comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of her independence. She's working part-time mowing lawns and is self-sufficient. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, comes from a traditional family as well but has different views. He made comments that seemed sexist, like being ashamed of her mowing lawns and insisting on paying for everything. There were incidents where he got upset when she outperformed him in rock climbing and made a comment about always earning more than her. She feels he's treating her like a princess instead of respecting her independence and is considering breaking up.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong for thinking he's sexist and wanting to break up. So, I need to assess if her reactions are justified based on his behavior.\n\nLooking at his actions: He commented that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed of her mowing lawns. This implies a belief that certain jobs are beneath women. Also, he insists on paying for everything, even small things like snacks, which makes her feel incapable. Then, after she outperforms him, he gets upset and makes a comment about her salary. These actions could be seen as sexist because they reinforce traditional gender roles where men are expected to be the sole providers and women shouldn't do certain types of work. His behavior might be reflecting outdated views about gender roles in relationships.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on her upbringing where she's encouraged to be independent. She finds his comments and behavior offensive because they contradict her values. She's not just being sensitive; she's responding to actions that she perceives as disrespectful and sexist. The boyfriend's apologies sometimes seem insincere, like when he apologizes for the salary comment but might still hold the same belief, which is a red flag.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, respecting each other's independence and equality in a relationship is important. The boyfriend's insistence on traditional roles and his comments about work and earnings can be seen as problematic. The author is justified in feeling that these behaviors are incompatible with her values. Wanting to end the relationship because of fundamental differences in values isn't being in the wrong\u2014it's about compatibility.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the boyfriend is trying to be a \"gentleman\" by paying for things, which is a common gesture. But the issue is when it's taken to an extreme where the other person's autonomy is denied. The key here is whether the boyfriend's actions are genuinely respectful or if they stem from a belief that the partner should be financially dependent.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. Her boyfriend's actions reflect sexist attitudes, and she has valid reasons to want to break up. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
