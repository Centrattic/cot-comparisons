My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is between a 18F and her boyfriend. She's questioning whether her boyfriend is sexist and if she's right to want to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the author's perspective. She comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of her independence. She has a job mowing lawns, which she likes, but her boyfriend criticized her for doing that, saying he'd be ashamed as her dad. That's a big red flag. Then he insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she tries to buy something small for him. She also mentions he was upset when she outperformed him in rock climbing and made excuses, and he said he couldn't date someone who earns more than him. He apologized but she feels he didn't really mean it.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions seem to show a pattern of gender-based expectations. The comments about her job and the salary statement are clear examples of sexism. He's enforcing traditional gender roles by expecting her to be financially dependent and not in a position where she outearns him. The author is standing up for her independence, which is valid. Her parents supported her independence, so she's not being overly sensitive. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong for feeling triggered, especially given the disrespectful comments towards her work and her independence. He's not respecting her autonomy and is pushing traditional views that conflict with her values. Wanting to break up because of these issues is reasonable. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
