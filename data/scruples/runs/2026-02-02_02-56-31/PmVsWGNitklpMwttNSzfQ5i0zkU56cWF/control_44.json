My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a woman who's breaking up with her boyfriend because she thinks he's sexist. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend comments that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed of her mowing lawns. That's a problem because it undermines her choice to work and implies it's beneath her. The author values independence, and her parents support her being self-sufficient, so her job is her way of doing that. The boyfriend's reaction is dismissive and condescending.\n\nThen there's the issue of him paying for everything. While some might see it as chivalrous, the author feels it's infantilizing. She wants to contribute and be equal, and his refusal to let her buy anything for him, even small things, makes her feel incapable. That's a valid concern because healthy relationships should involve mutual respect and equality.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his reaction to her doing better than him show that he has issues with her competence. His comment about always making more money and not dating a woman with a higher salary is outright sexist. Even if he apologized, the underlying belief that men should earn more is problematic. The author feels he apologized just to avoid conflict, which suggests a pattern of not taking her feelings seriously.\n\nThe author's parents raised her to be independent, and she's proud of that. Her values clash with her boyfriend's traditional views. She's not being overly sensitive; she's recognizing that his behavior is sexist and incompatible with her values. The fact that he expects to be the provider and treats her like a princess instead of an equal is a red flag.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to break up. She's standing up for her beliefs and recognizing that his views are harmful. The boyfriend's actions and comments demonstrate sexist attitudes, and the author is right to leave the relationship for her own well-being and values.\n"
