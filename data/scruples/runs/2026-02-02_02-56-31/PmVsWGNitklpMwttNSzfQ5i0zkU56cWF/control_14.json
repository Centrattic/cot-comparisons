My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is whether she's justified in thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 18, female, from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of her independence. She works hard, mows lawns, values self-sufficiency. Her boyfriend comes from a traditional family too but has different views. The key issues she mentions are:\n\n1. He said he would be ashamed if he were her dad for her mowing lawns. She finds this offensive because she likes the job and her dad doesn't push that lifestyle on her. He also told her to just ask him for money instead of working. She feels this is patronizing and undermines her independence.\n\n2. He insists on paying for everything. Even small things like snacks. She feels this makes her feel incapable instead of appreciated. She's okay with him paying on dates but not for everything.\n\n3. During rock climbing, she did better than him and he was upset, making excuses. Then he mentioned he should always make more money than her and couldn't date someone with a higher salary. She called him out, he apologized, but she feels he still holds those views.\n\nThe author is conflicted because she's independent and values her self-reliance, but her boyfriend's behavior is making her feel treated like a princess, which she doesn't want. She's wondering if she's overreacting or if he's too traditional for her.\n\nNow, considering the points where his behavior could be considered sexist. The first point about mowing lawns: he's implying that it's beneath her and that she should rely on him. This could be seen as sexist because it's assuming that certain jobs are not appropriate for women and that women should be financially supported by men. The second point about paying for everything might be a matter of personal preference, but when he gets upset if she buys something for him, it's dismissive of her contributions and might reinforce traditional gender roles where men are the primary spenders. The third point is clearly problematic\u2014he can't accept a woman being better in a physical activity and has a belief that he should always earn more, which is a traditional view that men should be the higher-earning partner. Even though he apologized, his actions and initial statements suggest underlying sexist attitudes.\n\nThe author's feelings are valid because she values independence and equality in the relationship. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her values. The boyfriend's actions do cross into sexist territory, especially the comment about salary. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship because she's justified in feeling that his behavior is disrespectful and outdated. The answer should be B (No).\n"
