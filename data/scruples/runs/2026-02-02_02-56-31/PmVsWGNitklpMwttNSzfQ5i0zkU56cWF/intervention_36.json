My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is a girl in a relationship with her boyfriend, and she's wondering if she's in the wrong for thinking he's sexist and wanting to break up. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the specific examples she gave. She mentions that when she told him she mows lawns for extra cash, he was shocked and said he'd be ashamed as her dad. That's a red flag because it undermines her work and implies that she shouldn't be doing something he considers a man's job. She also likes the job, so his reaction is dismissive of her preferences and choices.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While some people appreciate a guy paying on dates, she feels it makes her incapable. He gets upset if she buys anything for him, even a small snack. This seems controlling, and it's not about generosity but about enforcing a traditional gender role where she should be dependent on him financially.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his comment about always making more money than her is another big issue. He was upset about her outperforming him, which shows insecurity. Then stating he couldn't date a woman with a higher salary is a clear sexist attitude. Even though he apologized, she feels it's just to avoid an argument, not a genuine change.\n\nHer parents do support traditional roles, but they don't push it onto her. She's been raised to be independent. So his comments and behavior are conflicting with her values. He might see his actions as respectful, but they align with outdated views that devalue women's independence and capabilities. \n\nThe user is 18 and maybe not aware of her own sensitivity, but these are valid concerns. Feeling disrespected and undervalued in a relationship is a legitimate reason to break up. His behavior and comments are part of a pattern that shows sexism, so she's not in the wrong for ending it.\n"
