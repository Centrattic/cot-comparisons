My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's take a look at this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for wanting to break up with her boyfriend over what she perceives as sexist behavior.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author is 18 years old, from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of their daughters being independent. She works part-time during the summer mowing lawns, which her boyfriend criticizes, implying her father would be ashamed. He insists on paying for everything, even small things like snacks, and gets upset when she outperforms him in rock climbing. He also mentions he couldn't date someone who makes more money than him, though he apologized later.\n\nNow, evaluating the boyfriend's actions: His comments about mowing lawns seem to devalue her work, suggesting it's beneath her. Insisting on paying for everything could be seen as infantilizing her, treating her as someone who can't handle her own money. The rock climbing incident shows he's defensive when outperformed, and his statement about not dating someone with a higher salary is clearly sex-based.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, these behaviors are problematic. The boyfriend's attitudes seem to reflect traditional gender roles that don't align with the author's values of independence and equality. The author is justified in feeling respected and equal in the relationship. Wanting to break up over such fundamental disagreements in values isn't \"overly sensitive\"; it's about compatibility. The boyfriend's apologies might not address the underlying issues, as he might still hold those views but just avoid confrontation.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her values and recognizing that the relationship isn't healthy long-term. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
