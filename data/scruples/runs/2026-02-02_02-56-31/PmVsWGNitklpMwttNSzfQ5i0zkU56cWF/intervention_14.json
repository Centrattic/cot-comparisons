My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to break up with their boyfriend because he's sexist. The details provided suggest that the boyfriend has traditional views that conflict with her values. For example, he mocked her for mowing lawns, insists on paying for everything, and made a comment about not dating a woman who earns more than him. She's from a family that encourages independence, so his behavior feels off to her.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the boyfriend's actions. His comments about her mowing lawns imply that he thinks it's beneath her, which is a sexist viewpoint. Insisting on paying for everything to the point of getting upset if she tries to contribute might be overstepping, especially if it's not her preference. The comment about salary is clearly problematic as it's discriminatory. Even though he apologized, she feels it's insincere and that he still holds those beliefs. \n\nHer reasoning for wanting to breakup is based on incompatible values regarding gender roles and independence. She's not wrong to prioritize respect for her choices and equality in the relationship. The boyfriend's behavior seems to stem from traditional gender stereotypes, which are indeed outdated. \n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. She's standing up for her values and self-respect, which is valid. The boyfriend isn't respecting her autonomy, which is a red flag. The fact that he apologized but she doubts his sincerity suggests that the underlying issues aren't resolved. She's not being overly sensitive; she's recognizing that his views are harmful and incompatible with her own. Relationships require mutual respect, and if he can't meet her halfway on these issues, it's reasonable for her to consider ending it. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The key points are the sexist behavior from the boyfriend, her valid reactions to disrespect and control issues, and the incompatibility of their values.\n"
