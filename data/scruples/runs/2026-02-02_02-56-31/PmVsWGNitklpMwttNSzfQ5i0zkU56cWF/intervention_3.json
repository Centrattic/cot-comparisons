  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for thinking my bf is sexist and wanting to break up w/him because of it?\nI(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 18-year-old female in a relationship with her boyfriend. She's from a traditional family but her parents allowed her to be independent. Her boyfriend, also from a traditional family, has views that she finds sexist. The key points are his comments about her mowing lawns, insisting on paying for everything, and his reaction to her outperforming him in rock climbing and his statement about always making more money.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns: he's dismissive of her work and implies her father should be ashamed. That's sexist because it devalues her labor and traditional gender roles. The user finds this offensive, which is valid. Then, his insistence on paying for everything, even small things, and getting upset when she buys something for him. This could stem from a desire to be the provider, but it's controlling and makes her feel incapable. \n\nThe rock climbing incident where he made excuses after losing, and his comment about not dating a woman who earns more. This shows a lack of support for her ambitions and a belief in male superiority in income, which is clearly sexist. The user feels he apologized just to avoid conflict, not genuinely. \n\nThe user's perspective is that she values independence and equality. Her boyfriend's actions and comments don't align with her values. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up against behavior that undermines her autonomy. The boyfriend's actions are indeed problematic and sexist, as they enforce traditional gender roles and disrespect her capabilities and choices. \n\nThe parents are supportive and don't push traditional roles, so the user's views are well-founded. The boyfriend's behavior is outdated and discriminatory. The user is justified in wanting to end the relationship if his views don't change. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
