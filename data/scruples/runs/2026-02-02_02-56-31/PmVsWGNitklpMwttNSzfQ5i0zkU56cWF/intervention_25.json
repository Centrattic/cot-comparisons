  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for thinking my bf is sexist and wanting to break up w/him because of it?\nI(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to break up with their boyfriend because he's sexist. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe girl is 18, from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of their daughters' independence. She works, like mowing lawns, and values self-reliance. Her boyfriend comes from a traditional family too, but his views seem more rigid. He criticized her for mowing lawns, implying her dad would be ashamed, and insisted on paying for everything, getting upset if she tries to buy him things. Then, after she outperformed him in rock climbing, he made a comment about always making more money than her, which she found sexist.\n\nSo, the key points here are his comments about her work, insistence on paying for everything, and the salary comment. The guy apologized for the salary comment but she feels he still holds that view. She's conflicted because he might see his actions as respectful, but she sees them as sexist and infantilizing.\n\nFirst, the mowing lawns part. He's basically saying her father would be ashamed, which is a direct insult to her family and her choice to work. That's not okay. Then, the payment thing\u2014while it's common for guys to pay on dates, when it's absolute and he gets upset if she tries to contribute, it can be controlling. It's about equality in a relationship. The salary comment is clearly problematic, suggesting that a woman shouldn't earn more than her partner. Even if he apologized, she's right to be concerned if he truly doesn't hold those views anymore.\n\nThe user is worried she's being too sensitive. But her upbringing values independence, and she's standing up for her values. The boyfriend's actions and comments seem to contradict those values. So, she's not in the wrong for wanting to leave a relationship where his behavior is sexist and disrespectful to her independence. The answer should be B.\n"
