My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is a 18-year-old woman in a relationship with her boyfriend. She's from a traditional family, but her parents are actually supportive of their daughters being independent and self-sufficient. The boyfriend, on the other hand, comes from a traditional family and has views that she finds sexist.\n\nFirst example: Her boyfriend reacts negatively when she mows lawns for extra money. He says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad. She's offended because her dad supports her work, and she enjoys the job. She feels like he's insulting her and her dad's values. Then he insists on paying for everything, not allowing her to buy him small things, which makes her feel incapable instead of appreciated. \n\nThen there's the rock climbing incident where he was upset she did better than him, even when she didn't comment on it. He then mentions he can't date a woman who earns more than him. She called him out, he apologized, but she thinks he just did it to avoid an argument and still holds that belief. She feels he treats her like a princess instead of respecting her independence.\n\nThe author is questioning if she's being too sensitive or if he's actually sexist. The options are AITA (Am I the Asshole) and whether she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to break up. Let's break down his actions:\n\n1. Dismissing her work by saying her hypothetical dad would be ashamed. That's a direct attack on her independence and her father's values. This could be seen as sexist because it implies that women shouldn't do certain types of work, especially physical labor.\n\n2. Insisting on paying for everything. While it's common for men to pay on dates, the boyfriend's behavior seems to cross into controlling territory when he gets upset if she tries to buy him small things. This could be a sign of him not wanting to share financial agency, which might stem from traditional gender roles where men are the sole providers.\n\n3. The comment about not dating a woman who earns more than him is clearly problematic. It's based on the assumption that men should be the higher earners, which is a sexist viewpoint. Even if he apologized, the underlying belief is still there, and she's right to question his sincerity if he's just trying to avoid conflict.\n\nThe author is standing up for her independence and values, which were instilled by her parents. Her feelings are valid because she's in a healthy family environment that supports her autonomy. The boyfriend's actions consistently undermine her independence and reinforce traditional, unequal gender roles. The fact that he apologized quickly but didn't address the root issue suggests he may not genuinely respect her as an equal partner.\n\nIn terms of her reaction, wanting to break up over these issues isn't being overly sensitive. It's about core values in a relationship. If someone's values clash fundamentally, it's reasonable to consider ending the relationship. The boyfriend's behavior is part of a pattern that's incompatible with her desire for equality and independence. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for thinking he's sexist and wanting to break up.\n"
