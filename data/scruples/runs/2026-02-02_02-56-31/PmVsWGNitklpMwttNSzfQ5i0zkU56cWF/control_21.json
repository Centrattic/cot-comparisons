My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (18F) and her boyfriend, who she believes has sexist views. \n\nFirst, let me recap the key points. The author comes from a traditional family but her parents don't impose their views on her. They encourage independence and education. Her boyfriend, from a similar background, has different values. He was shocked when she mows lawns for money, implying he would be ashamed. He insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she buys him small things. During a rock climbing trip, he got upset when she beat him, and later said he couldn't date someone who might earn more than him.\n\nThe author feels he's sexist and wants to break up. She's unsure if she's overreacting. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong (A) or not (B)? Let's break it down.\n\nThe boyfriend's comments and behaviors are central here. His reaction to her mowing lawns implies a belief that such work is beneath her, which is a form of sexism. His insistence on paying for everything could be seen as infantilizing her, treating her as if she can't handle her own finances. His comment about not dating someone with a higher salary is a direct statement of gender bias, reinforcing the idea that men should be the higher-earning partners.\n\nThe author values independence and self-sufficiency, which her parents instilled in her. She's offended by his comments because they contradict her values. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up against behavior that undermines her autonomy. The boyfriend's apologies seem insincere, as he dismisses her concerns and justifies his actions as \"respectful\" or \"being a man,\" which are outdated and sexist notions.\n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend's actions are indeed sexist. If they are, then the author is justified in her feelings. The boyfriend is in the wrong for his sexist attitudes, and the author is right to address them. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No) because she's not wrong for standing up against sexist behavior. She's not overreacting; she's reacting to harmful and unequal attitudes in the relationship.\n"
