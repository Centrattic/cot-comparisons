My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old female in a relationship with her boyfriend. She comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of their daughters' independence. The boyfriend, also from a traditional family, has different views. He's made comments about her mowing lawns, implying her father would be ashamed. He insists on paying for everything and gets upset when she buys him small things. Also, during rock climbing, he got upset she did better than him and mentioned he should always make more money. The author feels he's sexist and wants to break up.\n\nSo, the key points are his comments about her job, his insistence on paying for everything, his reaction to her outperforming him, and his statement about making more money. The question is whether she's in the wrong for feeling triggered and wanting to break up.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's actions and statements seem to reflect traditional gender roles. He's dismissing her work (mowing lawns) as inappropriate for a woman, which could be seen as sexist. The idea that a man should always pay and that a woman shouldn't out-earn him are also outdated and can be considered sexist. The author values independence and equality, which the boyfriend isn't respecting. \n\nThe boyfriend's apology after the comment about making more money might not fully address the underlying beliefs. The author feels disrespected and the boyfriend isn't getting her perspective. In a healthy relationship, both parties should respect each other's values and work on compromise. If the boyfriend is unwilling to change or truly understand her concerns, the author's decision to break up is valid. \n\nSo, considering the boyfriend's behavior and the author's justified feelings of being disrespected, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her values and seeking a relationship that's equitable. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
