  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for thinking my bf is sexist and wanting to break up w/him because of it?\nI(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 18-year-old girl is considering breaking up with her boyfriend because she thinks he's sexist. The user comes from a traditional family but her parents allowed her to be independent, work, and pursue her own goals. Her boyfriend, also from a traditional family, has different views. He was shocked she mows lawns, said her dad would be ashamed, and insists on paying for everything. Also, he got upset when she did better than him in rock climbing and said he couldn't date someone who makes more money.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girl values independence and equality, which her parents supported. The boyfriend's behavior includes making sexist remarks, treating her work as undignified, and enforcing a traditional gender role where he's the provider. The user feels offended and is considering breaking up. The question is whether she's in the wrong for thinking so.\n\nLooking at the boyfriend's actions: saying her dad would be ashamed for her mowing lawns is condescending and sexist, implying that women shouldn't do physical labor. Insisting on paying for everything to the point of getting angry if she tries to contribute is controlling and undermines her independence. Also, the comment about making more money than her is clearly sexist, assuming that men should be the higher earners in a relationship.\n\nThe user's response is to call him out and consider breaking up, which seems justified given those behaviors. The boyfriend's apologies might not address the actual issues, and he may not truly understand her perspective. The user isn't being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her values of equality and independence. The boyfriend's actions are problematic, and it's reasonable for her to want a partner who respects her autonomy and capabilities. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
