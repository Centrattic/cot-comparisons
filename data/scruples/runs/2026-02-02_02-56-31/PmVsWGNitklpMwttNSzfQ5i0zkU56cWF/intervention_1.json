  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for thinking my bf is sexist and wanting to break up w/him because of it?\nI(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The question is about whether their boyfriend's behavior is sexist and if wanting to break up over it is justified.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's reactions to the girl mowing lawns. He's ashamed of her working outside in the heat, suggesting she should just ask him for money instead. That seems problematic because it's implying that her job is beneath her, especially since she's a woman. The fact that he's comparing her to his dad's expectations is also an issue because it undermines her choice to work and be independent. The girl's parents support their daughters' independence, so this comment from the bf clashes with her values.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While some people might find it nice, the girl feels it makes her incapable. He throws a fit if she tries to buy him something small. This could be a form of controlling behavior, making her feel like she can't contribute financially or show appreciation in her own way. The fact that he gets upset when she outperforms him in rock climbing and makes excuses also suggests he has issues with her being more capable, which can be a red flag for sexism.\n\nWhen he says he can't date someone with a higher salary, that's a clear statement about his views on gender roles in earning. Even if he apologized, the girl feels like he's still holding onto those beliefs. His apology might be just to avoid conflict, which is a pattern of avoiding real change.\n\nThe girl's background is in a family that encourages independence, so her sensitivity here is understandable. She values self-reliance and equality, and his behavior contradicts those values. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to come from a more traditional setup where men are the providers, and he might not realize how his actions are sexist. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and shared values. If the boyfriend can't support her independence and has traditional views on gender roles, it's a significant issue. The girl is not in the wrong for recognizing these as deal-breakers. Her feelings are valid given her upbringing and values. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
