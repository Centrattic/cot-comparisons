  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for thinking my bf is sexist and wanting to break up w/him because of it?\nI(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to break up with their boyfriend because he's sexist. The boyfriend comes from a traditional family and has some views that the user finds problematic.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being ashamed if he were her dad for her mowing lawns. That's a bit of a red flag. He's judging her work, which she actually enjoys and it's a way for her to earn money. That's a classic example of sexism where someone devalues a job that's traditionally seen as menial or not suitable for women. The user is working hard, being self-sufficient, and he's acting like she's being treated poorly, which is condescending.\n\nThen there's the whole thing about him paying for everything. He doesn't let her buy him even small things. The user appreciates the gesture of him paying on dates, but this insistence on him covering all expenses might be another form of sexist behavior. It's about control and traditional gender roles where he believes he should be the sole provider and she should be dependent. The user values independence, which is something her parents also encouraged. She's not trying to be rebellious but is standing by her values.\n\nThe rock climbing incident is another issue. He was upset she outperformed him and made excuses. This shows insecurity and a need to maintain dominance, which can be related to traditional gender roles where men are supposed to be better or stronger. His comment about always making more money and not dating someone with a higher salary is explicitly sexist. Even if he apologized, the fact that he made such a statement is problematic, and the user is right to question whether he truly changed his views or just wanted to avoid conflict.\n\nThe user's parents raised her to be independent, which is a strong positive influence. She's aware of her own worth and capabilities, which is why she's offended by his attitudes. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems stuck in outdated notions of gender roles. The user isn't being overly sensitive; she's reacting to behaviors that undermine her independence and equality in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, the answer would be B, No. She's not in the wrong for standing up for her values and recognizing the sexism in her boyfriend's actions. The key points are his condescending attitude towards her work, insistence on financial control, and the comment about salary. These are valid reasons to reconsider the relationship. The user is justified in feeling that the boyfriend's views are incompatible with her own, and wanting to break up because of these issues is reasonable.\n"
