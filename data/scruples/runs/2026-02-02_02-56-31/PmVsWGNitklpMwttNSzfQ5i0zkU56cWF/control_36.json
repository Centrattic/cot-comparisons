My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the girl, 18F) is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up because of it. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The girl comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of her independence. They encourage her to be self-reliant. She works part-time mowing lawns, which she enjoys, and she's proud of her independence. \n\nHer boyfriend, from a traditional family too, has some views that clash with hers. For example, when she mows lawns, he's shocked and says he'd be ashamed as her dad. That's a problem because he's disrespecting her work and her father's values. Also, he insists on paying for everything, even little things like snacks, which makes her feel incapable. Then, after she outperforms him in rock climbing, he gets upset and comments that he can't date someone who would earn more than him. He apologizes but she feels it's just to avoid an argument.\n\nSo, the key points here are the boyfriend's comments and behaviors that the author finds sexist. She's upset because he's not valuing her independence and is making her feel like he's the provider and she should be treated like a princess. The guy's actions and statements seem to enforce traditional gender roles, which she doesn't agree with.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong for ending the relationship. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the provided text.\n\nHer reasoning is that his behavior is sexist and she can't reconcile the differences. Her parents raised her to be independent, and she feels that her boyfriend's actions undermine her values. She's not being overly sensitive if those are her core values. The boyfriend's apology after the salary comment might not be genuine, and she's right to question his true feelings. \n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, it's about mutual respect in a relationship. If the boyfriend's views are incompatible with her values, then she's justified in wanting to end it. The boyfriend's actions (disrespecting her work, controlling spending, and the salary comment) are problematic. She's not wrong for choosing a partner who respects her independence. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's standing up for her values and recognizing that the relationship might not be healthy due to his sexist views.\n"
