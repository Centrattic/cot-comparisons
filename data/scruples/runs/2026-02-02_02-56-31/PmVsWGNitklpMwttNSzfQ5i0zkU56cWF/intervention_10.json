  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for thinking my bf is sexist and wanting to break up w/him because of it?\nI(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking their boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. The situation involves several key points.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend reacts negatively to her mowing lawns, suggesting a traditional view of gender roles. He implies that her father would be ashamed, which the user finds offensive. She values her independence and the ability to work, which her parents supported. His reaction seems to undermine her autonomy and the efforts her family made to raise her to be self-sufficient.\n\nThen there's the issue of him insisting on paying for everything. While some people appreciate a partner paying on dates, the user feels it's taken too far, especially when she tries to buy small items for him. This makes her feel incapable, which could indicate a lack of respect for her contributions and independence.\n\nAnother point is the rock climbing incident. He gets upset when she outperforms him and makes excuses. This shows a possible insecurity or inability to handle situations where he's not the best. His comment about always making more money and not dating a woman with a higher salary is clearly sexist. The user called him out, and while he apologized, she's concerned he doesn't actually change his views.\n\nThe user's parents encouraged independence and education, which she appreciates. Her boyfriend's behavior contrasts with the values she was raised with. She feels he's being overly traditional and sexist, hence considering breaking up.\n\nNow, considering cultural context, some might argue that his actions are just traditional gestures of chivalry. However, the key here is the user's discomfort with being treated as incapable and the sexist remarks. The boyfriend's unwillingness to see her as an equal, especially in work and career, is a major issue.\n\nThe user isn't being overly sensitive if these behaviors align with her values. The question is whether his actions cross into sexism. The comment about salary is direct, and the other behaviors support a pattern of treating her as less capable. Therefore, the user is justified in her feelings and the decision to break up.\n"
