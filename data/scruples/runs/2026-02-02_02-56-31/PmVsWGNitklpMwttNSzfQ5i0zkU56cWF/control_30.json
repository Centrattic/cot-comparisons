My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the 18F) is in the wrong for wanting to break up with her boyfriend over his sexist views. The situation involves several points.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend reacts negatively when she mows lawns, implying he would be ashamed if he were her father. This is a problem because it undermines her independence and her father's support for her self-reliance. The author feels offended and he doesn't seem to respect her choice to work.\n\nSecond, he insists on paying for everything, even small things like snacks. While it's common for men to pay on dates, the boyfriend becomes upset when she tries to buy anything for herself, which could indicate a lack of respect for her autonomy and financial independence. The author values her independence, so this is a conflict point.\n\nThird, during rock climbing, he gets upset when she outperforms him and makes excuses. Then, when discussing future careers, he mentions he should make more money than her. This shows a belief in traditional gender roles where men are supposed to earn more, which is a sexist viewpoint. Even though he apologized, the author feels he still holds those views and just wanted to avoid an argument.\n\nThe author's parents raised her to be independent, which she appreciates. She's in a conflict because her boyfriend's views clash with her values. The key here is whether his actions and statements are indeed sexist and if the author's reaction is justified.\n\nThe boyfriend's statements and behaviors do reflect traditional, possibly sexist, attitudes. The author is standing up for her beliefs and independence, which is valid. Wanting to end a relationship because of incompatible values isn't being in the wrong. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
