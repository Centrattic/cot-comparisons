My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author, an 18-year-old woman, who's in a relationship with her boyfriend. They come from traditional families, but she feels her boyfriend has sexist views. The main issues she brings up are his reaction to her mowing lawns, his insistence on paying for everything, his reaction to her outperforming him in rock climbing, and his comment about always making more money than her. She's considering breaking up with him because of these behaviors and is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each of the points she mentions. Let's start with the lawn mowing incident. Her boyfriend said that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed of her mowing lawns in the heat and told her to just ask him for money instead. That seems problematic because it's implying that her job is beneath her, possibly reinforcing gender stereotypes by suggesting women shouldn't be doing such work. The author likes her job and views it as a way to earn her own money, which aligns with her parents' values of independence and self-reliance. Her boyfriend's reaction here could be seen as belittling her efforts and making a judgment about her work based on traditional gender roles.\n\nNext, he insists on paying for everything and gets upset if she tries to buy him small things. While it's common for some people to let their partner pay on dates, the key here is that the boyfriend is not allowing her to reciprocate, which can create an imbalance. The author feels this makes her feel incapable instead of appreciated. This could be an issue of unequal contribution to the relationship, where the boyfriend isn't allowing mutual exchanges of care and support. It might be a form of controlling behavior, where he's asserting his role as the provider and not allowing her autonomy in contributing to the relationship.\n\nThen there's the rock climbing incident. He got upset when she outperformed him and made excuses about her performance, even though she didn't say anything about his performance. This could indicate a problem with his attitude towards competition and gender. If he's uncomfortable with her being better at something, especially in an activity that might be stereotypically seen as more masculine, that's a sign of gender bias. His reaction suggests that he can't handle a woman outperforming him in a physical activity, which could tie into traditional notions of male superiority in such contexts.\n\nThe comment about always making more money than her is the most direct. He said he couldn't date a girl with a higher salary, which is a clear statement of sexism. This implies that a woman's success or financial status shouldn't surpass a man's, which is a traditional and outdated view. Even if he apologized later, the content of the comment itself is problematic and indicates a belief in gender-based financial hierarchy.\n\nThe author is comparing her own values of independence and self-reliance, which were taught by her parents, with her boyfriend's more traditional views. She feels that his behaviors are sexist and that they are incompatible. She wants to break up, thinking he's too old-fashioned for her. The question is whether she's wrong for feeling this way.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and modern relationships, there's a growing emphasis on equality in partnerships. Expecting a partner to support each other's independence and career aspirations is common. The boyfriend's insistence on financial control, his discomfort with her success, and his gendered judgments about her job all suggest that his views are not aligned with these modern values. The author isn't just being overly sensitive; she's pointing out behaviors that could be considered sexist in the context of a relationship where mutual respect and equality are expected.\n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's actions could be seen as undermining her autonomy. By not allowing her to work and earn her own money, or by making her feel ashamed for doing so, he's reinforcing traditional gender roles where women are expected to be financially dependent on men. This can be a form of disrespect and can create an imbalance in the relationship dynamics.\n\nThe key here is whether these behaviors cross the line from differing opinions to being sexist and harmful. The boyfriend's comments and actions seem to be based on traditional gender roles and expectations that don't align with the author's values. She's correct in seeing these as issues because they affect their relationship's equality and her ability to be independent. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling triggered and deciding to break up. Her decision is based on values that prioritize mutual respect, independence, and equality, which are widely accepted in modern relationships.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because her concerns are valid and her boyfriend's behaviors do indicate sexist tendencies that conflict with her values of independence and equality.\n"
