  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for thinking my bf is sexist and wanting to break up w/him because of it?\nI(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking their boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. The situation involves several points where the boyfriend's actions and comments seem to undermine the user's independence.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns. He's shocked and says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad. That's clearly a problem because he's not only judging her choice but also belittling her father's lifestyle. The user values independence, which her parents supported, so his reaction would be offensive.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While some guys paying for dates is a common gesture, the boyfriend goes to extremes, getting upset when she tries to buy small things for him. This could make her feel infantilized, not appreciated. The user's point is that she wants to be seen as capable and equal, not dependent.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his subsequent comments about never making more than her. Even though he apologized, the user feels he still holds that belief. This suggests he might have underlying sexist views, thinking men should be the higher earners. The apology seems performative to avoid conflict rather than a genuine change.\n\nThe user is 18, so she's young and forming her views on relationships. She's raised to be independent, which is a positive trait. Her boyfriend's behavior conflicts with her values. The key question is whether his actions are sexist or if she's overreacting.\n\nConsidering the boyfriend's actions: belittling her work, controlling the finances, and making comments about earning potential. These are all signs of treating her as less capable, which aligns with outdated gender roles. The user is justified in feeling disrespected and seeing a mismatch in values.\n\nThe answer here is B (Not in the wrong). The user has valid reasons to feel the boyfriend is sexist, especially with his comments about her work and financial control. The breakup decision is based on incompatible values and respect, which are important in a healthy relationship.\n"
