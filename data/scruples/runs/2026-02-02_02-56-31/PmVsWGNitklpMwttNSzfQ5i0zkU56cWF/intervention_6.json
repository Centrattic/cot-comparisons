  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for thinking my bf is sexist and wanting to break up w/him because of it?\nI(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The user is a 18-year-old female who's in a relationship with a boy she's been dating. She's raised in a traditional family but her parents allow her to be independent. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, comes from a traditional family as well, but his views are causing some conflict.\n\nFirst, looking at the specific incidents. The first example is when she mows lawns for extra cash. Her boyfriend is shocked and says that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed. She takes offense because he's insulting her dad and she enjoys the work. That's a red flag. He's implying that her job isn't appropriate for a woman, which is sexist. She's working hard, earning her own money, and he's criticizing her for it. That's not supportive.\n\nThen there's the issue of him paying for everything. While it's common for some people to let the guy pay on dates, she's not comfortable with him paying for everything, including small things like snacks. He throws a fit if she tries to buy something for him. This could be seen as controlling behavior, making her feel incapable instead of appreciating her efforts. It's about respect and equality in the relationship.\n\nThe rock climbing event and the comment about her salary. He gets angry when she outperforms him, which shows he's uncomfortable with her being better. Then he says he can't date someone who earns more than him. That's a clear example of sexism and gender bias. He's assuming that he should be the higher earner, which is a dated and unfair view. His apology was just to avoid an argument, suggesting he doesn't truly regret his attitude.\n\nShe feels triggered because these actions and comments are against her values of independence and equality. She's not wrong for wanting to break up if his views are fundamentally conflicting with hers. The key here is mutual respect and shared values. If he's not respecting her independence and has outdated views on gender roles, it's a deal-breaker for her.\n\nThe user is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her values and recognizing that the relationship isn't aligned with them. The boyfriend's actions and attitudes are the problem here, not her for wanting to end it.\n"
