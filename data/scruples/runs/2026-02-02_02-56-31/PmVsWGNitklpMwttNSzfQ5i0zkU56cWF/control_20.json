My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 18-year-old woman in a relationship with her boyfriend, who she perceives as sexist. She's considering breaking up with him because of his views on gender roles and expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the boyfriend's actions as described. He expresses that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed of her mowing lawns. He insists on paying for everything, even when she tries to buy small items for him, and he makes comments about never dating a woman who earns more than him. After she outperforms him in rock climbing, he gets upset and makes excuses. These behaviors seem to reflect traditional gender roles and a lack of support for her independence. \n\nThe user is a woman who values independence, as raised by her parents, and finds her boyfriend's attitudes problematic. She feels disrespected and wants to end the relationship. The key issue here is whether her reaction (wanting to break up) is justified given his actions. \n\nFrom a modern perspective, insisting on gender roles where men should earn more and women should not engage in certain jobs (like mowing lawns) can be seen as sexist. The boyfriend's refusal to let her pay her own way and his conditional apology might indicate a lack of genuine respect for her autonomy. The author's desire to maintain independence aligns with contemporary values of equality in relationships. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions could be considered dismissive of her capabilities and contributions. The fact that he quickly apologized but didn't address the underlying issues might support the author's belief that his views haven't changed. Therefore, the author's decision to break up is based on a legitimate concern for equality and mutual respect in the relationship. \n\nConsidering all these points, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship due to his sexist attitudes. Her reaction is justified as she prioritizes her self-respect and independence.\n"
