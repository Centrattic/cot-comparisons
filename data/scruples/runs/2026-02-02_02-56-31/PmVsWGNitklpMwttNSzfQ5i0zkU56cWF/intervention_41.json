  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for thinking my bf is sexist and wanting to break up w/him because of it?\nI(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a 18-year-old woman asking if she's in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. She comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of her independence. Her boyfriend, though from a traditional family too, has different views. He criticized her for mowing lawns, insists on paying for everything, and made a comment about not dating someone with a higher salary.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend's actions and comments seem to reflect traditional gender roles. He shames her for working outside, expects her to rely on him financially, and has a belief about earnings. The user values independence and equality, which her parents also supported. The conflict arises from differing views on gender roles and independence.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a modern perspective, the boyfriend's behavior could be seen as sexist. He's dismissing her choice to work, which she enjoys and finds empowering. Making comments about her father's pride and then advising her to ask him for money instead of working is condescending. Insisting on paying for everything and getting upset when she can outperform him in activities like rock climbing shows a lack of respect for her capabilities. The comment about not dating someone who earns more is problematic as it reinforces outdated gender norms.\n\nThe user is not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her values. Her parents raised her to be independent, and she's trying to maintain that in her relationship. The boyfriend's apologies might not address the root of the issue, and his behavior suggests he hasn't fully embraced equality. Therefore, the user is justified in feeling that the relationship is incompatible because of these views. Breaking up because of fundamental differences in values isn't being in the wrong. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
