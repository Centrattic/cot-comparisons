  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for thinking my bf is sexist and wanting to break up w/him because of it?\nI(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a 18-year-old woman who's dealing with her boyfriend's behavior. She comes from a traditional family but they've raised her to be independent. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, has more traditional views that clash with hers.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend reacts negatively when she mows lawns. He's shocked and says if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed. That's a problem because he's putting her down and implying her job isn't suitable for a woman. She likes the work, which gives her a sense of accomplishment, and she's able to earn money independently. His reaction undermines her autonomy and her dad's parenting.\n\nNext, he insists on paying for everything. While it's common for some to let the person of the opposite gender pay on dates, the key issue here is that he gets upset if she tries to buy him anything. This suggests he's treating the relationship as if he's the sole provider, which can be a sign of traditional gender roles. The user is capable and wants to contribute, but his behavior makes her feel incapable, which is unhealthy.\n\nThen there's the rock climbing incident. He gets angry that she outperformed him, making excuses. This shows insecurity and a need to maintain dominance, which is disrespectful. His comment about always making more money than her is outright sexist. Even after an apology, she feels he's not truly changed, just avoiding conflict.\n\nThe user is self-aware, recognizing her own independence and the clash in values. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her right to be equal and respected as an individual. The boyfriend's actions consistently devalue her independence and equality, which are core to her identity.\n\nTraditional family backgrounds can influence views, but consent and respect in relationships are non-negotiable. The user's values are about mutual respect and partnership, whereas the boyfriend's behavior suggests a more hierarchical view. Since the relationship is causing her distress and he's unwilling to adapt, ending it isn't a mistake. She's prioritizing her self-respect and equality, which is the right call.\n"
