My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for thinking their boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girl (18F) comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of her independence. She's working, mowing lawns, and values self-reliance. Her boyfriend comes from a traditional family too, but his views seem to clash with hers. He's dismissive of her work, insists on paying for everything, gets upset when she outperforms him, and makes a comment about not dating a woman who earns more than him.\n\nThe key points are his comments about her mowing lawns, his insistence on paying for everything, his reaction to her outperforming him in rock climbing, and the statement about not dating a woman with a higher salary. The author feels these are sexist and wants to break up.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior includes making sexist remarks (like being ashamed of her mowing lawns, the comment about her salary), controlling tendencies (insisting on paying for everything, getting upset when she spends on him), and disrespecting her achievements. The author is standing up for her independence and values, which are important in a relationship. \n\nIs her reaction reasonable? She's not being overly sensitive if the boyfriend's behavior is genuinely sexist. The fact that he apologized but maybe didn't truly change his views is a red flag. The author is prioritizing her values and self-respect, which is valid. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). Her concerns are valid, and wanting to end a relationship over sexist behavior is justified. The boyfriend's actions and attitudes are problematic, and the author is correct in recognizing that their values are incompatible.\n"
