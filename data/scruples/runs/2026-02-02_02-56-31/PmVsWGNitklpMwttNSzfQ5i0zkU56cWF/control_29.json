My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me start by breaking down the key points from the story.\n\nThe author is a 18-year-old female from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of their daughters' independence. They encourage education and self-reliance. The boyfriend comes from a traditional background too, but his views differ. He's making comments that the author finds sexist. For example, he's critical of her mowing lawns, insists on paying for everything, and doesn't want to date someone with a higher salary. The author feels he's treating her as a princess instead of respecting her independence. She's considering breaking up because of these issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the boyfriend's actions are actually sexist. The boyfriend's comments about the father being ashamed if the author mows lawns implies that he thinks women shouldn't do such work. That's a traditional, possibly sexist view. Insisting on paying for everything to the point of getting upset if she buys him something could stem from a belief that men should provide financially, which is a gendered expectation. Additionally, his comment about not dating someone with a higher salary suggests he feels men should be the higher earners, which is a dated and sexist notion.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on her upbringing which values independence and self-sufficiency. She's offended by his comments and actions because they conflict with her values. Her parents supported her career aspirations regardless of gender norms, so she's likely more progressive in her views. The boyfriend's behavior could be seen as dismissive of her autonomy and reinforcing outdated gender roles.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong for finding these issues problematic. The answer hinges on whether the boyfriend's views are indeed sexist and whether the author is justified in seeking a breakup over them. The boyfriend's actions and statements do reflect a traditional, possibly sexist worldview. The author is not in the wrong for recognizing these issues and wanting to end a relationship where her values are consistently being disregarded.\n\nPossible counterarguments might suggest that the boyfriend's intentions are good, like being a \"gentleman\" by paying for dates, but the key issue is the underlying sexist beliefs. The author's sensitivity to these issues is valid, especially coming from a family that values her independence. The boyfriend's apologies might not address the root problem, so the author's decision to break up is justified.\n"
