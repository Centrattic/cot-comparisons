My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is a 18-year-old female who's dealing with her boyfriend's sexist attitudes and wants to break up. The main points are his comments about her mowing lawns, insisting on paying for everything, and being upset when she outperformed him in rock climbing.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns. He says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad, which is a judgment on her work. The user values independence and self-reliance, which her parents have taught her. His comment might be trying to be chivalrous, but it's problematic because it undermines her choice to work and implies her job isn't suitable for a woman, which is sexist. So that's a red flag.\n\nThen there's the issue of him always paying for everything. The user says she's okay with dates, but when she tries to buy him a snack, he throws a fit. This could be his way of asserting traditional gender roles where the man should always pay. But forcing this dynamic can make the other person feel incapable or like they're not equal in the relationship. The user appreciates gestures but feels it goes too far, so that's another point against him.\n\nRock climbing incident: He gets angry when she outperforms him and makes excuses. The user isn't even mocking him, just doing well, and he's defensive. Then, when discussing future careers, he says he can't date a woman who earns more. That's a clear traditionalist view that men should be the primary earners, which is definitely sexist. Even though he apologized, the user thinks he just wanted to avoid conflict and still holds that belief. \n\nThe user is in the right to feel offended by these comments and actions. She's proud of her independence and self-sufficiency, and his behavior contradicts that. The key here is that he's enforcing outdated gender roles under the guise of being respectful. The user isn't being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her values. \n\nIs she in the wrong for breaking up? No. The boyfriend's actions and statements show a pattern of sexism, and it's valid for her to want a relationship that doesn't belittle her independence. The best answer is B.\n"
