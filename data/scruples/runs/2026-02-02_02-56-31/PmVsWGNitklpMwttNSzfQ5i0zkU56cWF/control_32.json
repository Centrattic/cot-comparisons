My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is a 18-year-old woman from a traditional family, but her parents raised her to be independent. Her boyfriend, from a traditional family too, has different views. He acts shocked when she mows lawns, says he would be ashamed if he were her dad, and insists on paying for everything. She finds his behavior sexist, especially when he can't accept her doing better than him in rock climbing and mentions he can't date a woman who makes more money. She wants to break up because of these issues.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points where the conflict arises. The boyfriend's comments about being ashamed of her mowing lawns\u2014this is a direct put-down of her work, which she enjoys and finds practical. That's a red flag because it shows he's devaluing her efforts and comparing his views to her father's, which is disrespectful. Then there's the insistence on paying for everything, even small things like a snack. She appreciates him paying on dates but feels he crosses a line. The rock climbing incident and his subsequent comment about salary are also big issues. He's not only making excuses but also stating a preference for not dating someone with a higher income, which is a clear sexist attitude.\n\nThe boyfriend's apologies might be perfunctory, as she suspects, which suggests he's not truly committed to changing his behavior. She's raised to be independent, which is something he's clashing with. The question is whether her reaction is justified.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, expecting a partner to be respectful of her independence, not devaluing her work, and not having income-based prejudices is reasonable. His behavior aligns with outdated gender roles, which she rightly finds offensive. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her values. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
