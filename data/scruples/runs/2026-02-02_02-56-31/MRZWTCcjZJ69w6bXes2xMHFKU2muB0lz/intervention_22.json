  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the user got a significant bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it for a personal project, which they owned the house for. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they expected the money to be used for shared goals like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The user argues it's their money and the house is theirs, so they could do what they want. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she's moved out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nSo, the key points are: ownership of the house, use of personal bonus money, expectations in a relationship, and communication. The user's argument is that the bonus was unexpected and they have the right to spend it as they wish. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that major decisions should be mutual, especially since the project is affecting their shared living space.\n\nLegal ownership of the house is on the user's side, but relationships often require more than legal rights\u2014they involve emotional and practical considerations. Even though the money is the user's, big projects that impact the home can affect both partners. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial planning for the future and shared responsibilities are valid. The user might not have considered how this project would affect their partner's feelings and the relationship's stability.\n\nIn relationships, especially when planning to marry, financial decisions should be discussed and agreed upon. The fact that the user went ahead without discussing it, leading to such a drastic outcome, suggests a lack of communication and consideration. Even if the money is theirs, the impact on the relationship is significant. The fianc\u00e9 feels her needs and the couple's future are being overlooked. So, while the user isn't legally wrong, they might be at fault relationally for not involving their partner in the decision-making process. Using \"found money\" as a reason might not address the underlying issue of shared financial planning in a committed relationship.\n"
