  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house without consulting their fianc\u00e9. The situation is pretty intense, leading to a possible breakup. \n\nFirst, the user got a bonus after landing a good job after being out of work for a few years. They used this bonus to do a big home renovation project. The house is their grandma's, given to them paid off, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible and they should have used that money for other things like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The argument got so bad that she moved in with her sister, and the wedding might be called off.\n\nSo, the key points here are: ownership of the house, use of bonus money, communication issues. The user claims the bonus was \"found money\" and wanted to do the project. The fianc\u00e9 feels it was a major decision without her input, especially since they're planning to get married. \n\nEven though the user owns the house, a marriage involves shared decisions, especially when a major renovation affects the entire home. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that such a big project without discussing it together is disrespectful. The user might be in the right legally in terms of ownership, but emotionally and relationally, not discussing such a significant financial commitment with a partner can be a big issue. \n\nThe user's argument is that the bonus was a one-time thing and they wanted to enjoy it. However, using a life-changing amount of money for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective can seem selfish. Also, the physical changes to the house (digging foundation, tearing walls) make it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there, adding to her frustration. \n\nEven if the user is legally right, the social aspect of relationships requires mutual respect and communication. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding shows how serious the breach of communication was. The user didn't consult her on a major financial decision that impacts both their lives, especially since they're about to get married. \n\nSo, while the user's intentions were to do something fun, the lack of discussion and consideration for the partner's viewpoints likely makes them the asshole here. Answer A.\n"
