Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which involves significant home renovation. The house was given to them by their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's irresponsible because they could have used the money for debt, wedding costs, or savings. She's even moved in with her sister and considering calling off the wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's use of the bonus, communication with the fianc\u00e9, and the impact of the renovation. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to spend it. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint responsibility since they're getting married.\n\nEven though the house is owned by the author, a major renovation can affect the whole property's structure. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that such a big project wasn't discussed properly. Also, since they're engaged, there's an expectation of shared financial planning. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before using the bonus, leading to conflict. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now moving out and considering ending the engagement suggests the author's actions have had serious consequences.\n\nSo, maybe the author is at fault for not discussing the bonus usage beforehand, especially since they're planning to get married. Even if the money is theirs, big financial decisions in a relationship should be mutual. The renovation also makes the house uninhabitable, which is a big deal. The author might not be wrong legally, but ethically, it's about communication and respect for the partner's concerns. So the answer might be A (author is the asshole).\n"
