Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room, leading to a conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author is the one who got a bonus, which is described as \"found money\" that might not come again. They used it for a personal project, which is their house. The house was inherited, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the project is causing disruption and financial strain. She wants to use the money for more practical purposes like paying off debt or the wedding.\n\nThe key points here are ownership and shared responsibilities. The author owns the house, so they have the legal right to modify it. However, the fianc\u00e9 is part of the relationship, and big financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even though the bonus is the author's income, the fianc\u00e9's concerns about future financial planning and the immediate stress caused by the construction are valid. The fact that the project has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to the tension.\n\nThe author might not be legally wrong, but relationships often involve more than legal rights\u2014they involve emotional and practical considerations. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a big decision, which could be seen as selfish, especially when a wedding is involved. The fianc\u00e9's move to live with her sister indicates severe distress, and the potential end of a two-year relationship is a major consequence.\n\nSo, while the author has the right to use their bonus, the way they did it without considering the partner's feelings and practical needs could make them the asshole in the situation. The balance between personal desires and shared responsibilities is key here. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's perspective, even if the legal aspects are on the author's side.\n"
