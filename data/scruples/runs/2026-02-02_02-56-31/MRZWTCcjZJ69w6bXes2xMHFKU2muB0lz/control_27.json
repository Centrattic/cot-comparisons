Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author took their bonus money to build a secret room in their house, which is causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of work for a while, and got a big bonus. They used it to build this secret room with a contractor. The house is their grandma's, given to them paid off, so they own it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think it's irresponsible and they needed the money for other things like paying off debt, wedding costs, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" and that it's their house.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about financial responsibility and shared decision-making. The author might think they're within their rights since they own the house and used their own bonus. But the fianc\u00e9 feels left out of the decision, especially since they're getting married. In a relationship, major financial decisions usually require discussion. Even though the house is the author's, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that such a big project affects both of them, especially since they're planning to marry. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering breaking off the engagement is a big deal.\n\nAlso, the project is making the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, which adds to the conflict. While the author might see it as their right, relationships often require compromise. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because they're concerned about financial planning for the future together. The author didn't consult them, leading to a breakdown in communication. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't discuss the use of the bonus and the renovation with their fianc\u00e9 before proceeding, which is a significant oversight in a committed relationship. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their partner's input and the impact on their shared future plans.\n"
