Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author got a bonus after being out of work for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which involved significant construction. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it was \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to spend it as they wish. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved out and is considering ending the engagement.\n\nSo, the main issue is financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. The author's defense is that the bonus was unexpected and they own the house. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that major decisions should be made jointly, especially when it affects shared living space and future plans like the wedding. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The answer depends on the context. While the author has legal ownership of the house, relationships often require mutual decision-making, especially for significant expenses that impact both partners. Even if it's their money, using it in a way that affects the relationship and shared goals (like the wedding) might be seen as inconsiderate. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a big decision, which could be a key factor. \n\nIn many relationships, major financial decisions are discussed together. The fact that the construction made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to the problem. Even if the author had the right to use the bonus, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's concerns might make them the asshole. However, others might argue it's their money and house. But given that they're engaged and planning to marry, shared responsibilities and mutual respect for each other's priorities are important. \n\nSo, leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly and the action affected both their shared future. But maybe B if one thinks it's their money to spend. Need to check the nuances again. The author says it's \"my house,\" but in an engagement, expectations of joint planning might be reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid, so maybe the author didn't consider her feelings enough.\n"
