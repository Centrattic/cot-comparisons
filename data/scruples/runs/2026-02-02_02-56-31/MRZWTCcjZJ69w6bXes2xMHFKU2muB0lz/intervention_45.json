  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user got a big bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. They didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, who's now really upset. She's thinking about calling off the wedding because she feels the money could have been used for other important things like paying off debt or helping with the wedding. The user argues it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing.\n\nHmm, so the main issues here are communication and shared financial responsibility. Even though the bonus was unexpected, in a relationship, especially close to marriage, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 wasn't involved in the decision might be a big point. Also, the project is causing them to live in the house uncomfortably, which adds to the stress.\n\nThe user owns the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want. But emotionally and relationally, it's different. The fianc\u00e9 feels disrespected and unheard. Even if the money was \"found,\" using it for a personal project without discussion might not consider their partner's needs and priorities. \n\nBut the user's argument is about timing\u2014using a one-time bonus for something they've always wanted. However, in a committed relationship, financial decisions are usually joint, especially when the partner is affected by the consequences. The contractor work disrupting the house makes it harder for the fianc\u00e9 to live there, which is a practical problem. \n\nSo, while the user might not be legally wrong, the relational aspect is where the issue lies. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and shared financial planning are valid. The user didn't consider her perspective, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust. Therefore, the user might be at fault for not discussing the bonus usage beforehand.\n"
