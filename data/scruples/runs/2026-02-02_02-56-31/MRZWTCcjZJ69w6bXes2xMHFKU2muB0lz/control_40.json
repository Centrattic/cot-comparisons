Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author took their bonus money to create a secret room with a bookshelf door, which caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and wants the money used for other purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and they have the right to use it as they wish since they own the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author owns the house outright, so they have the legal right to modify it. But the fianc\u00e9 isn't a co-owner, so maybe the author isn't legally obligated to consult them. However, since they're engaged, there's a level of shared responsibility, even if not legally binding. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that financial decisions should be made jointly, especially when they're planning to marry.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a key point here. The author used a one-time bonus for a personal project instead of shared goals. The fianc\u00e9 feels this was irresponsible. Even though the bonus is the author's, using it for a personal project without discussing might be seen as not considering the fianc\u00e9's needs. The engagement implies a partnership, so maybe the author should have discussed the plans beforehand.\n\nCommunication is another factor. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before starting the project. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is intense, leading to moving out and considering breaking off the engagement. That's a big consequence. The author might have thought they were just using their own money, but the impact on the relationship is significant.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective is that they expected shared financial planning. The wedding costs and debt repayment are shared concerns. Using a bonus for a personal project might seem self-centered, even if it's technically allowed. The author's defense that it's \"found money\" might not resonate with the fianc\u00e9's expectations of working towards shared goals.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to their own money and their house. The project was a personal dream. But the way it was executed without discussion could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's input. Even if the author has the legal right, the social and relational norms of an engagement might require mutual agreement on major financial decisions.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: legal rights vs. relational responsibilities. The author isn't legally wrong, but socially and relationally, they might have acted inconsiderately. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but the author's lack of communication and consideration for shared goals could make them the asshole. The answer might be A (Yes), because even though the author has rights, the action disregarded the partner's expectations in the engagement.\n"
