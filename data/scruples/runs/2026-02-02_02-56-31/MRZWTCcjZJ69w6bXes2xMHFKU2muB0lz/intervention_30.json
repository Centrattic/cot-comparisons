  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room, leading to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The user got a bonus, which they consider \"found money,\" and used it for a personal project they've always wanted. They own the house outright, so legally, they have the right to modify it. They argue that the bonus was a one-time thing and that they wanted to enjoy it.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they feel the money should have been used more responsibly\u2014like paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. She's now considering breaking off the engagement because the construction is making the house uninhabitable, and they didn't discuss it beforehand.\n\nKey points: The user didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which is a big deal in a committed relationship, especially when major financial decisions are involved. Even though the bonus is their own money, relationships require communication and mutual agreement on shared resources when planning for a future together. The fact that she's being asked to live in an unfinished house adds stress, and moving in with her sister shows the severity of the conflict. \n\nThe user's defense is that it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing. However, in a relationship, especially one where marriage is on the horizon, such decisions should involve both partners. The contractor work causing the house to be uninhabitable is a significant issue that wasn't discussed. Even if the money is legally theirs, the fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial planning for their future together are valid. \n\nSo, the user's mistake was not discussing the use of the bonus with their fianc\u00e9 before proceeding. While using the bonus for a personal desire isn't inherently wrong, the unilateral decision and the resulting strain on their relationship suggest that they're not considering their partner's perspective and the shared future they're building. Therefore, the user is partly at fault here. The answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and their actions caused significant harm to the relationship.\n"
