  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user got a job after being out of steady work for several years and received a five-figure bonus. They wanted to create a secret room in their house, specifically in the spare bedroom, which involved significant construction like digging up the foundation and building a basement with a circular staircase. The house was given to them by their grandmother, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible\u2014they could have paid off debt, helped with the wedding, or saved. The user argues that the bonus was a one-time thing and they wanted to use it for fun. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she's moved in with her sister and considering breaking off the engagement. The user is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The user owns the house, so legally, they can do what they want with their property. But the relationship aspect complicates things. The fianc\u00e9 is a partner, so major financial decisions that affect both of them should probably be discussed. Even though the bonus was a one-time thing, using it for a luxury project might not consider the partner's priorities. The fact that the construction is making the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to the problem. The user might be seeing this as their own money, but in a committed relationship, especially when planning to get married, financial decisions that impact both partners need mutual agreement. The user didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before proceeding, leading to a major conflict. So while they have the legal right to use their bonus as they see fit, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's concerns could make them the asshole. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but her feelings are valid if she wasn't involved in the decision. The key issue is not discussing the use of the bonus and the construction's impact on their living situation. So the answer is likely A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the shared implications of their decision.\n"
