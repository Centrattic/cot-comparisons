Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for years. They used it to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they expected the money to be used for shared goals like paying off debt, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it's their money and their house, so they can spend it as they like. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved out and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about financial responsibility and communication. The author might think it's their right to spend their bonus, especially since it's a \"found\" money. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that major home modifications without discussion are problematic. The house is owned by the author, but since they're planning to get married, maybe there's an expectation of shared financial planning. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9, which could be a big issue in a relationship. Even though the author has legal control over the house, relationships require mutual respect and consideration. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but the author's actions might have disregarded the partner's expectations and the future of their shared life. So, while the author isn't the sole problem, their lack of communication and consideration might make them at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes), but I need to check if there's a balance here. The bonus is their income, but relationships often require teamwork. The author's decision might be seen as selfish, leading to the conclusion that they are in the wrong.\n"
