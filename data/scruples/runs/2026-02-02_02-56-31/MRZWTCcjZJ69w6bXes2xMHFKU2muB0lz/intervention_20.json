  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did the right thing by using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the user got a job after years of unemployment and received a bonus. They wanted a secret room, which they funded with the bonus. They own the house outright, so legally they can do what they want. But their fianc\u00e9 is upset because the money could have been used for other purposes like paying debt, the wedding, or savings. She's even moved out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that the bonus was unexpected and might not recur, so they wanted to spend it on something fun. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that major home changes should be discussed. The user insists it's their house, leading to a big argument.\n\nSo, the key points: ownership of the house, joint financial decisions in a relationship, and whether the bonus was a shared responsibility. Even though the user owns the house, in a committed relationship, major financial decisions might require discussion. The bonus is part of their combined financial future if they get married. Also, altering the house structure affects both, so communication is crucial. The user might be in the wrong because they didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, even though they had the legal right. Relationships require mutual agreement on significant expenses, especially when it impacts shared living spaces.\n"
