Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which involved significant construction. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they had the right to spend it as they wished.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about financial responsibility, communication in a relationship, and ownership of the house. The house is owned by the author, so legally, they can do what they want. But since they're engaged, there's an expectation of shared financial planning. Even if the bonus is considered personal income, big expenditures that affect the shared living space could require discussion. The fianc\u00e9 feels left out of the decision, which is a common relationship issue. The author didn't consult them, leading to resentment. The construction also made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, which adds to the problem.\n\nSo, while the author might not be legally wrong, relationally, they might have failed to communicate and consider their partner's feelings. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs are valid, especially if they had prior agreements or expectations. The secret room was a personal want, but using a significant bonus without discussing it could be seen as selfish. The result is a major conflict leading to potential breakup. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both legal rights and relational responsibilities. Even if the author had the legal right, the social expectation in a committed relationship is to discuss major financial decisions. So, the author might be in the wrong for not involving their fianc\u00e9 in the decision, despite owning the house outright. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. The contractor work affecting the living space is another point\u2014maybe the author should have considered how the construction would impact their partner's daily life. Yeah, I think A is the right choice here.\n"
