Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of steady work and received a five-figure bonus. They used it to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible. She wants the money used for debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author sees the bonus as \"found money\" and wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 left and is considering breaking off the wedding.\n\nSo, the main points here are financial responsibility and shared decision-making in a relationship. The author owns the house, so legally, they can do what they want. But the relationship aspect is key here. Even if the author has the right to use their bonus as they see fit, the fact that they are engaged to someone who is upset and feels left out of the decision might be a problem. \n\nIn relationships, big financial decisions usually require communication. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before using the bonus, which is significant because they're planning to get married. The fianc\u00e9 feels that the money could have been used for shared goals like the wedding or debt, which are common financial priorities when couples are getting married. \n\nThe author's argument is that the bonus was a one-time opportunity. But in a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry, financial decisions that impact shared goals should be discussed. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 feels excluded and it's causing such a severe conflict suggests that the author might not have considered their partner's perspective enough.\n\nAlso, the project has made the house hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live in, which adds practical stress. Even if the author owns the house, altering it in a way that affects the partner's comfort is a relationship issue. \n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, the relational aspect is where the problem lies. The author didn't involve their fianc\u00e9 in the decision, leading to a major conflict. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because of the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's financial expectations and feelings.\n"
