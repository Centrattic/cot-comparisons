Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 spending a bonus on a secret room, leading to a major argument with their partner.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after landing a good job. They wanted a secret room, which is a personal desire. They used the bonus for that, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they thought the money should have gone towards paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it was \"found money\" and their house. The fianc\u00e9 moved out and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication, financial responsibility, and mutual respect. The author is using their own bonus, which they might consider their own money, but it's a shared relationship. Even if the house is owned by the author, the fianc\u00e9 is affected by the changes (tearing down walls, construction making living hard). \n\nThe problem might be that the author didn't discuss this project with their fianc\u00e9 first. Big financial decisions, even with personal money, can impact the relationship. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement suggests that this was a dealbreaker for her. The secret room is causing significant stress and practical issues, like moving out. \n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong since it's their house and their bonus, in a relationship, major expenditures that affect both partners should be discussed. Not considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective and priorities might make the author at fault in terms of communication and partnership. The answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consult their partner, leading to a breakdown in the relationship. However, if the bonus was explicitly their own and not part of shared finances, maybe the fianc\u00e9 is overstepping. But given the situation's impact on their relationship, the author's actions seem to disregard their partner's feelings and practical concerns, making them the asshole.\n"
