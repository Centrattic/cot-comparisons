  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation. They got a five-figure bonus from a new job after being out of steady work for a while. They wanted a secret room with a bookshelf door, so they used the bonus to hire a contractor. The house is fully paid for and belongs to them, so they have legal authority. But the fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's irresponsible to use the bonus for this instead of paying off debt or helping with the wedding. She's so mad she's moved out and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's perspective is that the bonus is essentially extra money, maybe a one-time thing, so they wanted to enjoy it by doing something they've always wanted. They own the house, so they have the right to modify it. But the fianc\u00e9e feels the money should have been used more responsibly, especially since they're planning to get married. Her parents might be helping with the wedding, and she feels the financial pressure. Also, the construction is making the house uninhabitable for her.\n\nNow, the key points here: the user is using their own bonus, which they might see as their own money. However, since they're engaged and planning to get married, there's an expectation of shared financial decisions. Even though the house is fully paid off and owned by the user, making such a big change without consulting their fianc\u00e9e could be an issue. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns are about future financial planning and the immediate impact of the construction on her living situation.\n\nIn many relationships, especially ones that are getting married, major financial decisions are discussed together. The user might have thought the bonus was their own to spend, but the fianc\u00e9e sees it as a shared responsibility. Even if the bonus is \"found money,\" the fact that it's a large sum and the project is causing significant disruption could tip the scales. The user might not have considered how this would affect their partner's sense of security or their shared future plans.\n\nAlso, the fact that the fianc\u00e9e is now considering breaking off the engagement is a big consequence. While the user has the legal right to modify the house, the emotional and relational impact is significant. The user might not be wrong in wanting to enjoy their windfall, but the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9e's perspective could make them the asshole here. \n\nSo, balancing the legal ownership and the personal choice to use the bonus against the partner's expectations in a committed relationship, the answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong because they didn't involve their fianc\u00e9e in the decision, leading to major conflict and potential relationship breakdown.\n"
