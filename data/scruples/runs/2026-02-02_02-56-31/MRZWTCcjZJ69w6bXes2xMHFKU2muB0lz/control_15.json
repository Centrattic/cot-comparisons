Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author received a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. Their fianc\u00e9 is upset and considering calling off the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author owns the house outright. They used their bonus money, which they describe as \"found money\" that might not come again. The fianc\u00e9 is angry, feels the money was misused, and the project has disrupted their living situation. The author argues it's their house and they had the right to use the bonus as they wanted.\n\nSo, legal ownership is on the author's side. They have the right to modify their property. But the issue here is more about the relationship and financial responsibility. The bonus was a windfall, but does the author have the right to use it without consulting their fianc\u00e9? They mentioned it's a two-year relationship and they're engaged, which implies shared financial planning. Even though the money is the author's, big expenditures might need mutual discussion, especially if it affects the house they both live in. The fianc\u00e9's arguments are about shared responsibilities like debt, wedding costs, and future planning. \n\nThe author's action of not discussing the use of the bonus could be seen as dismissive of their partner's concerns. Even if the author owns the house, the project's disruption affects their fianc\u00e9's living conditions, leading her to move out. That's a significant consequence. The question is whether the author acted responsibly by not involving their partner in the decision, despite the legal right to spend their own money. \n\nIn many relationships, major financial decisions are made together, especially when it affects the home. The author's insistence on doing it their way without considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective might be seen as selfish, leading to the conclusion that they are in the wrong. However, others might argue that it's their bonus to spend on a personal project, and the fianc\u00e9 overreacted. \n\nBut considering the relationship context and the impact on their partnership, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't communicate the financial decision and the project's impact on their shared living space, which caused significant strain in the relationship.\n"
