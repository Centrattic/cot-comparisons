Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves them using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus from their new job. They used it to build a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement. They own the house outright since it was inherited, so legally they can do what they want with it. But their fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it was irresponsible. She argues they could have used the money for debt, the wedding, or savings. The author sees the bonus as \"found money\" and wanted to enjoy it. Now, the relationship is in trouble, and she's moved out, considering calling off the wedding.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, they have the right to their own property. But relationships involve more than just legal rights; they involve communication and mutual respect. The key points here are: the author didn't discuss the big project with their fianc\u00e9, which is a major financial decision, especially in a committed relationship nearing marriage. Even though the money was their bonus, using a large portion of it on a personal project without consulting their partner might be seen as a failure to communicate and consider shared financial goals. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs are valid, and the author's dismissal of those (saying it was \"found money\") might come off as dismissive of her priorities. The author's insistence that it's \"my house\" doesn't address the relationship aspect. In a committed relationship, especially one planning marriage, big financial decisions should be discussed. The fact that the project has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to the issue. So, while legally they might not be at fault, relationally they made a mistake by not involving their partner. Therefore, they might be the asshole.\n"
