  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the person got a job after being out of steady work, which is a positive. They received a five-figure bonus, which they consider \"found money\" since it might not happen again. They used it to build a secret room with a contractor, tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The house is owned outright by the person, so legally they have the right to make changes. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and this has led to her moving out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The person's argument is that the bonus was unexpected and they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9's side is that they should have discussed major financial decisions together, especially since they are engaged. The project has made the house uninhabitable for her, which is a significant issue. Even though the house is owned by the person, major renovations can affect both partners, especially if they live together. The fianc\u00e9 feels her input was ignored, which is a common relationship issue. The fact that she's considering calling off the wedding suggests the conflict is severe.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. While the person had the legal right to use their bonus, relationships often require shared financial planning, especially with large expenses that impact the shared home. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and the disruption to their living situation are valid. The person didn't consult with their fianc\u00e9, which is a relationship mistake. The fact that they're engaged implies a level of partnership, so making such a big decision without discussion could be seen as selfish. \n\nSo, even though the person isn't legally wrong, in terms of the relationship, they might be in the wrong for not considering their fianc\u00e9's perspective and not discussing the financial use together. The answer would likely be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the conflict stems from a lack of communication and not considering the partner's concerns in a committed relationship.\n"
