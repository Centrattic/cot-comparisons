Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in the house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author got a job after being out of steady work and received a significant bonus. They used this bonus to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright because it was given to them by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she believes the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. She's so upset that she moved in with her sister and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nNow, the key points here are ownership of the house, the use of the bonus, and the impact on the relationship. The author owns the house, so legally, they have the right to modify it. The bonus was a one-time, possibly unexpected windfall. The fianc\u00e9 feels that such a large expense should have been discussed as a couple since they're planning to get married. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, even though legally the author can do what they want, major financial decisions that affect the household and the future spouse's comfort can be a point of contention. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement suggests that the issue isn't just about money but also about communication and mutual decision-making in the relationship. The author took a significant action without consulting their fianc\u00e9, which might be seen as a breach of trust or partnership, especially when they're about to merge their lives.\n\nHowever, the author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and a one-time thing. They might feel they have the right to spend it on a personal dream. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid because financial planning in a relationship often requires compromise and discussion. The fact that the renovations have made the house uninhabitable for her adds to the stress, making it more than just a financial dispute but also about living conditions.\n\nI should also consider cultural or common expectations here. In many relationships, major purchases or renovations that affect the shared home would typically require mutual agreement. Even if one person owns the house, the fianc\u00e9 is part of the household and the decision might have a significant impact on them. The author not discussing it could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and future together.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, the social and relational aspect is where the conflict lies. The question is whether the author is the asshole, which is more about social norms than legality. Since the action caused a major rift in the relationship and didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's input, it's possible the author is in the wrong from a relationship standpoint. But others might argue that personal freedom with one's money is valid. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. The author using their own money might be seen as justified, but ignoring the fianc\u00e9's wishes and the impact on the relationship could tip the scales. The answer might hinge on whether the community values individual autonomy over shared decision-making in a relationship. Given the engagement context, shared financial planning is usually expected, so the author might be considered in the wrong for not discussing it.\n"
