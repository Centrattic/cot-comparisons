  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person took a bonus from their job and used it to build a secret room in their house. Their fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't discuss it first and now the house is under construction, making it hard for her to live there.\n\nFirst, the bonus was a one-time, five-figure amount. The person argues it's \"found money\" since they might not get it again. But their fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible, especially since they're getting married and should plan together. \n\nThe house is owned by the person, so they technically have the legal right to modify it. However, the relationship aspect is key here. Even if it's their house, a major renovation affects both partners, especially when planning a future together. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the money for debts, wedding expenses, or savings show she sees it as part of their shared financial planning. \n\nBy not discussing the decision beforehand, the person didn't consider their partner's needs and expectations. Major life decisions, especially involving finances and living arrangements, should be mutual. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 feels pushed out of the house and is considering ending the relationship indicates a serious breakdown in communication and partnership. \n\nWhile the person's desire for the secret room is understandable, the unilateral decision to spend a significant amount on a personal project without consulting their fianc\u00e9, especially when it impacts their shared life, is where the issue lies. The fianc\u00e9's reaction, though extreme, highlights the importance of collaboration in a relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (they are in the wrong) because the decision should have been mutual, even if the money was theirs.\n"
