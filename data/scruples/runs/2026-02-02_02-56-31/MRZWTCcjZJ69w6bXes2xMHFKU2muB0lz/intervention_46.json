  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in the house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the bonus was a one-time, five-figure windfall. The user sees it as \"found money\" and wants to use it for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they expected the money to go towards shared financial goals like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The user owns the house outright, so legally, they have the right to modify it. However, the project is causing significant stress and disruption, leading the fianc\u00e9 to consider ending the engagement.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and mutual expectations in a relationship. Even though the user has legal authority over the house, relationships require compromise. The bonus, while unexpected, is a shared financial event because they're engaged and planning to marry. The user should have discussed major spending decisions with their fianc\u00e9 beforehand, especially when it affects the entire house and their shared future. The fact that the project is making the fianc\u00e9's living situation unbearable and causing her to move out shows that the decision wasn't just financial but also impacted their relationship dynamics.\n\nThe user's argument about using \"found money\" might hold weight if there was prior agreement on how to handle unexpected windfalls. Without that discussion, using the money for a personal project without consulting the partner can be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and the wedding are valid, especially if they were part of the couple's financial planning. The user's action disrupted those plans and didn't consider the partner's feelings, leading to serious consequences.\n\nIn relationships, even when you have legal rights, emotional and practical considerations matter. The user didn't take into account the fianc\u00e9's perspective and the impact on their relationship. So, while not illegal, the action might be seen as irresponsible in the context of the relationship. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for not communicating and considering their partner's needs and expectations.\n"
