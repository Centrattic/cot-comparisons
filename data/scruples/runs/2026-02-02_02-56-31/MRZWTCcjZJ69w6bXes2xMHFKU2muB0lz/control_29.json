Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of work for years. They decided to use it for a personal project: building a secret room. The house is owned by the author, so they have legal authority to modify it. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like paying debts, wedding costs, or saving. She's even considering calling off the wedding due to the stress and changes to the house making it hard to live there.\n\nThe author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that major home modifications should be discussed as a couple, especially since they're planning to get married. The fact that the author went ahead without consulting her properly might be a big issue here. Even though legally they can do it, relationships often require compromise and communication. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is severe, but her concerns about financial responsibility and living conditions are valid. The author didn't consider her perspective, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. So, while the author isn't necessarily at fault in a legal sense, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's priorities could make them the asshole in the relationship context.\n"
