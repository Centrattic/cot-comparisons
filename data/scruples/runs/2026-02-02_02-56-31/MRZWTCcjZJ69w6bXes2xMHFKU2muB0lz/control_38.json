Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author, let's call them Person A, got a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. They hired a contractor to dig into the foundation and modify the structure. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, arguing that using the bonus was irresponsible and has caused them to consider breaking off the engagement. The house is owned by Person A, but they're in a committed relationship with a fianc\u00e9 who's now living with her sister.\n\nFirst, legal ownership: Person A owns the house outright, so they have the legal right to modify it. But the ethical question is whether they should have done this without discussing it with their partner. Even though the money is a bonus, which might be considered a windfall, the fianc\u00e9 feels it was a joint decision they should have made together. Relationships often require shared financial decisions, especially when major changes affect the living space both occupy. \n\nThe secret room project isn't just a minor renovation; it involves structural changes that make the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9. That's a significant impact. While Person A might see it as their personal space, the fianc\u00e9's well-being and comfort are affected. Moving in with her sister is a big step, indicating high emotional distress. \n\nThe argument centers on communication. Person A didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before starting the project, which could show a lack of consideration for their partner's perspective. Even if the bonus was a one-time event, the fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and shared financial planning are valid. The decision to use the bonus without discussion might have been seen as selfish, disregarding future plans and the partner's input. \n\nHowever, Person A's reasoning is that the bonus was unexpected and a chance to fulfill a personal dream. They might not have intended to cause harm, but the execution lacked communication. The key issue here is whether major financial and structural decisions in a relationship require mutual agreement, even if the funds are technically one person's. \n\nIn many relationships, even if one person earns the money, significant expenditures that affect the household and future plans are discussed together. The secret room project's scale and impact on the living situation likely warranted discussion. The fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests that this was a deal-breaker for her, indicating that Person A might have overstepped by not considering her feelings and the relationship's dynamics. \n\nSo, while legally Person A is within their rights, ethically, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's concerns might make them the asshole. The answer would be A (yes, in the wrong) because the decision was made unilaterally despite the significant impact on the relationship and partner.\n"
