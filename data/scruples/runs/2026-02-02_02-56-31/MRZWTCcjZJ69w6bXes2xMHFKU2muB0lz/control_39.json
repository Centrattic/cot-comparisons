Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which the fianc\u00e9e is upset about.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of steady work, received a five-figure bonus. They wanted a secret room, so they hired a contractor. The house is their grandma's, given to them paid off, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9e is angry, thinking it's irresponsible, wants the money used for debt, wedding costs, etc. The author argues the bonus was \"found money\" and that they can't live in the house anymore because of the construction.\n\nSo, points to consider: Legal ownership of the house. The author has the legal right to modify it. However, fianc\u00e9e's concerns about financial responsibility. Even though it's their house, the fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that this was a joint decision. But the author didn't consult them, leading to a breakdown in the relationship. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e is considering calling off the wedding because of this is a big deal. \n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and the bonus is \"found money.\" But in a relationship, especially with a wedding planned, big financial decisions might need mutual agreement. Even if the author has the legal right, the emotional and relational impact is significant. The fianc\u00e9e might feel disrespected or not considered in the decision. \n\nThe key issue here is communication and shared financial planning. While the author had the right to spend the bonus, the fianc\u00e9e feels it's a major oversight. The destruction of the house (torn walls, foundation work) makes the living situation difficult. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, they have the legal right. On the other hand, the relationship consequences suggest a lack of consideration for the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and financial priorities. \n\nIn many relationships, even with separate finances, big projects affecting the home and shared future (like a wedding) require discussion. The author's actions might be seen as self-centered, not respecting the fianc\u00e9e's concerns. \n\nTherefore, while legally not in the wrong, socially and in terms of relationship dynamics, the author might be in the wrong for not involving their fianc\u00e9e in the decision-making process.\n"
