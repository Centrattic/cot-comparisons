  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThey got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They wanted a secret room for fun, hired a contractor, started modifying the house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinks it's irresponsible, wants the money used for debts, wedding, or savings. She's so mad she moved out and might call off the wedding. The user argues it's their house and the bonus was \"found money.\"\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. Ownership: the house is theirs, paid off, so legally they can do what they want. But they're engaged, so there's a partnership aspect. Financial decisions in a relationship usually require communication. Even though the bonus is their income, major expenses that affect the house and shared life should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9 feels left out of the decision, which is a valid concern. Using the bonus for a personal project when there are shared financial goals (wedding, debt) could be seen as selfish. But the user didn't consult, which is problematic. The contractor work making the house uninhabitable adds stress. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but her feelings are valid because major financial decisions impact both. The user might not be the asshole entirely, but they definitely should have talked about it first. So maybe answer A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't communicate, even if the house is theirs. Relationships require mutual agreement on big spends, especially when planning to marry.\n"
