Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in the house, which the fianc\u00e9 is upset about. \n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after landing a good job. They used it to build a secret room with a bookshelf door, hiring a contractor to tear down walls and dig up the foundation. The house was given to them by their grandma, and they own it outright. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is furious, thinking it's irresponsible. She mentions using the money to pay off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they should enjoy it. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding and has moved in with her sister.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author used their bonus (which is their money) for a personal project, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they were planning to use that money for other purposes. The house is the author's, so they have the legal right to modify it. However, the project has affected the entire house, making it hard to live there, and caused significant strain on the relationship.\n\nEven though the author has the legal right to the house, the emotional impact is huge. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that major financial decisions should involve both partners, especially when planning to get married. The fact that the author went ahead with the project without discussion could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns. Even if the money is the author's, in a committed relationship nearing marriage, big financial decisions often require mutual agreement. The author's actions led to the fianc\u00e9 moving out and considering ending the relationship, which suggests that the decision had serious consequences beyond just financial ones.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, ethically, they might be in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's feelings and the shared future plans. The key issue is communication and shared responsibility in a relationship, especially when it's about a home they're going to share. The project's impact on their living situation and the fianc\u00e9's stress (wedding costs, debt) are significant factors. The author didn't take into account the fianc\u00e9's priorities, which is a relationship issue. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't discuss the major financial decision with their fianc\u00e9, leading to serious consequences for their relationship.\n"
