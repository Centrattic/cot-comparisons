Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author got a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about this.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright because it was given to them by their grandmother. So legally, they have the right to modify the house as they see fit. That's a point in their favor. But the problem isn't just about legal ownership; it's about the relationship with the fianc\u00e9. They've been engaged for two years, so presumably, there should be some level of communication and mutual decision-making.\n\nThe author mentions that the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to use it for a personal project. But the fianc\u00e9 feels that this was irresponsible. She points out they could have used the money for debt, the wedding, or savings. The key issue here is whether the author considered their fianc\u00e9's perspective and the shared financial responsibilities of marriage. Even though the house is the author's, the fianc\u00e9 is involved in the relationship and the upcoming marriage. Making such a significant financial decision without consulting her could be seen as dismissive of her concerns.\n\nThe project involved tearing down walls and digging into the foundation, which made the house difficult for the fianc\u00e9 to live in. That's a major disruption. Even if the author has legal rights, the emotional and practical impact on the relationship is significant. The fianc\u00e9 moving out and considering ending the engagement shows how serious the conflict is. The author might have thought the bonus was theirs alone to spend, but in a committed relationship, especially one moving toward marriage, big financial decisions should involve both partners. The fact that the author didn't discuss this with their fianc\u00e9 before proceeding suggests a lack of communication and respect for her input. So, while the author isn't legally wrong, they might be at fault in the relationship context for not considering their partner's feelings and the shared future they're planning.\n"
