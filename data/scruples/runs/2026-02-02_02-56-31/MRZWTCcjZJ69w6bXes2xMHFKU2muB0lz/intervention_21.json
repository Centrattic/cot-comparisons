  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're the asshole for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the key points: The user got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, hiring a contractor. The house is owned outright by the user, so legally they have the right. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they're considering breaking off the wedding. The user argues the bonus was \"found money\" and their house.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. Even though legally the user can do what they want with their property, relationships involve shared responsibilities and discussions. The bonus might be considered personal, but in a serious relationship like a fianc\u00e9 situation, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The user didn't consult, leading to significant stress and possible wedding cancellation. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and living conditions are valid. The secret room project seems more of a personal whim that's causing practical issues. While the user has the right to their money, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's feelings and the relationship's stability is a problem. \n\nSo, even if it's their house and money, the way the decision was made without discussion is where the user might be wrong. The answer would be A, they are in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the relationship's impact.\n"
