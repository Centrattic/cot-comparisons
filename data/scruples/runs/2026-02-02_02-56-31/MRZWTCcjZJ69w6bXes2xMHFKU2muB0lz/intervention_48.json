  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the user got a bonus from a new job. They used it for a personal project they wanted for a long time. The house is theirs, so they have legal right to modify it. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying debt, wedding costs, or saving. The fianc\u00e9 even moved out and might call off the wedding.\n\nHmm. The key points here are ownership vs. shared responsibilities in a relationship. Even though the house is the user's, relationships often involve shared financial decisions, especially when engaged. The bonus was a windfall, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it was misused. The user might think it's their right to spend their own money, but relationships require compromise. \n\nThe user's argument is that the bonus is \"found money\" and they wanted to use it for something fun. But the fianc\u00e9's concerns are about financial planning and shared future. The user didn't discuss this with their fianc\u00e9 before spending, which is a problem. Even if it's their money, major projects affecting the home and the partner's living situation should be discussed. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but her feelings are valid. The user's action might have disregarded her financial priorities. So, even if legally they can do it, ethically, they should have communicated. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the impact on their relationship.\n"
