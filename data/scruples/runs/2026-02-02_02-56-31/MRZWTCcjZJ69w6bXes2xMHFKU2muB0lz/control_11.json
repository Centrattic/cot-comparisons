Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They used it to build a secret room with a bookshelf door, which involved some major construction. The house was given to them by their grandmother, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels the money should have been used for more practical things like paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. She's even moved in with her sister and considering calling off the wedding.\n\nSo, the main points here are: ownership of the house, use of the bonus money, and the impact on the relationship. The author argues that the bonus was a one-time opportunity and their house, while the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that major decisions should be discussed together.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. They did own the house, so they have the legal right to modify it. However, using a bonus for a personal project without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9 might be a relationship issue. Financial decisions in a relationship often require communication and mutual agreement, especially when it's a significant amount and affects shared plans like a wedding.\n\nEven though the money was a bonus, if the couple is planning to get married, they might be considered a financial partnership. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a big decision, which could be seen as selfish. The construction also made the house uninhabitable, which is a major inconvenience. \n\nOn the other hand, the bonus could be seen as \"found money,\" and the author might have felt it was their choice since it's their property. But relationship dynamics matter here. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs are practical and valid. The author's actions might have prioritized their personal desire over shared financial goals, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn many relationships, major financial decisions are discussed together. The fact that this was a surprise could be the issue. The author might have thought they were acting within their rights, but relationships involve compromise. The fianc\u00e9's reaction shows that the decision had significant consequences on their relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be at fault for not discussing the use of the bonus and the construction with their fianc\u00e9, especially since it's affecting their shared future plans and living situation. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the impact on the relationship, even if they had the legal right to make the changes.\n"
