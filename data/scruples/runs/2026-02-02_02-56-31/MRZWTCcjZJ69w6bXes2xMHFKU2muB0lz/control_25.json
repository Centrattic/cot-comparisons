Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being unemployed for years, which is a positive step. The bonus was a few figures, so maybe like 10k or more. They wanted a secret room with a bookshelf door, which is a fun project. They hired a contractor, started tearing down walls and digging into the foundation of the spare bedroom. The house was from the author's grandma, paid off, so they own it outright. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible. She mentions using the money to pay off debt, wedding costs, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again. The fianc\u00e9 is so mad she moved in with her sister and might call off the wedding. The author's counter is that it's their house, so they can do what they want. \n\nNow, considering the key points: The author used their own bonus money (not shared yet) for a personal project. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint decision since they're getting married. The author might not have discussed the project beforehand, leading to the conflict. Even though the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9 is involved in their life, and major home renovations could affect both of them, especially if they live there. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement shows the severity. \n\nThe author's perspective is that it's their money and house, so they have the right. But in a committed relationship, especially with a wedding planned, financial decisions might need mutual agreement. The author may not have considered the fianc\u00e9's financial priorities (debt, wedding costs) and the stress of living in a house under renovation. Even if the bonus is their own, the project's impact on their relationship is significant. \n\nSo, while the author had the legal right to use their money, the lack of communication and disregard for the fianc\u00e9's concerns might be the issue. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the project's effect on their relationship, despite the financial independence.\n"
