  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room with a contractor, which involved significant structural changes to their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they might break off the engagement.\n\nThe user owns the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want. But the issue is more about the relationship impact. The bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so the user's reasoning is to enjoy it while they can. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's a shared responsibility, especially since they're getting married and there are other financial priorities like debt, the wedding, etc.\n\nSo, is the user wrong? Well, legally, no. They had the right to use their bonus as they see fit. But relationships involve compromise. Even though the bonus is personal income, major decisions that affect a partner, especially when living together and planning to marry, should be discussed. The user didn't consult with their fianc\u00e9, which is a relationship issue. The fact that the construction made the house uninhabitable adds to the problem. The fianc\u00e9's anger is about both the financial decision and the practical living situation. \n\nThe key points are: using personal money without discussion, significant impact on shared living space, and relationship expectations. While the user isn't legally wrong, in a relationship, making such a big decision unilaterally can be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial planning for the future and shared responsibilities are valid. The answer would likely be that the user is in the wrong (A) because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the shared implications of their actions, even though the money was theirs.\n"
