  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user got a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for more practical things like paying off debt or the wedding. The user owns the house outright and thought the bonus was extra money.\n\nFirst, the user's actions: They used their own bonus money for a personal project. Legally, they have the right to spend their own money as they see fit. The house is theirs, so modifying it is their choice. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels left out of the decision-making process. Even though the user had the financial means, a big project like this could affect both partners, especially since they're planning to get married. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual decision-making. The user decided to go ahead with the project without discussing it with the fianc\u00e9. While the money is theirs, major home renovations can impact the relationship. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that financial planning for the future should be a shared responsibility. The user's argument that it's \"found money\" might not consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective on financial priorities. \n\nEven though the user isn't legally wrong, relationships often require compromise and discussion about shared goals. Not involving the fianc\u00e9 in such a significant financial decision could be seen as selfish, leading to the current conflict. So, while the user isn't at fault in a legal sense, the relational aspect suggests that they might have overstepped by not considering their partner's feelings and not discussing the project beforehand. The answer is A, meaning the user is in the wrong because they didn't communicate properly with their fianc\u00e9 despite having the right to spend the bonus as they wished.\n"
