Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They decided to spend it on a secret room project, which required significant construction. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thought the money should have been used for more responsible things like paying off debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author argues it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing.\n\nHmm, so the main issues here are financial decision-making in a relationship and communication. The author owns the house outright, so legally, they have the right to modify it. But financially, the bonus was a shared resource, especially since they're engaged. Even though the bonus was a one-time event, using such a large sum for a personal project without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9 seems like a breach of trust and planning.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid. Marriages and long-term relationships require joint financial planning. Major expenses should be discussed, especially when they affect the property both of you will share. The fact that the construction has made the house uninhabitable adds to her stress, and moving in with her sister shows the severity of the conflict.\n\nThe author's defense that it's their house is partially true, but once engaged, both partners' future is intertwined. The argument that the bonus is \"found money\" might not hold up if it causes relational damage. The secret room project seems more about personal desire without considering the partner's needs and the practical aspects of their future together.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? While they have the legal right to use their bonus as they wish, in a committed relationship, involving the partner in major financial decisions is crucial. The lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's perspective makes the author at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
