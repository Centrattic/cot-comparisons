Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of work for a while. They used it to build a secret room with a bookshelf door, hiring a contractor. The house was given to them by their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they're considering calling off the wedding because of this. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and that they wanted to have fun with it since it might not happen again. The fianc\u00e9 thinks they should have discussed it, as they're getting married and financial decisions should be joint. The project has made the house hard to live in, leading the fianc\u00e9 to move out with her sister.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is the legal owner of the house and had the right to make changes. The bonus was unexpected, so they might see it as a windfall to use for a personal project. They might not have considered the fianc\u00e9's perspective, but they might argue it's their own money and home.\n\nOn the other hand, since they're engaged and planning to get married, major financial decisions affecting their shared life should ideally be discussed together. The project caused significant disruption to their living situation and relationship. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the money for debt, wedding costs, or savings are valid, especially if they have financial goals as a couple. The author didn't consult with their fianc\u00e9, which could be seen as a lack of consideration for their partner's feelings and future plans. Even though the author owns the house, the project's impact on the entire household and the relationship is a factor.\n\nIn relationships, communication about finances is crucial. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 feels unheard and that this led to such a drastic reaction suggests that the author might not have handled it well. While the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a legal sense, in a relational context, not discussing major financial projects with a partner, especially when planning to marry, can be seen as a mistake. The author's actions caused significant stress and potential relationship damage, which tips the scales towards them being at fault in the context of the relationship.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their plans with their fianc\u00e9, leading to major conflict despite the legal right to use the money. The financial decision impacted their shared future and the relationship, which is more important than individual desires in this context.\n"
