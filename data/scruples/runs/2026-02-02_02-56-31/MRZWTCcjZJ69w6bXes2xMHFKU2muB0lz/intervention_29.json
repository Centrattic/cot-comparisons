  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if they're the asshole (ITA) for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the key points: The user got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it for a personal project\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement. The house is fully paid off, owned by the user, so they have legal right to modify it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinks the money could have been used for debts, wedding costs, or savings. She's so upset she moved in with her sister and might end the engagement.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The user's argument: the bonus was a one-time windfall, and they wanted to enjoy it. They own the house, so they can do what they like. The fianc\u00e9's perspective: it's irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married and shared financial decisions are important. The project is causing them to live in an unstable environment during construction.\n\nHmm. Even though the user legally owns the house, relationships involve compromise. The fianc\u00e9 feels her voice wasn't considered. The bonus might be seen as shared money if they're engaged and planning to merge finances. The user didn't discuss the big project beforehand, leading to a major conflict. \n\nThe user's actions, while understandable as a personal dream, didn't take into account the fianc\u00e9's financial priorities and emotional needs. In a relationship, especially pre-marriage, major financial decisions should be mutual. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement shows how significant this issue is. \n\nSo, while the user isn't necessarily wrong in using their own money, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's feelings and future plans makes them at least partially responsible. The answer leans towards A (ITA) because the user should have discussed the big project with their fianc\u00e9 before proceeding, especially given their impending marriage.\n"
