Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where the author used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major fight with their fianc\u00e9. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They used this bonus to build a secret room with a contractor, tearing down walls and digging up the foundation in their spare bedroom. The house was given to them by their grandma, paid off, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they're considering breaking off the wedding. The author argues the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 counters that they should discuss such big decisions together, especially since it's affecting their living situation and the wedding plans.\n\nSo, key points: The bonus is the author's, but they're engaged. Big projects that affect the home and finances usually require discussion with a partner. The author says it's their house, but the fianc\u00e9 is involved in the situation, possibly future spouse. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement because of this is a red flag. Even if the author has legal ownership, relationships require mutual decision-making, especially for major expenses that impact the shared home and financial plans. The fianc\u00e9 feels unheard and that the decision was made without her input, leading to significant stress. The author's argument is that it's their money and house, but in a committed relationship, especially pre-marriage, financial decisions of this magnitude should involve both partners. The fact that the project is making the fianc\u00e9 unable to live in the house adds another layer of conflict.\n\nSo, even though the author has the legal right to use their bonus and modify the house, the social expectation is that such a big project involving shared living space should be discussed with the partner. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the bonus for debt, the wedding, and savings are valid considerations. The author didn't consult, leading to a major rift. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering their partner's perspective and the shared implications of the decision. Answer A.\n"
