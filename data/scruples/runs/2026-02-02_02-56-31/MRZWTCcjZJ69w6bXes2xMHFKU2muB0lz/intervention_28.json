  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user took a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the user's perspective: They got a bonus that was unexpected and used it for a personal project they've always wanted. They own the house outright, so legally they have the right to modify it. They argue it's \"found money\" and wanted to enjoy it since it might not happen again. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's side: She's upset because the bonus could have been used for more practical purposes like paying debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. The construction is making the house uninhabitable, and she feels the decision wasn't discussed properly as a couple. She's even moved out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nKey points to consider: The user didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 before making a major financial and structural decision. Even though the user owns the house, a fianc\u00e9 might expect some level of collaboration, especially in a long-term relationship. Using a large bonus on a personal project without discussing it with their partner could be seen as selfish. The fact that the construction is causing them to leave the house adds to the tension.\n\nLegal ownership doesn't mean financial decisions don't require mutual consent in a relationship. The bonus was a significant amount, and while it's true it's the user's money, the fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial planning for their future together are valid. The user's action might have disregarded their partner's priorities and the practical needs they had in mind for the money.\n\nSo, even though the user isn't legally at fault, the emotional and relational impact is significant. The fianc\u00e9's reaction highlights a lack of communication and consideration for each other's priorities. The answer would likely be A (the user is in the wrong) because the decision was made unilaterally without considering the partner's perspective and the shared future they're building together.\n"
