  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The person got a job after being out of work for a while and received a five-figure bonus. They wanted a secret room, hired a contractor, started major renovations on the house (which they own outright, inherited from their grandma). The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they feel the bonus should have been used for more practical things like paying off debt, wedding expenses, or saving. The fianc\u00e9 is now considering calling off the wedding and has moved in with her sister because the construction is making living in the house impossible.\n\nSo, the key points here are: ownership of the house, the bonus being their own money, and the fianc\u00e9's arguments about responsibility and shared future. The person argues it's their house and the bonus is \"found money,\" while the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that major renovations should be discussed as a couple.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships. When you're engaged, especially for two years, financial decisions that impact both partners' lives should probably be discussed. Even if the house is owned by one person, the fianc\u00e9 is part of the life partnership. Major renovations can affect the property value, living conditions, and shared plans (like the wedding). The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset that she's moved out suggests a significant breach of trust or communication.\n\nThe person used their own bonus money, so legally they might not be wrong, but emotionally and in a relationship context, it's about mutual respect and planning together. The secret room project seems more like a personal dream, but it's causing major disruption. The fianc\u00e9 feels her needs (wedding costs, debt, shared living situation) are being overlooked. \n\nAlso, the contractor is already involved, tearing walls and foundations, which makes it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there. That's a big deal because it's affecting their daily life and the stability of their home. Even if the money is theirs, the impact on the relationship is significant.\n\nSo, while the person might not be legally wrong, in terms of relationship responsibility, they might have failed to communicate and consider their partner's perspective. Using a bonus for a personal project without discussing it with the fianc\u00e9, especially when there are shared financial goals (wedding, debt), could be seen as selfish. Even if the bonus is a one-time thing, the fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial planning for their future together are valid.\n\nTherefore, it's possible the person is in the wrong because they didn't involve their fianc\u00e9 in the decision-making process, leading to major conflict. The answer might lean towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because it's about partnership and communication, not just financial ownership.\n"
