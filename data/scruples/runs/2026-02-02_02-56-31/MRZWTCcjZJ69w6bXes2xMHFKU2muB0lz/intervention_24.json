  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the given scenario is the asshole or not. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person got a job after being out of work for a while, received a five-figure bonus, and used it to create a secret room in their house. The house was given to them by their grandmother, and they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't discuss the bonus money usage, and she feels it's irresponsible. She's now considering calling off the wedding because of this.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong here. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nLet me think about the key points here. The person used their bonus, which they consider \"found money,\" for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't discuss financial decisions, which is a common issue in relationships, especially when planning a wedding. The project also made the house uninhabitable, leading to her moving out. \n\nOwnership of the house is clear; the user owns it, so the structural changes are their legal right. However, in a relationship, especially when planning to get married, shared financial decisions are important. Even if the money is technically theirs, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that major financial commitments should be discussed as a couple. The fact that the project caused her to move out and consider ending the engagement suggests a breakdown in communication and shared decision-making.\n\nThe user argues it was their bonus and their house, but in a committed relationship, especially pre-marriage, transparency about significant financial decisions is crucial. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about using the money for debt, the wedding, or savings are valid. Not discussing it might have led to feelings of being excluded or not respected in financial planning.\n\nSo, while the user isn't legally in the wrong since they own the house and the bonus is their income, the social and relational aspects might mean they are in the wrong for not considering their partner's perspective and not discussing such a major expense. The impact on the relationship is significant, leading to potential breakup. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and considered their own desires without respecting the fianc\u00e9e's priorities in the context of their relationship.\n"
