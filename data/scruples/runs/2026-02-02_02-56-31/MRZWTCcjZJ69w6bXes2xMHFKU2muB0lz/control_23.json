Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author received a significant bonus after being out of work for a while. They used this money to start a project they've always wanted: a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house is owned outright by the author, so they have legal authority. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's irresponsible to use the bonus money instead of paying off debts or helping with the wedding. The argument escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 moved out and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author's actions were based on their own desire for a fun project, using what they saw as \"found money.\" They didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which is a big issue in a committed relationship. Even though the house is theirs, major renovations that affect the structure can impact the entire household, especially if the partner is living there. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial responsibility and shared decision-making are valid. In a relationship, especially when planning to get married, big financial decisions should be discussed and agreed upon. The author's stance that it's \"their house\" might not fully consider the partner's feelings and the shared future they're building together. The emotional impact here is significant, leading to a possible breakup. So, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a legal sense, in a relational context, they failed to communicate and consider their partner's perspective, which is a key factor in determining if they're the asshole.\n"
