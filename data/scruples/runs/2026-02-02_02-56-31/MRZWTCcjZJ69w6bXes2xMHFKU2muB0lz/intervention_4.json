  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to determine whether the person is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe user got a job after being out of steady work and received a five-figure bonus. They decided to use that bonus to create a \"secret\" room in their house with a bookshelf door, a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was inherited from their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is really upset, saying the bonus was irresponsible to spend on this project instead of paying off debt, helping with the wedding costs, or saving. She's so upset that she's considering calling off the wedding and has moved in with her sister. The user argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and that they should have fun with it while they can. They also mention that it's their house, so they have full legal authority. The conflict has escalated to the point of possible relationship breakdown.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Ownership of the House**: The user owns the house outright, inherited from their grandmother. So legally, they have the right to make modifications. However, the fianc\u00e9 is now a part of their life, and their future together might be affected by this decision.\n\n2. **Use of the Bonus**: The bonus was a one-time, five-figure amount. The user sees it as \"found money\" and a one-time opportunity to fulfill a personal dream. The fianc\u00e9 thinks it's irresponsible, especially since they are planning to get married and have financial obligations like paying off debt or helping with the wedding.\n\n3. **Impact on Relationship**: The project has caused significant conflict. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset that she's moved out, considering ending the relationship. The user is defending their right to use the bonus as they see fit, but the fianc\u00e9 feels her needs and future financial planning are being ignored.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and social aspects. The user's actions are legal and within their rights. However, relationships often require compromise and communication. The user didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a large decision that affects their shared living space and future financial plans. Even though the house is in their name, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that major renovations without discussion are dismissive of her concerns and their shared future.\n\nThe concept of \"found money\" is subjective. While bonuses can be considered windfalls, they are still earned money. The decision to spend it on a personal project might seem selfish if it's done unilaterally without considering a partner's input, especially when there are other pressing financial needs like debt or wedding costs.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is strong, but it's important to consider her perspective. If they are planning to get married, financial planning usually involves shared decisions. The user's action might have been a personal dream, but the way it was executed without discussion could be seen as a lack of respect for the partner's financial priorities and the relationship itself.\n\nThe user's argument that it's their house and they can do as they please is legally accurate, but in a committed relationship, especially one that's about to become a marriage, shared responsibilities and mutual decision-making are expected. The fact that the project has made the fianc\u00e9 unable to live in the house exacerbates the issue, as it's causing immediate practical problems.\n\nThe fact that the user didn't discuss this with the fianc\u00e9 before proceeding is a significant point. Even if they own the house, major renovations that affect the structure and living conditions should involve the partner, especially when the partner is part of their future plans.\n\nSo, putting this all together: The user might not be in the wrong legally, but socially and relationally, they made a decision without consulting their fianc\u00e9, leading to serious conflict. The fianc\u00e9's anger stems from feeling that her concerns were ignored, and the project is causing both financial and emotional strain. The user's justification of using the bonus for a personal dream, while valid, might overlook the importance of partnership in financial decisions, especially when it's a significant expense and affects the living situation.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong (A) because they didn't communicate with their partner about a major financial decision that impacts their relationship and future plans, even if the legal ownership is on their side.\n"
