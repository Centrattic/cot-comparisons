  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they got a bonus, used it to build a secret room in their house, and their fianc\u00e9 is really upset about it. The user is asking if they are the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The user argues that the bonus was a one-time thing and they wanted to use it for a fun project. They own the house outright, so they have the legal right to modify it. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they were expecting to use the money for other purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. She's even moved in with her sister because the construction is making living in the house impossible.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual financial planning. Even though the user has the legal right to modify the house, a relationship, especially one that's about to become a marriage, requires discussing major financial decisions. The user didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which is a big deal. Marriages involve shared responsibilities and financial planning. Using a bonus for a personal project without considering the partner's needs and expectations can be seen as selfish, especially when it affects their living situation and future plans like the wedding.\n\nAlso, the fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering breaking off the wedding because of this shows how serious she finds the issue. The user's argument that it's \"found money\" might not hold weight if the bonus was part of their income and they should have discussed how to allocate it together. Even if the house is theirs, significant changes that impact the partner's life should be discussed.\n\nSo, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't involve their fianc\u00e9 in the decision-making process, which is crucial in a committed relationship. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, the wedding, and living conditions are valid, and the user's unilateral decision caused major conflict. The answer would likely be A (they're in the wrong).\n"
