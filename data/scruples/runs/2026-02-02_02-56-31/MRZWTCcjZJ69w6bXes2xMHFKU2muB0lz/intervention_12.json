  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, they got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They used it for a personal project they've always wanted\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house is theirs, paid off, so legally, they can do what they want. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset. She thinks it's irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married and there are financial obligations like paying off debt, the wedding, etc. She's even moved in with her sister, considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo the key points here are ownership vs. shared responsibilities. Since the house is fully owned by the user, they technically have the right to modify it. The bonus is their personal income, so they can spend it as they wish. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that major home renovations without prior discussion are a breach of trust and financial responsibility, especially when planning a future together. \n\nThe conflict arises from the lack of communication. Even though the user might feel it's their money and property, in a committed relationship, especially one that's moving towards marriage, big financial decisions could be expected to involve the partner. The scale of the project (digging foundations, tearing walls) makes the house uninhabitable, which adds to the fianc\u00e9's frustration. \n\nThe user argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, which is a common justification for splurging. But the fianc\u00e9 sees it as a missed opportunity to address shared financial goals. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? It's a mix of factors. Legally and financially, they're in the right, but emotionally and relationally, the lack of discussion and the project's impact on their partner's life are significant. The answer might hinge on whether respecting the partner's concerns and involving them in such a major decision is considered necessary in a relationship. So, while not legally wrong, socially or relationally, it could be seen as a mistake, making the answer A (Yes, they're in the wrong) because the issue is more about communication and shared partnership than the legal ownership.\n"
