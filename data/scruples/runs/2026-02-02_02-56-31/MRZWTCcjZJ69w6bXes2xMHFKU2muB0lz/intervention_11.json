  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person received a five-figure bonus after a job they got after being out of work. They used this money to start a project involving structural changes to their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling it's irresponsible and that they should have discussed it. The argument is so bad she's moved out and considering calling off the wedding.\n\nSo, the user's arguments: The bonus was a one-time thing, \"found money,\" and they own the house, so it's their decision. The fianc\u00e9's side is about responsibility, financial planning for their future (wedding, debt, etc.), and the disruption caused by the construction.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, even if the user has the legal right to use their own money, major financial decisions involving shared living spaces and future plans (like a wedding) usually require communication and mutual agreement. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 wasn't consulted suggests a lack of partnership in decision-making. The user might have assumed their ownership of the house gave them sole control, but in a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry, financial decisions affect both parties. The project's impact on the fianc\u00e9's ability to live in the house adds another layer of conflict.\n\nHowever, the user's perspective is that the bonus was unexpected and a one-time opportunity. They might not have considered the fianc\u00e9's financial priorities. The issue here is about shared responsibility versus individual autonomy. Since they're engaged, future expenses and financial planning are typically joint matters. The user's action, while legally their right, could be seen as disregarding the fianc\u00e9's concerns and the partnership's needs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, using a bonus for personal desires without mutual discussion might be seen as selfish, especially when it affects shared life plans. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is valid because the decision impacts their joint future. The user's defense that it's their own money and house is partially correct, but in a relationship, major financial moves often require collaboration. The escalation to considering ending the relationship indicates a significant breach in communication and respect for each other's priorities.\n\nSo, the user's actions, while legally permissible, may have been emotionally and relationally insensitive. They didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective and the implications on their shared life. Therefore, the answer would be AITA A (Yes, in the wrong) because the decision was made without considering the partner's input and the project's impact on their relationship and future plans.\n"
