Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room, causing conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it for a personal project they've always wanted. The house is theirs, so legally they can do what they want. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they thought the money should have been used for shared goals like paying off debt or the wedding. \n\nThe key points here are communication and shared financial planning. Even though the author owns the house, a significant relationship like a fianc\u00e9 would typically expect discussions about major expenditures, especially when planning to get married. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding shows how serious the issue is. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consult their partner on how to use the bonus, which is a big decision in a committed relationship. Financial decisions, especially large ones, should be mutual. The author's argument that it's their house might be valid legally, but emotionally and relationally, it's about partnership. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted unilaterally despite the shared future with their fianc\u00e9.\n"
