  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9. The main points to consider are responsibility of the bonus money, ownership of the house, and the impact on the relationship.\n\nFirst, the bonus was a five-figure amount. The person argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to use it for a fun project. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used that money to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The question here is whether using the bonus for personal enjoyment is irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married. Financial planning is important in a relationship, and major expenses should probably be discussed together. Even though the bonus is the person's own money, when you're engaged, shared financial decisions become important. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 feels the project is making the house uninhabitable adds another layer. The person says it's their house, but the work is affecting both of them since they're planning to marry. The contractor work causing structural changes could definitely impact the living situation and maybe the value of the house. The fianc\u00e9 moving out and considering ending the relationship shows the severity of the conflict. So, even though the person has the legal right to modify their house, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's financial concerns might be where they went wrong. The key is whether they should have discussed the project together, especially since it's a significant expense and affects their shared future. So, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the shared financial responsibilities that come with marriage.\n"
