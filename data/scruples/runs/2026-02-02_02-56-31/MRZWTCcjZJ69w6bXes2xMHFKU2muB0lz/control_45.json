Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big conflict with their partner. \n\nFirst, the key points. The author got a job after being unemployed for years, received a five-figure bonus. They used this money to start building a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's irresponsible because they could have used the money for debt, wedding expenses, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author owns the house, so they have the legal right to modify it. The bonus is their personal income, so they might feel it's their choice to spend it. However, the relationship aspect is important. They are engaged, and major financial decisions should ideally be discussed. The fianc\u00e9 feels excluded and that the project is causing them to not be able to live in the house, which is a significant issue. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the relationship because of this shows how serious it is to her. \n\nEven though the author has the right to their money and the house, relationships often require compromise and communication. The surprise nature of the project and the scale of the renovation might have been a factor. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9, which is a red flag in a committed relationship. Even if the money is theirs, the impact on the shared living space and the fianc\u00e9's stress about financial priorities might mean the author didn't consider her perspective. \n\nSo, the answer is not straightforward. Legally, they're not wrong, but in the context of the relationship, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's concerns might make them the asshole. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but her feelings are valid. The author's actions, while legally and financially defensible, may be seen as selfish in the relationship context. So, probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't discuss the big purchase and the project is affecting their partner's living situation and their relationship."
