  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're the asshole for using their bonus to create a secret room, causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, the key points: The person got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which required significant construction. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinks it's irresponsible, and they're considering breaking up.\n\nThey own the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want. But the relationship aspect complicates things. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without discussion, leading to her moving out. Even though the bonus is \"found money,\" the fianc\u00e9e feels it should have been a joint decision, especially since they're planning to get married. \n\nIn relationships, especially when engaged, major financial decisions that affect both partners (like big home renovations) usually require mutual agreement. The person might not be legally wrong, but socially or emotionally, they might have overstepped by not including their partner in the decision. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests that the lack of communication and the disruption to their shared living space are significant issues.\n\nEven though the bonus was a one-time thing, the fianc\u00e9e's priorities (paying off debt, wedding expenses) are valid. The person's argument about using the bonus for a fun project might not take into account the fianc\u00e9's financial concerns and the impact on their relationship. \n\nSo, while there's no legal fault, the social expectation in a committed relationship like engagement is to discuss major financial decisions. The answer might lean towards A (they're in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and considering the partner's perspective.\n"
