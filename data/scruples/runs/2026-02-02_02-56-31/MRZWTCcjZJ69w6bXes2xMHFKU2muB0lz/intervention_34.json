  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big argument with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, they got a bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it for a personal project they always wanted. The house is theirs, so they have legal authority. But their fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for debts or the wedding. She's moved out and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication, shared financial responsibility in a relationship, and respecting each other's priorities. Even though the user has legal ownership of the house, a significant financial decision affecting their shared life might require discussion. The fianc\u00e9 feels her concerns weren't considered, leading to a breakdown in the relationship. \n\nThe user argues it's \"found money\" and their house, but relationships often require compromise. The fact that their actions made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds another layer. So, while the user isn't legally wrong, emotionally and in terms of relationship dynamics, they might have failed to communicate or consider their partner's perspective. \n\nSo, probably answer A (they're in the wrong) because despite legal ownership, the lack of mutual decision-making and the impact on the relationship is a key issue.\n"
