  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user got a bonus from their job, which they consider \"found money,\" and used it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for more responsible things like paying off debt or the wedding. The user owns the house outright, so they have legal authority to make changes.\n\nFirst, the bonus: the user says it's \"found money\" that might not come again. But the fianc\u00e9 argues that they should have discussed major financial decisions together, especially since they're planning to get married. Even if the user owns the house, making significant structural changes could affect the entire property, possibly its value, and their shared living situation. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's anger seems to stem from a lack of communication and the financial implications. The user made a big decision without consulting their partner, which could be a key issue. Even though the user has the legal right to modify the house, relationships often require compromise and mutual agreement on major expenses. \n\nAlso, the fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding because of this suggests that the issue is about more than just the money or the renovation. It's about respect for each other's priorities and financial planning. The user's argument that it's their house might be true legally, but in a committed relationship, especially one leading to marriage, joint financial decisions are usually expected. \n\nSo, while the user isn't necessarily acting illegally or unethically in using their bonus, not discussing such a significant and life-impacting project with their fianc\u00e9 is a problem. The fianc\u00e9 feels disrespected and excluded from major decisions that affect their shared future. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not considering their partner's perspective and not communicating properly. \n\nAnswer A.\n"
