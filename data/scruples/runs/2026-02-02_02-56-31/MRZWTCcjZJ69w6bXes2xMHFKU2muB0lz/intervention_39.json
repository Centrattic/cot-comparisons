  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the user got a bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it for a personal project they've always wanted. The house is fully paid for and owned by them. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying debt, the wedding, or saving. She's even moved in with her sister and considering ending the engagement.\n\nNow, the user claims the bonus was \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to use it as they wish. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it was irresponsible and that major home renovations made living there impossible. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. Legally, the user owns the house, so they can modify it. But relationships involve shared responsibilities and mutual discussions. Even though it's their house, a major renovation affecting the entire home might require discussion with a partner, especially since they're engaged. The bonus was unexpected, but the fianc\u00e9 has valid concerns about financial planning for their future together. The user's action might have disregarded her priorities and caused significant stress. \n\nThe key points are: ownership vs. partnership, communication, and financial responsibility. While the user had the right to spend the bonus, the lack of discussion and the impact on their partner's comfort and the wedding plans might make them at fault. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is strong, but her concerns are legitimate. The user might not be the asshole entirely, but there's a clear communication breakdown and failure to consider the partner's perspective. So, the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because they didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 on such a significant financial and structural decision, leading to major conflict.\n"
