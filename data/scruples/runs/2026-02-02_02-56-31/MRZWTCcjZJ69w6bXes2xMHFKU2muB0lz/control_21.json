Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the situation is about whether the author is the asshole for using their bonus to create a secret room, leading to a big fight with their fianc\u00e9. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after landing a good job. They wanted a secret room, hired a contractor, started major renovations. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they might break up. The author argues it's \"found money,\" and they own the house, so it's their choice. The fianc\u00e9 feels they should have discussed it and that the renovations are making the house uninhabitable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did use their own bonus money. If it's their own money, does that matter? But they're engaged, so maybe they should consider each other's financial goals. The fianc\u00e9 wanted to use the money for debt, wedding, or savings. Even if it's the author's money, maybe they should have discussed it since they're planning to get married. \n\nThe house is the author's, but the fianc\u00e9 is living there. If the renovations are making it impossible for her to live there, that's a problem. Maybe they should have considered how the project would affect their shared living situation. Even if the author has legal authority, it's about relationships and mutual respect. \n\nSo, maybe the author didn't do anything legally wrong, but in terms of the relationship, they might have overstepped. The key points are not communicating with the fianc\u00e9 and causing significant disruption. Even though the money is theirs, major life decisions affecting a partner should be discussed. So the answer might be AITA because they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective and the impact on their relationship.\n"
