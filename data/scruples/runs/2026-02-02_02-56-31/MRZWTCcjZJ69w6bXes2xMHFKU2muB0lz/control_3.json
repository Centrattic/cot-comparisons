Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who used their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of work for a while and received a five-figure bonus. They decided to use that money to build a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house was given to them by their grandma and they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible to use the bonus money instead of paying off debt or helping with the wedding costs. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and they wanted to use it for something fun. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is so upset she's considering calling off the wedding and moved in with her sister.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about financial responsibility, shared expectations in a relationship, and ownership of the house. The author legally owns the house, so they have the right to make changes. But the issue isn't just legal; it's about the relationship. The bonus was the author's, but they're getting married, which implies shared financial planning. Even if the bonus is personal, major expenditures that affect the shared living space could be something to discuss, especially if the partner is involved in the household.\n\nThe author says they didn't discuss it with the fianc\u00e9 before starting the project. That's a problem because big projects can have implications beyond just the money. Tearing down walls and digging into the foundation would affect the entire house, which the fianc\u00e9 presumably lives in or will be living in. Even if the author owns it, the fianc\u00e9's comfort and input might matter, especially since they're planning to marry. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's concerns are about using money for something seen as a luxury when it could be used to reduce debt or help with wedding costs. The author's perspective is that the bonus is a one-time thing and they wanted to enjoy it. But in a relationship, especially one that's leading to marriage, financial decisions can be a shared responsibility. The author might have a right to spend their own money, but not consulting their partner on such a significant and intrusive home project could be seen as dismissive of their partner's feelings and financial priorities. \n\nAlso, the fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering ending the engagement suggests that the disagreement is more than just about money. It's about mutual respect and communication. Even if the author is legally in their right to spend the bonus and modify the house, the way they went about it without discussing with the fianc\u00e9 might be the real issue here. The author's actions may have shown a lack of consideration for their partner's viewpoints and the shared future they're building together. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily at fault for wanting to spend their bonus on a personal project, the lack of communication and the impact on the relationship could make them the asshole if they didn't make an effort to understand their fianc\u00e9's concerns. The wrong here isn't about the legal ownership or the spending per se, but about the failure to communicate and consider their partner's feelings in a major decision that affects both of them.\n"
