Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the author used their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of work for a few years and received a five-figure bonus. They used that bonus to start a project they always wanted\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house is owned by the author, given by their grandma, and they have legal authority to make changes. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible. She mentions using the money to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they should enjoy it. The conflict escalated to the point where she moved in with her sister and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider factors like communication, financial responsibility, and the state of their relationship. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before spending the bonus, which could be a key issue. Even though the house is the author's, major renovations can affect the fianc\u00e9's living situation. The author might have assumed they could spend the bonus as they wanted without discussion. However, since they're engaged, financial decisions might be expected to be shared. The author's stance is that it's their money and house, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint responsibility. \n\nThe problem here is communication. The author didn't discuss the use of the bonus with their fianc\u00e9, which is a big oversight in a committed relationship, especially when planning to get married. The fact that the project is causing her to leave and consider ending the engagement shows the severity of the situation. Even if the author had the legal right to make the changes, the emotional and relational impact is significant. The author's argument about the bonus being a one-time thing might be valid, but the decision to spend it without mutual agreement is where the fault lies. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their intentions with their fianc\u00e9, leading to a major conflict that affects their relationship's future.\n"
