Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author received a sizable bonus after being out of steady work for years. They decided to use it for a personal project\u2014a secret room. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and that the money could have been used for more pressing needs like paying off debt or wedding expenses. The argument escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 is considering breaking off the engagement and has moved in with her sister.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, ownership of the house is with the author, so they have the legal right to make changes. However, the situation involves a fianc\u00e9, which complicates things. Even though it's their house, relationships require communication and mutual decision-making. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 about the big project, leading to conflict. The bonus is seen as \"found money,\" but the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that they should plan jointly for their future, including financial decisions. The project has made the house uninhabitable for her, which is a significant issue.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to use their bonus as they see fit, especially if it's a one-time windfall. On the other hand, major home renovations without discussing with a partner can be seen as selfish, especially when it affects shared living space and adds stress to the relationship. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement shows how serious the breach of communication was.\n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not discussing the project beforehand. Even though they have the legal right, relationships involve shared responsibilities and respecting each other's input. The author's actions, while legally justified, may have disregarded the partner's concerns and needs, leading to a major breakdown in the relationship. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
