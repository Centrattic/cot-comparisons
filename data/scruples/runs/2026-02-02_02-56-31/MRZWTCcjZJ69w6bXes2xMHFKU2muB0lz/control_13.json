Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took their bonus to create a secret room is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The author got a five-figure bonus after a long period without steady work. They used it to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright. Their fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling it's irresponsible when they could have used the money for other purposes like debt, wedding costs, or savings. The project has disrupted their living situation, leading to a possible breakup.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author's side: the bonus was unexpected and might not recur. They own the house, so they argue it's their right to modify it. The fianc\u00e9's side: the money could have been used for shared financial goals, and the project is causing significant stress and disruption. \n\nThe main issues here are financial responsibility, communication, and shared decision-making in a relationship. Even though the author legally owns the house, a major renovation affects their partner's living conditions. Using a bonus for personal desire without considering the partner's perspective might be seen as self-centered. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and shared expenses (like the wedding) are valid, as marriage typically involves joint financial planning. The author might have assumed they could make the decision alone, but in a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry, such a large expense should be discussed and agreed upon. The fact that the project is causing such a rift suggests that the author didn't consider the emotional and relational impact. So, while the author isn't breaking the law, their actions may be seen as inconsiderate in the context of their relationship. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is the asshole.\n"
