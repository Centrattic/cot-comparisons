Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for a while. They used this bonus to create a secret room in their house, which involved hiring a contractor, tearing down walls, and digging into the foundation. The house was inherited from their grandma, and they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it was irresponsible to use the bonus instead of paying off debt, helping with the wedding costs, or saving. The argument escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 moved in with her sister and might call off the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author's point: the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to use it for fun. The fianc\u00e9 argues that they should have discussed it as a couple since they're getting married, and the construction made living in the house impossible. The author insists it's their house.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The author used a bonus that was a one-time thing for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9 feels it was irresponsible and that they should have had a discussion about priorities. The author's action might be seen as not considering their partner's perspective, especially since they're planning to get married. Even though the author owns the house, making such a significant change without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9 could be a problem. The fact that the construction is making it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there adds to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, especially when planning to marry, financial decisions often require mutual agreement. Even if the author legally has the right to modify the house, the emotional and relational impact is significant. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and savings are valid. The author might have assumed they could make the decision alone, but in a committed relationship, major financial and structural decisions affecting both partners should be discussed. The fact that the author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the money was technically their own. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate properly and didn't consider their partner's financial priorities, which are important in a marriage. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The bonus was a one-time thing, so using it for a personal project isn't inherently wrong, but the lack of communication and the impact on the relationship are key factors here. So yes, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
