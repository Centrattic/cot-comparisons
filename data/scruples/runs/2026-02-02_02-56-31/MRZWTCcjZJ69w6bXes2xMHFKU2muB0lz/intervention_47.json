  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user is asking whether they're the asshole in the situation where they used their bonus to build a secret room, causing a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user got a five-figure bonus from a job after being out of work for a while. They decided to use this bonus to create a secret room in their house. The house is owned outright by the user, from their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinks it's irresponsible, and is considering ending the engagement. They've moved in with her sister.\n\nSo, the user argues the bonus was \"found money\" and they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 feels it should have been used for more practical purposes like paying debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. The user also mentions that it's their house, so they had the legal right to make the changes. However, the project has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, causing significant stress.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. The user has legal ownership of the house, so they can make modifications. But relationships involve shared responsibilities and expectations. Even if the money is technically the user's, the fianc\u00e9 is part of the partnership. The user didn't discuss the project with the fianc\u00e9 beforehand, which might have been a mistake. The bonus is a large sum, and while it's a windfall, using it for a personal project without considering the partner's financial goals or the impact on their living situation could be seen as selfish.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid too. Financial planning in a relationship often requires communication and compromise. The user's actions may have disregarded those needs, leading to a breakdown in the relationship. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering ending the engagement shows the severity of the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might not have anticipated how much the fianc\u00e9 would be affected. They saw the bonus as a one-time opportunity and wanted to use it for a personal dream. However, the impact on the relationship suggests that they should have considered their partner's input before proceeding.\n\nSo, am I the asshole? It seems like the user acted without considering their partner's feelings and financial priorities, leading to a major conflict. Even though they have legal rights to the house, the relational aspect is where they went wrong. The answer would likely be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the decision to proceed without discussion and the resulting harm to the relationship are significant.\n"
