  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a big fight with their fianc\u00e9. The key points here are their ownership of the house, the nature of the bonus, and the fianc\u00e9's reaction.\n\nFirst, the house was given to them by their grandmother, paid off, so they own it outright. That means they have legal authority to make changes. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't discuss the bonus money usage. The bonus was a one-time, five-figure amount, which the user sees as \"found money\" to be used for fun. The fianc\u00e9 argues it's irresponsible and that they should have used it for shared goals like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving.\n\nNow, the main issue is the communication. Even though the user has the right to use the money as they see fit, they didn't consult their fianc\u00e9. In a relationship, especially when planning a wedding, major financial decisions should be made together. The user's action might be seen as selfish because the house is a shared living space, and altering it without discussion affects both people. The fianc\u00e9 feeling that they can't live in the house anymore because of the construction shows a significant impact on their life, not just the user's. \n\nThe user's reasoning about the bonus being a one-time thing is valid, but the timing and lack of collaboration are problems. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that important decisions are being made without her input, which could lead to more issues in the future. The secret room being a personal desire versus joint financial priorities (debt, wedding, savings) is a conflict of values. While the user isn't technically in the wrong legally, in a relationship, mutual respect and communication are crucial. So, the answer is likely AITA A because the user didn't consider their partner's perspective and financial priorities despite the shared living situation and future plans.\n"
