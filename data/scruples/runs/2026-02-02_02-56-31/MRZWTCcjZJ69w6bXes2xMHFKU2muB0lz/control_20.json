Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who used a bonus to create a secret room in their shared house, causing a major conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a bonus after being unemployed for a while. They want to build a secret room in the house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the bonus should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to do what they want.\n\nHmm. The main issues here are financial responsibility and shared decision-making in a relationship. The author owns the house, so legally, they can make changes. But financially, bonuses are usually considered part of the couple's shared finances, especially since they're engaged and planning a wedding. The fianc\u00e9 feels that major expenses should be discussed together. The author's actions might have ignored the partner's financial priorities, leading to the breakdown of trust and communication.\n\nAlso, the project is causing inconvenience by making the house uninhabitable, which adds to the partner's frustration. Even if the author has the legal right, relationships require mutual agreement on significant financial decisions. The author might be seen as not respecting the partner's input and priorities, which is a key factor in whether they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, ethically in a relationship, big decisions affecting both partners, especially financial ones, should be discussed. The answer might be A (the author is the asshole) because they didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 properly, leading to serious consequences.\n"
