  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the user got a job after being out of work for years and received a bonus. They used it for a personal project\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house is theirs, legally owned, so they have the right to modify it. But their fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible. They argue the bonus was \"found money\" and they wanted to use it for something fun.\n\nNow, considering the key points: They own the house, so legally, they can do what they want. But this is a relationship issue. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without discussion, leading to her moving out and considering breaking off the wedding. Even though the money was a bonus, in a committed relationship, major financial decisions usually require communication. The user might have overlooked the partner's feelings and priorities. The project caused practical issues too, making the house uninhabitable for her. \n\nSo while the user isn't legally wrong, the social and relational aspects are important. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) angle often looks at how considerate one is of others, especially a partner. The user didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 on how to use the bonus, which is a shared life decision. Even if the money is their own, the impact on the relationship and the partner's stress about debt or wedding costs matters. The answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the relationship's dynamics.\n"
