  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through their story again carefully.\n\nThey got a good job after being out of steady work for a while. Received a five-figure bonus in late February. Always wanted a secret room with a bookshelf door and a circular staircase to a new basement. They hired a contractor, started tearing walls and digging the foundation. The house is owned outright by them, given by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is furious, says using the bonus was irresponsible, they could have used the money for debt, wedding costs, or savings. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's impossible to live in the house now, and the relationship is in jeopardy. The question is whether the person is the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, the key points here are financial responsibility, communication in a relationship, and respect for shared decisions. The person argues that the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to have fun with it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't discuss it and now the house is under construction, making living there impossible.\n\nLegally, they own the house, so they have the right to make modifications. However, in a relationship, especially when engaged, major financial decisions typically require mutual agreement. Even if the bonus was unexpected, using such a large sum for a personal project without consulting the fianc\u00e9 could be seen as a breach of trust. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and savings are valid financial priorities. The fact that the project has made living in the house difficult adds to the stress and practical issues.\n\nThe person might not see it as wrong because they own the house and the bonus was their income. But relationships often require considering each other's perspectives and planning together. Not discussing a major expense, especially one that affects the entire household and their future together, can be a significant oversight. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be strong because of the lack of communication and the impact on their shared life.\n\nSo, considering the relationship context, even if legally they have the right to make the changes, the social and relational expectations might mean that they are in the wrong for not involving their fianc\u00e9 in the decision. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (they are the asshole). But there's also the argument that the bonus was a one-time event and they wanted to enjoy it, which could be seen as reasonable. However, the key issue is the lack of discussion and the consequences on their relationship. So probably A.\n"
