Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They wanted to build a secret room, hired a contractor, and started renovating. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they might break up. The house is owned by the author, so legally they can do what they want. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint decision since they're getting married.\n\nThe author argues the bonus is \"found money\" and they wanted to use it for fun. The fianc\u00e9 thinks they should have discussed it and used the money for more practical things like debt or the wedding. The renovation is making the house uninhabitable for her, leading her to move out.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, even though the house is theirs, a major renovation that affects the living situation of a fianc\u00e9 without discussion might be an issue. Financial decisions, especially large ones, in a relationship usually require communication. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which could be seen as dismissive. Even if the money is theirs, the impact on the relationship is significant. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs are valid, and ignoring them might be selfish. However, the author's right to their own property is a point. But since they're engaged, financial planning together is expected. So the author's mistake was not discussing the bonus usage with their fianc\u00e9, leading to a major conflict. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
