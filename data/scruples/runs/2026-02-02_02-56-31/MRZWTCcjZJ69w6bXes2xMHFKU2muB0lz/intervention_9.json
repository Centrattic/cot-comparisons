  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The user got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it for a personal project, a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married. She wants the money to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The user argues it's their house and the bonus is \"found money\" they might not get again. The argument escalated to the point where she moved out and they're considering breaking up.\n\nNow, considering the user's side: they own the house outright, inherited it from their grandma. The bonus is their personal income, so legally, they can spend it as they like. The project is their dream, and they had the contractor start work. They might feel entitled to use their own money for personal desires.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's perspective: they're engaged, so merging finances is a big step. She's concerned about financial responsibility, using the bonus for shared goals like paying debt or reducing pressure on her parents for the wedding. The project's scope (digging foundation, tearing walls) might have disrupted their shared living space, making it hard for her to live there. Moving out indicates significant distress and feeling unheard.\n\nEthically, while the user has the legal right to spend their bonus, in a committed relationship, major financial decisions should involve discussion. Even though the bonus is personal, the project affects the entire house and their future together. Using a large sum without considering the partner's input can lead to resentment. The user's insistence on \"it's my house\" might overlook the shared nature of their relationship and future marriage.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It's a mix. Legally, no. Ethically, maybe. The key issue is communication. The user didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making a major financial and structural decision that impacts their relationship. Even if the bonus is their own, the project's scale and its effect on their shared life should have been discussed. The fianc\u00e9's reaction shows that this wasn't just about money but about respect for each other's priorities and shared future.\n\nTherefore, the user might be at fault for not involving their partner in the decision, even if the money is theirs. Relationships require compromise, especially when it comes to shared assets and future plans. The answer would likely be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the decision caused major conflict without mutual agreement.\n"
