Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author received a one-time bonus after a long period of being unemployed. They used this money to fund a personal project\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement. The house is owned outright by the author (inherited from their grandma), so they have legal right to modify it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling that the bonus should have been used for more practical purposes like debt, wedding expenses, or savings. The conflict has escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 is considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author's stance is that the bonus was unexpected and possibly a one-time opportunity, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 argues for financial responsibility, given they're planning to get married. The author's actions have made the house uninhabitable temporarily, leading the fianc\u00e9 to move out.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, while they legally own the house, relationships involve compromise. Even though the bonus is personal, major home renovations without discussing it with a partner, especially when planning to marry, can be seen as dismissive of shared financial planning. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a significant decision that affects their shared living space. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering ending the engagement suggests a serious breach of trust or communication. The author's argument that it's their house might be valid legally, but in a committed relationship, major financial decisions should involve both partners. The secret room idea, while personal, may not have considered the fianc\u00e9's priorities and the practical aspects of their future together. So, the author's actions, while not illegal, likely overlooked the importance of mutual planning in a marriage, making them at least partially responsible for the conflict.\n"
