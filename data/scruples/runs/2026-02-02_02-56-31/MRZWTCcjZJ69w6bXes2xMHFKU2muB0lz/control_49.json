Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of work for a while, received a five-figure bonus, and used it to build a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement. They own the house outright, inherited from their grandma. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they might break up over it.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is wrong. The key points are: the bonus was a one-time thing, they own the house, but their fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't discuss it beforehand. The author argues it's their house and the bonus is \"found money,\" while the fianc\u00e9e feels it's a joint decision, especially since they're getting married.\n\nHmm. Even though the author owns the house, when you're engaged and planning to marry, major financial decisions affecting shared living spaces should be discussed. The secret room project might have significant costs that impact their financial plans, like paying off debt or wedding expenses. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which could be seen as dismissive of her concerns. Plus, tearing up the house might affect the property they're both going to live in. So while the author has the right to modify their own property, not involving their partner in a major financial decision, especially when it affects their future together, could be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is valid here. So the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and considered their partner's input.\n"
