Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus from a job they just landed after being out of steady work. They used this bonus to build a secret room, which involves significant construction. The house is owned outright by the author, as it was given by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the money should have been used for shared goals like paying debt, wedding costs, or saving. She's so upset she moved out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nNow, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, since the author owns the house, they have the right to modify it. The bonus is their income, and they might see it as \"found money\" from a good year at work. However, relationships involve shared decision-making. Even though the house is the author's, a fianc\u00e9 might expect discussions about major projects that affect both partners, especially when significant money is involved. The construction is causing the fianc\u00e9 to not be able to live in the house, which is a big deal. The fact that this is leading to the engagement being called off suggests the decision had a major impact without considering the partner's feelings and needs.\n\nFinancial responsibility is also a factor. The author chose to spend a bonus on a personal project instead of shared financial goals. While the bonus is a one-time windfall, the fianc\u00e9 argues it could have been used more responsibly. The author's stance that it's their house and their money might overlook the collaborative nature of a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry.\n\nSo, the question is about balance between personal desires and shared responsibilities. The author's actions, while legally justified, may ignore the emotional and relational aspects. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because major financial decisions in a relationship should involve mutual agreement. The secret room project's impact on their living situation and the wedding plans adds to the severity of the issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the plan with their fianc\u00e9 and prioritizing a personal project over shared goals, leading to significant relationship strain.\n"
