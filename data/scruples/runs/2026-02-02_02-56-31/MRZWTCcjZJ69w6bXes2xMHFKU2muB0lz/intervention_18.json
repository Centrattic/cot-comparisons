  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person in question used their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9. The key points here are the financial decision, the use of the bonus, the impact on their relationship, and the communication between the two.\n\nFirst, the bonus is described as \"found money\" that might not come again. The person argues they have the right to spend it as they wish, especially since they own the house outright. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels it was irresponsible and that the money could have been better used for shared goals like paying off debt or the wedding. This points to a conflict in priorities and financial planning.\n\nThe fact that the project is causing such a significant disruption in the house and leading the fianc\u00e9 to move out suggests that the decision wasn't made with enough consideration for her feelings or their shared future. Even though the house is owned by the person, major renovations that affect the entire living space could reasonably require discussion with a fianc\u00e9, especially when it's causing stress and potential relationship breakdown.\n\nThe main issue seems to be the lack of communication and mutual decision-making. While the bonus is technically the person's money, relationships often involve shared financial responsibilities and goals. Using a large sum for a personal project without discussing it with a fianc\u00e9 can be seen as dismissive of their concerns and priorities. The fianc\u00e9's reaction, while intense, highlights the importance of considering each other's needs in a partnership.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the person might be in the wrong not because they spent the money, but because they didn't involve their fianc\u00e9 in the decision-making process. Major financial decisions, even with one's own money, can have shared implications, especially in a committed relationship nearing marriage. The fact that this led to such a severe conflict suggests that the person didn't adequately address their fianc\u00e9's concerns, which is a key factor in determining if they're the asshole here.\n"
