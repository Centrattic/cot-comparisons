Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author got a big bonus after landing a good job and decided to use it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and wants to call off the wedding. The author owns the house outright because it was given to them by their grandmother, so they have legal authority to make changes. \n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is that the bonus was unexpected and might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 argues that using the money could have helped with debts, wedding costs, or savings, and that the construction is making it hard to live in the house. \n\nHmm, the author did mention that they haven't discussed this with their fianc\u00e9. Even though they own the house, relationships involve compromise. The fianc\u00e9 is feeling left out of financial decisions, especially since they're getting married. The author's actions might have caused significant stress and disruption, leading to the fianc\u00e9 moving out. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in debt and the house is their own. They have the right to use their bonus as they see fit. But relationships require communication and mutual agreement on big expenses, especially when planning to marry. The secret project might have been a personal dream, but it's important to consider the partner's perspective. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but they could have communicated better. However, the fact that this decision caused such a major rift might mean they did overlook their partner's concerns. The fianc\u00e9's arguments about financial responsibility and the disruption are valid. \n\nI think the key points are the lack of communication and the impact on their relationship. Even though the author had the right to spend the money, not discussing it with their fianc\u00e9 shows a lack of consideration. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't involve their partner in the decision, leading to serious consequences.\n"
