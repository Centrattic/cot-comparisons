  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the key points: They got a job after being out of steady work, received a five-figure bonus. Used that bonus to build a secret room, which involved significant construction. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they're now considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nThe user owns the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want with their property. The bonus was unexpected, so maybe they saw it as a windfall. But the fianc\u00e9 feels like this decision wasn't discussed, and the construction is making the house uninhabitable. The relationship is now in jeopardy.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLegally, they're in the right since it's their house and their bonus. But relationships require communication and mutual agreement. Even if the money is theirs, major projects that affect shared living spaces should be discussed, especially when planning to marry. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the money for debts or the wedding, and the disruption from construction, are valid points. The user's decision to go ahead without discussion might have been a mistake from a relational standpoint, even if legally correct. \n\nSo, while the user isn't legally wrong, the social and emotional context might make them the asshole. Relationships often require compromise and communication. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering ending the engagement suggests that the user's actions were a major oversight in terms of partnership. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
