  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user got a five-figure bonus and decided to use it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The user argues it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing.\n\nFirst, the user owns the house outright, so legally they have the right to modify it. But relationships involve compromise. Even though it's their house, major renovations without discussing with a partner can be a problem. The fianc\u00e9 feels her concerns were ignored, leading to her moving out and considering ending the engagement. \n\nThe bonus was unexpected, but using it for a personal project might not consider shared financial goals. The user didn't consult the fianc\u00e9, which is a key issue in relationships. Financial decisions, especially large ones, should involve both partners. Disregarding her input caused significant conflict. \n\nWhile the user's desire for a secret room is a personal dream, the way it was executed without discussion might have been inconsiderate. The result is a major rift. So, even if legally they're right, emotionally and relationally, they might have been in the wrong by not involving their fianc\u00e9 in the decision.\n"
