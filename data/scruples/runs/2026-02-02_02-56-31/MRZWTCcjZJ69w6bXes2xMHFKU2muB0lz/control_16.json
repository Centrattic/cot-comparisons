Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9. The author got a job after being out of work for a while, received a five-figure bonus, and decided to use it for this project. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married. She wants the money used for paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to do what they want.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has legal ownership of the house, so they technically have the right to modify it. The bonus is seen as extra money, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it's necessary for their future together. Marriage usually involves shared financial decisions, so maybe the author didn't consult her properly. Even though it's their house, major renovations could affect both partners, especially if they're planning to live there together. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement because of this is a big red flag. The author might not have considered her perspective and the impact on their relationship. While the project is a personal dream, relationships often require compromise. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not discussing the decision with their fianc\u00e9 first, especially given their impending marriage.\n"
