  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the user got a significant bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it for a personal project they wanted\u2014a secret room. The house is theirs, owned outright from their grandma, so legally they can do what they want. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels the money could have been used for shared goals like paying off debt or the wedding. The user argues it's \"found money\" and their house, but the project is causing them to leave and possibly end the engagement.\n\nHmm. The key points are about financial responsibility in a relationship. Even though the user has the legal right to spend their bonus, relationships often require compromise. The fianc\u00e9 feels her needs and the couple's shared financial goals were ignored. The user didn't consult her before making a big decision that affects their shared living space. Even if it's their house, since they're engaged, major financial decisions might need discussion. The fact that the project is making the fianc\u00e9 unable to live there now adds to the problem. The user's insistence that it's their house and their money might not consider the emotional and relational impact. So, while the user isn't legally wrong, relationally, they might have been in the wrong for not communicating and considering their partner's perspective. That leans towards answer A.\n"
