Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which involved significant construction. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and that they should have discussed it. The house is owned by the author, so legally they can do what they want. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint decision since they're getting married.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility and communication. The author argues the bonus is \"found money\" and wanted to use it for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's a shared responsibility and that they should have planned for future expenses like the wedding and debt. \n\nLegally, the author has the right to use their bonus as they see fit. But in a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry, financial decisions that impact both partners should probably be discussed. The construction also made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, adding to the tension. \n\nThe fact that they're engaged means they're likely planning to combine finances eventually. Not discussing such a large expense could be seen as selfish. Even though the bonus is the author's money, major projects affecting the home and their future together should involve mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but her concerns about debt, wedding costs, and the living situation are valid points. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might have failed to communicate and consider their partner's perspective. Relationships require compromise, and using a significant amount of money without discussion can cause trust issues. The author's insistence on doing it their way without considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings and practical concerns could make them the asshole here. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly and didn't consider the financial implications for their future together, even if they had the legal right to use their bonus.\n"
