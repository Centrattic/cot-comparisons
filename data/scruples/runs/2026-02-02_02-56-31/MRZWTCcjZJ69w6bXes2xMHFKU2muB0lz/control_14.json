Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author got a job and received a five-figure bonus. They wanted to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright since it was given to them by their grandma. They hired a contractor to do the work, but their fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't discuss the use of the bonus money. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is considering breaking off the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and they wanted to use it for a personal project. They also mention that the house is theirs, so they have the legal right to make changes. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that this wasn't discussed and that the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or helping with the wedding expenses.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are wrong. Legally, since the author owns the house, they can make structural changes. But in a relationship, especially with a fianc\u00e9, financial decisions can be a shared responsibility. Even though the bonus is the author's income, big financial decisions usually involve communication. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9, which led to a major conflict. The fianc\u00e9 is feeling that their input was disregarded, which is a valid concern in a relationship. The fact that the project caused the fianc\u00e9 to move out and consider ending the relationship shows the severity of the issue.\n\nSo, while the author might not be legally wrong, in terms of relationship responsibilities, they might have a point in not discussing the use of the bonus. Financial decisions, even if it's their own money, can affect the relationship. The author's actions led to significant distress and the potential end of the engagement. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering their fianc\u00e9's perspective and not discussing the project beforehand.\n"
