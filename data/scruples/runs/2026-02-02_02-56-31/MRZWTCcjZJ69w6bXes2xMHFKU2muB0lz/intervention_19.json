  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they took their bonus money to build a secret room in their house, which is causing a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the person owns the house outright because they inherited it from their grandma. That means they have legal authority to make changes. The bonus was unexpected, and they decided to use it for this project. They argue it's their money and their house, so they can do what they want. But their fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't discuss it, and now she's considering calling off the wedding.\n\nHmm. Even though they own the house, relationships often require communication and mutual decision-making, especially when major changes affect the shared living space. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that important financial decisions should be made together, especially since they're planning to get married. The fact that she's now living in the house and the construction is making it hard for her to stay could add to the tension. \n\nAlso, the bonus being a one-time thing is a point they bring up, but if they're getting married, combining finances is usually part of the process. The person might have assumed they can spend the bonus as they wish, but in a committed relationship, expecting to make big decisions without input can lead to issues. \n\nSo, while legally they can make the changes, emotionally and relationally, not discussing it with their fianc\u00e9 could be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and shared financial planning might be valid. The surprise of the project and the significant changes to the house could be a major stressor for her. \n\nTherefore, even if the person isn't technically wrong, the way they handled the situation without considering their partner's feelings and the shared future might make them the asshole here. The key points are lack of communication and not considering the impact on the relationship.\n"
