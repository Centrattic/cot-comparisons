Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a bonus being used for a secret room, leading to a conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The person got a five-figure bonus after a long period of unemployment. They decided to use it for a secret room, which their fianc\u00e9 is upset about. The fianc\u00e9 argues that the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The person counters that it's their house and the bonus is \"found money\" that might not come again.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics here. The person owns the house outright, so legally, they can make changes. However, the relationship aspect is crucial. The fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding because of this. The main issue seems to be a disagreement over financial priorities and communication.\n\nThe person used the bonus without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9. Even though it's their money, big financial decisions in a relationship, especially when planning to get married, usually require mutual agreement. The fact that the project has already started, making it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there, adds to the tension. Moving in with her sister is a significant consequence.\n\nOn one hand, the person has the right to spend their bonus as they see fit. On the other hand, not consulting their fianc\u00e9 on such a major project, especially when it affects the entire house and their future together, could be seen as inconsiderate. Financial decisions in a committed relationship often involve shared responsibility, even if the funds are separate. The surprise nature of the project might have been a key factor in the fianc\u00e9's reaction.\n\nSo, while the person isn't legally wrong, the social and relational expectations might place some responsibility on them. The answer likely hinges on whether the action of spending the bonus without discussion was a breach of trust or partnership. Since the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement, it's a serious issue. The author may be in the wrong for not involving their partner in such a significant financial decision, even if it's their own money.\n"
