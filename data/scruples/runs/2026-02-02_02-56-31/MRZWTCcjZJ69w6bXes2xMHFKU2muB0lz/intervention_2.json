  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for using their bonus to create a secret room with a bookshelf door. They got the bonus after being out of work for a while, own the house, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset.\n\nFirst, they own the house outright, so legally they can do what they want. The bonus was a one-time thing, so they see it as \"found money.\" But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and wants to use the money for debt, wedding, or savings. They didn't discuss it before spending, which is probably the main issue here. The project has made the house hard to live in, leading to her moving out and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nEven though legally it's their house, relationships require communication and compromise. Not discussing big expenses that affect the living space and the shared future (like a wedding) could be seen as selfish. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs are valid because they are financial obligations. The user's defense about using the bonus for a personal project without considering the partner's input might make them the asshole here. So, answer A.\n"
