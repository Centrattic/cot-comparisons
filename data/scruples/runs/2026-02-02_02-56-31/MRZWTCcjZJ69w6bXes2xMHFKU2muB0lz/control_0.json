Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person got a bonus after being out of work for a while and decided to use it to build a secret room in their house. They own the house outright since it was their grandma's. Their fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't discuss it and now she can't live there anymore. She's thinking of breaking off the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author used their own bonus money, which they consider \"found money.\" They didn't take from shared finances, right? But the problem is the project itself. They hired a contractor to tear down walls and dig into the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is furious because they could have used the money for other things like paying off debt, the wedding, etc. Also, the construction is making the house uninhabitable for her.\n\nThe author argues it's their house, but they're engaged. Maybe there's an expectation of joint decision-making even if it's their property. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset she left and is considering ending the marriage is a big deal. The author didn't consult her, which is a key point. Even if the money is separate, the project is affecting their shared living situation. Maybe the author is being selfish despite using their own money. Also, the project's impact on the house might affect both of them, even if it's the author's property. The fianc\u00e9 might feel her needs are being ignored, especially since they're planning to marry. \n\nSo, even though the author has the legal right to modify the house, the relationship aspect is crucial here. Not discussing a major financial decision with a fianc\u00e9, especially one that affects the living situation, could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards AITA being the author because they didn't involve their partner in the decision, leading to significant conflict and potential breakup. The key is that while the money is theirs, the decision has major implications on the relationship. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering their fianc\u00e9's feelings and the shared life they're building.\n"
