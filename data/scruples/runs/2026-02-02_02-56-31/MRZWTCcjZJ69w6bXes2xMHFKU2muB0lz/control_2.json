Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which involved significant structural changes. The house is owned outright by the author, so legally they have the right to modify it. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they expected the bonus to be used for other purposes like paying off debt, wedding costs, or saving. She's so upset she moved out and is considering ending the engagement.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a relationship, especially a fianc\u00e9 situation. Financial decisions can be a big deal. Even if the house is the author's, a fianc\u00e9 might expect shared financial planning. The author argues the bonus was \"found money,\" but the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible not to discuss major expenses. The fact that the project made the house uninhabitable for her is another issue. The author didn't consult her before making changes, which could be seen as dismissive of her needs and the relationship's future.\n\nLegally, the author might have the right to modify their property, but relationships involve more than legalities. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is about shared responsibilities and planning for the marriage. The author's unilateral decision might have ignored her concerns, leading to the conflict. The fact that she's moved out and they're considering breaking up shows the severity of the issue from her side. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on relationship norms. While they had the right to spend their bonus, not discussing it with their fianc\u00e9, especially for such a significant project that affects living conditions, could be seen as a mistake. The fianc\u00e9's feelings are valid because major financial decisions should be mutual in a committed relationship. The author might not be legally wrong, but relationally, they may have acted inconsiderately, leading to the fallout. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective and the impact on their relationship.\n"
