  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the user got a job after being out of work for years and received a five-figure bonus. They wanted to build a secret room, hired a contractor, and started the project. The house is owned outright by the user, as it was given by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and wants the money used for debts, wedding costs, or savings. The user argues it's \"found money\" and their house, leading to the fianc\u00e9 moving out and possible breakup.\n\nSo, the main points: Legal ownership of the house means the user has the right to modify it. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and they didn't discuss it. The bonus might have been a one-time thing, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it's necessary for shared financial goals.\n\nThe user's actions are legal, but the issue is more about relationship dynamics and communication. Even though the user owns the house, big financial decisions in a relationship often require mutual discussion. The fianc\u00e9 feels excluded and possibly disrespected, leading to severe consequences. The user didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective and needs, which could be seen as selfish, even if legally they're not wrong. The fact that the project caused the house to be uninhabitable adds to the problem.\n\nSo, while legally the user isn't wrong, relationally they might be. The question is whether using the bonus without discussion is the problem. Since it's a shared life and future marriage, financial decisions should be mutual. The answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and considered their partner's needs.\n"
