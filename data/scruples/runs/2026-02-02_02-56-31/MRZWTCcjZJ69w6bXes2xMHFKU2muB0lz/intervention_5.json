  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user got a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house, which is owned by them. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding, and the construction is making living at home difficult.\n\nFirst, the user owns the house outright, so they have the legal right to modify it. The bonus was a one-time thing, and they considered it \"found money.\" But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible. Since they're engaged and planning to get married, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, even if the money is the user's own. The user didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before spending the bonus on this project, which led to a significant conflict. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement shows how serious the issue is. Even though the user had the right to use their money, not discussing such a big decision with a partner in a committed relationship might have been a mistake. So, maybe the user is partially in the wrong for not considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective and the impact on their shared future plans. \n\nBut on the other hand, the user had the right to spend their own bonus as they saw fit. The key issue here is communication and shared financial planning in a relationship. The user might not be the asshole, but the situation shows a breakdown in communication and considering the partner's feelings. The answer might depend on whether using personal funds for a personal project without discussing it with a fianc\u00e9 is considered wrong in the context of a committed relationship. There's a balance between individual freedom and shared responsibility when planning to marry.\n"
