  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for taking my bonus and creating a \"secret\" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)?\nHello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user (AITA) got a big bonus after being unemployed for a while. They wanted to create a secret room in their house, which they own. They hired a contractor and started major renovations. The fianc\u00e9e is furious, thinks it's irresponsible, and they might break up.\n\nFirst, the house is owned by the user, so legally, they have the right to modify it. But relationships involve more than just legal rights. The bonus was a one-time thing, which the user sees as \"found money,\" but the fianc\u00e9e believes in using it for practical purposes like debt, wedding costs, or savings. \n\nThe user didn't discuss this with the fianc\u00e9e beforehand, which is a key point. Even if they own the house, major renovations affecting the entire house (like digging up the foundation, tearing walls) would impact their shared living space. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests she felt excluded from the decision-making process. \n\nIn relationships, especially when planning to marry, financial decisions should be mutual. The user's actions might have disregarded the fianc\u00e9e's financial priorities and made her feel disrespected. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e now can't live in the house because of the construction adds to the stress. \n\nWhile the user's intent was to have a fun project, the execution lacked communication and consideration. Even if the bonus was a one-time event, the fianc\u00e9e's concerns about responsibility and shared future are valid. The user's stance that \"it's my house\" might be seen as prioritizing personal desires over partnership.\n\nSo, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't include their partner in the decision, leading to significant conflict. The answer is likely A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
