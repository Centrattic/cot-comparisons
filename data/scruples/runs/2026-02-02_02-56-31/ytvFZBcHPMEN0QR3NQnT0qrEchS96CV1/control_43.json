He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met a guy at art school, they became friends, developed a romantic relationship, and were about to have sex when the author discovered the guy is trans. The author feels the guy didn't disclose this information earlier, which made the author lose attraction because they're strictly straight. The trans guy is upset and called the author names. The author is now questioning if they're in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy didn't tell the author he's trans until just before they had sex. The author now feels like it was a lie and that the guy withheld important information. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded after finding out. The guy is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they felt misled because the guy didn't disclose his trans status earlier. They might have thought they were seeing a cisgender male, which is important for their attraction. The author wasn't attracted to a vagina and now feels the guy didn't tell them in time for them to make an informed choice. The author is trying to remain friends but the guy is angry, leading the author to question their actions.\n\nFrom the trans guy's side, he might have chosen to share his trans status when he felt comfortable. It's possible he was waiting for the right time or didn't want to bring it up early in the relationship. However, if the author is strictly straight, the guy's not disclosing could be seen as withholding important information that affects the relationship's future.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The author isn't being malicious; they're stating their preferences. It's possible that the guy didn't disclose because he feared rejection or was still figuring out his identity. On the other hand, if the author is clear about being straight, then the guy might have a responsibility to share that information earlier to avoid a misunderstanding.\n\nBut relationships can be complex. People don't always disclose everything upfront, especially if they're not sure how the other person will react. The author might have felt the guy lied, but the guy might have had reasons for not sharing. However, the author's right to their preferences is valid. They can't be forced to be in a relationship if their attraction isn't there.\n\nThe trans guy's reaction of calling the author names might be more in the wrong, especially if he accused them of faking friendship. That could be emotionally abusive. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because their attraction is a personal choice. The issue might be more about the guy not disclosing, but the author's stance isn't malicious. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
