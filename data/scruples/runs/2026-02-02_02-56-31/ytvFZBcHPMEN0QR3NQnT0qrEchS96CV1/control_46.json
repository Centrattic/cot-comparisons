He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author met someone at art school, became friends, and it turned into a romantic relationship. The key point here is that the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity until they were about to have sex. The author then stopped and felt lied to because they consider themselves straight and aren't attracted to vaginas. The trans person is upset and called the author names like evil and manipulative.\n\nSo, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The author's main issue is that they didn't know the person was trans until that intimate moment. They feel the person didn't disclose important information that affected the author's feelings. The author isn't being offensive for being straight, right? It's their preference. They also wanted to stay friends but the other person is angry.\n\nThe trans person's perspective is that it's hard to be who they are, but they didn't disclose earlier. The author felt lied to because the person didn't tell them when they were building the relationship. The author's reaction is about personal attraction, not about the person's identity itself. So, the author isn't rejecting the person for who they are, but a specific aspect of their body that affects the author's preferences.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is the author wrong for not continuing the relationship? I don't think so. People have different boundaries and attraction is subjective. The author isn't obligated to change their preferences. The trans person didn't lie if they didn't realize the author didn't know, but if the author felt it was important to know earlier, maybe the trans person should have mentioned it. However, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The trans person's anger seems misplaced. The author isn't an asshole for being honest about their preferences. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
