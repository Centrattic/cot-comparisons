He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author met someone at art school, developed a friendship, and then a romantic relationship. They started dating, had physical intimacy, and during a moment where they were about to have sex, the author discovered that their crush is trans. The key point here is that the author wasn't attracted to them anymore after this discovery. The author feels like they were lied to because the trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier. The trans person is upset and called the author names, leading to a conflict about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the trans person's perspective. Transitioning or being trans is a personal journey. If the trans person had disclosed their identity earlier, maybe the author could have decided if they were okay with that. However, the author also mentions that they were strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. So, the author's lack of attraction is a personal preference, not a judgment or hatred.\n\nNow, was there a lie? If the trans person didn't present as male to the author before they got into a physical relationship, maybe there's a miscommunication. But if they had transitioned and lived as their true gender, they might not have felt the need to disclose medical details unless it was relevant. For example, if they pass as male but don't mention their trans status, the author might not have known. The author found out during a sexual encounter, which could be seen as a breach of trust if disclosure was expected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about their attractions. They aren't trying to be offensive, just stating their personal preferences. The author's reaction is based on their own feelings and not on any malice towards the trans person. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not accepted, which is a real emotional response. But the author isn't obligated to be in a relationship if they aren't attracted to someone, even after knowing their trans status.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after finding out. The author did stop the encounter and had a conversation, showing they considered the trans person's feelings. The author also wants to remain friends. The trans person's anger and accusations of being evil or manipulative might be an overreaction, but it's a valid emotional response given the situation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for having personal boundaries about their attractions. They didn't hide their preferences until now, but they were unaware of the trans person's identity. The trans person might have had the opportunity to disclose their status earlier, which they didn't, leading to the author's surprise. However, whether they were obligated to disclose is a tricky point. If the trans person is living openly as their gender and the author didn't know, the author isn't at fault for not knowing.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are honest about their preferences, acted based on the information they had, and didn't force the relationship. The trans person's upset is understandable, but the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
