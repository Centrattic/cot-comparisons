He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author developed a romantic relationship with someone they met at art school. They became close, had a lot in common, and started dating. During a moment when things were getting intimate, the author discovered that their partner is trans, specifically that they have a vagina. The author then felt like they were lied to because the partner didn't disclose this earlier. They stop the relationship, and the partner becomes angry, calling the author names. The author is now questioning if they're the asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was in the wrong. The key points here are about honesty in relationships and personal boundaries. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is a personal preference. The trans person didn't disclose their status early on, and the author feels misled. But the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI should think about the timeline. The author and their partner were friends for months and developed a romantic relationship. The trans person didn't mention their identity until the moment of intimacy. The author's reaction is based on not being attracted to them due to their gender identity. The author also mentions that if the partner had told them earlier, maybe they could have worked through it, but since it came up during a sexual encounter, they felt it was too late. \n\nNow, the trans person's perspective is important. They might have felt it was a private matter or were waiting for the right time. However, in a romantic relationship, certain personal details like gender identity are typically considered important to share before becoming physically intimate. The author's feeling of being lied to is valid if the partner didn't disclose this information when appropriate. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious; they're stating their personal preference and boundaries. It's not about being offensive but about not being attracted to someone once they know certain things. The partner's anger and accusations might stem from feeling rejected or hurt, but that doesn't make the author wrong for ending the relationship. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author didn't know the partner was trans until that moment, which could be seen as a lack of communication from the partner. The author is honest about their feelings and isn't forcing a relationship. They also want to remain friends, which shows they're not being cruel. \n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, some might argue that the author is being close-minded for not overcoming their attraction based on the partner's identity. But others might say it's their right to have personal preferences. The key is whether the author acted in bad faith. They didn't hide their sexuality; they came to terms with it during the relationship. The partner's timing of disclosure might be at fault here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're being honest about their feelings and boundaries. The partner's actions might be the issue for not disclosing earlier. The author's reaction is a result of their personal preferences and the late disclosure. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
