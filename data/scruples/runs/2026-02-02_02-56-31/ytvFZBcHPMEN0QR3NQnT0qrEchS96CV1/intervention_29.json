  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They met someone at art school, became friends, developed a romantic relationship, and were about to have sex when the user realized their crush was trans. The user felt lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. Now, the user isn't attracted anymore and wants to stay friends, but the other person is upset and called them names. The user is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are attraction, disclosure, and whether the user's reaction is justified. The user is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the situation is about how they felt when they discovered the trans identity. The key issue is whether the trans person withheld information that the user considers important for the relationship. The user feels lied to because the person didn't come out earlier, which led to the user losing attraction and ending the relationship. The other person is upset and accused the user of being manipulative.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and ethics. Trans people have the right to their identity, but there's also the expectation of honesty in a relationship. However, when is the right time to disclose such information? In many cases, people might disclose their gender identity when they feel comfortable, but if it's a significant factor for the other person, not disclosing early could lead to issues. However, the user is facing their own biases here\u2014being strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. \n\nBut the user is asking if they're in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the user's reaction is fair. The user isn't in the wrong for their feelings of attraction, as attraction is personal. However, the user might be in the wrong if they treated the trans person disrespectfully. In the scenario, the user tried to stop the situation and wanted to remain friends. The trans person, on the other hand, might have been dishonest by not disclosing earlier, which is a different issue. \n\nSo, the user's main action is ending the relationship due to loss of attraction after the disclosure. Since attraction is subjective, the user isn't in the wrong for not being attracted. However, the user might have a responsibility to communicate their boundaries earlier if they knew about the trans identity upfront. But in this case, the user didn't know earlier, so it's a situation where the trans person's disclosure timing is in question. \n\nBut the user isn't the one who withheld information. The trans person didn't tell them, so the user's reaction is based on a situation that wasn't their fault. However, the user's attraction is influenced by their own preferences, which are valid. So, the answer is B (No, the user isn't in the wrong). The user's actions are based on personal feelings and the lack of disclosure from the other person. The trans person's anger towards the user might stem from their own feelings of rejection, but the user isn't at fault here.\n"
