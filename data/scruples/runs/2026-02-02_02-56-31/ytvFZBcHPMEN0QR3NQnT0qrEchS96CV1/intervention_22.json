He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. They were dating, but when they realized he's trans, their attraction faded. The key points here are about honesty, communication, and personal preferences.\n\nFirst, the user feels like they were lied to because the crush didn't disclose being trans earlier. They mention it's important to them because they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The crush didn't come out before the relationship became physical, which made the user uncomfortable. \n\nNow, the user is asking if they're an asshole for not wanting to continue the relationship. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). From what I understand, people have the right to their own preferences. Being straight means being attracted to the opposite sex, so if the person identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, then it's their personal choice. However, the main issue here is the lack of communication from the crush. The user didn't know until a very intimate moment, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe user isn't trying to hurt the crush, but they're honest about their feelings. The crush is upset and is lashing out, calling the user names, which might be due to their own feelings of rejection. The user is trying to maintain a friendship while being clear about not wanting a romantic relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't in the wrong for having their own preferences. The crush should have been honest from the beginning if the user's orientation is a deal-breaker. The user's response is about their genuine feelings, not being manipulative. So the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
