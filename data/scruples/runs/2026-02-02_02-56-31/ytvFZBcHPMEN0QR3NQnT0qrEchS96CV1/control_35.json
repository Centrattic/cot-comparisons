He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their crush is transgender and their attraction diminished, leading to a breakup. The author is wondering if they're an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man in question is trans, and the author discovered this during a moment of intimacy. The author mentions they were dating, so there was a romantic relationship. The author feels lied to because the trans man didn't disclose this earlier. However, the author also states that the man had months to tell them and that he only revealed it when they were about to have sex.\n\nThe author is straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so the trans man's status affects their attraction. The author wants to remain friends but the trans man is upset and called them names. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should think about the ethics of disclosure. Trans people often disclose their gender identity when they feel ready, especially in a romantic context. However, the author felt misled because it was revealed during a sexual encounter. The author's reaction is based on their personal attraction preferences, which are valid. They're not being cruel; they're stating their feelings honestly. \n\nThe trans man's reaction is intense\u2014he called the author evil and manipulative. That seems harsh, especially since the author is expressing their feelings and boundaries. The author isn't attacking the man's identity; they're acknowledging the situation but stating they can't proceed romantically. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're honest about their feelings and not pretending to be attracted when they're not. They want to maintain a friendship, which shows they care about the relationship beyond romance. The trans man's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not being accepted, but the author isn't rejecting his identity\u2014they're rejecting a romantic relationship based on their own preferences. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. Their response is about personal preference and honesty in a relationship. They're not avoiding the issue but addressing it directly. The trans man's hurt feelings are understandable, but the author isn't obligated to be in a relationship they aren't attracted to. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
