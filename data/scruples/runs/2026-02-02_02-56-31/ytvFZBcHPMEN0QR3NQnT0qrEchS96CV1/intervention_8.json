He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. The situation is they were dating, had a physical relationship, and during a moment of intimacy, discovered he's transgender. Now they feel like they were lied to because he didn't disclose this earlier, and their attraction has faded. They want to stay friends but not pursue anything more. The guy is upset and called them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user identifies as straight and is not attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose their status before the intimate moment. The user feels misled, which is understandable because such a significant detail wasn't shared until a crucial point. But the trans person might have been waiting for the right time or felt vulnerable. \n\nThe user stopped the interaction once they found out, which is respecting their own boundaries. They also mention that if the information was shared earlier, maybe they could have adjusted. But in the moment, it changed things for them. The friend's reaction is intense\u2014calling the user evil and manipulative\u2014but that's his emotional response, not necessarily justified. \n\nLegally and ethically, in many places, being transgender is a part of someone's identity. However, disclosure is a personal choice. The user isn't wrong for having preferences about their sexuality. You can't be wrong for not being attracted to someone, even if the reason is their gender identity. However, the way the user handled the situation matters. They stopped the interaction, communicated their feelings, and want to remain friends. They didn't act out of malice but based on their own feelings. \n\nThe trans person might feel hurt and rejected, which is valid. But the user isn't in the wrong for not changing their feelings. It's important to recognize that attraction is personal and not a choice. The user isn't at fault for the other person's emotional reaction, though they might need to navigate the friendship carefully to avoid further hurt feelings.\n\nSo, putting it together: the user isn't in the wrong for their feelings and actions. They communicated their boundaries and aren't forcing a relationship. The trans person's anger is about rejection and possible feelings of betrayal, but that doesn't make the user an asshole. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
