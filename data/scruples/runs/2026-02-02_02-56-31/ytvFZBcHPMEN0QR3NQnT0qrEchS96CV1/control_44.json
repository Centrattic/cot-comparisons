He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where one partner is transgender, and the author discovered this during a sexual encounter, then lost interest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their crush started as friends, developed a romantic connection, and things escalated to the point of a near-sex encounter. The author then discovered the trans status, which led to a loss of attraction. The author feels lied to because the other person didn't disclose this earlier. The partner is upset, feeling the author is cruelly ending the relationship.\n\nIs the author wrong for ending the relationship? Well, attraction is a personal thing and can't be controlled. The author isn't obligated to continue the relationship if they're not attracted. The trans person may have chosen when to disclose, which can be a sensitive issue. Some trans people wait until they feel comfortable or until it's relevant. However, if the author's strict straightness was known, maybe the partner should have mentioned it earlier. But the author didn't know about the trans status, so they couldn't have considered it. Ending the relationship because of a change in attraction isn't inherently wrong. The partner's reaction seems harsh, but the author isn't at fault for not wanting to continue. So, the answer is B.\n"
