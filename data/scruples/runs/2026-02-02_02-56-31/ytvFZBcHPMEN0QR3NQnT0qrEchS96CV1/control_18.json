He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a person who realizes their crush is trans and then isn't attracted anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author met someone at art school, became friends, and then developed a romantic relationship. They were close, even engaging in physical intimacy, but during a moment where they were about to have sex, the author discovered that their partner was trans. The partner didn't disclose this earlier, and now the author feels lied to. They're not interested in a vagina, so the attraction faded. The partner is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier, the author felt it was important enough to break the relationship, and the partner is now angry. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. First, the trans person's disclosure timing. When is it appropriate to share such personal information? Generally, people might discuss their gender identity before or during a romantic relationship, especially if it's relevant. However, it's possible that the trans person was nervous or unsure when to bring it up. But in this case, the author states that the person had months to tell them. The author might feel that the trans person didn't be honest early enough, which is a problem.\n\nSecond, the author's reaction. The author says they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's their personal orientation. They're not the one to blame for their feelings. However, the trans person might have a penis, depending on their transition. Wait, the author mentions that they noticed there's no bulge and he doesn't have a penis. So maybe the trans person is a trans woman? If the author is into people with penises, then a trans woman (assigned male at birth) would have one, but if the person is a trans man (assigned female at birth), then they might not. Wait, but the author noticed no bulge, so maybe the trans person is a trans woman who hasn't undergone surgery or something? Or a trans man who hasn't had surgery yet? The exact details aren't clear, but the key is the author thought they were dating someone with a penis and then found out they don't. So their attraction is based on having a penis, which the person doesn't, hence the loss of attraction.\n\nNow, the author is questioning whether they were in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. The partner is angry and calling them names. The author's main point is that the partner didn't disclose early enough, and the author is clear about their preferences. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, if someone is trans, it's important to be open about it, especially when it's relevant. However, the timing of disclosure can vary. Some people might not feel comfortable sharing until they know the other person better. But if the person had months to discuss it and chose not to, maybe the author feels misled. However, the partner might have felt it was a personal matter to disclose later. But in this case, the author is clear that this was a dealbreaker for them, which is their right.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship? No, because people have the right to know their own preferences and act on them. The issue is whether the trans person was dishonest. If the partner hadn't lied about their identity but simply hadn't disclosed it yet, then the author isn't wrong for feeling that the information came at an inopportune time. It's a personal choice, and the author isn't responsible for the partner's feelings of rejection. The partner's anger seems more about being rejected than the author's right to make a choice.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author isn't to blame for their feelings or for not continuing the relationship. The trans person's disclosure timing is questionable, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own attractions and honesty in the relationship.\n"
