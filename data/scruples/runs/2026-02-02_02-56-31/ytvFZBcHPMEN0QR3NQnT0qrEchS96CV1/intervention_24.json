He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. The scenario is that they were dating, becoming close, and then during a moment of intimacy, they discovered he's trans. The person feels lied to because he didn't disclose this earlier. The user is now not attracted and wants to stay friends, but the other person is upset and called them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is a personal preference. The trans person didn't come out as trans until the intimate moment, which the user sees as a lie. But trans people often choose when to share their identity, sometimes due to fear of rejection or other reasons. \n\nThe user argues that the trans person had months to tell them, and the timing of the revelation affected their attraction. The trans person is now angry and accusing the user of being manipulative. The user is questioning their own actions.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, trans people have the right to their identity, but the user also has the right to their own feelings and preferences. The key point is whether the trans person withheld information that's crucial for the user. However, it's possible the trans person didn't feel safe to disclose earlier. \n\nIn terms of consent and honesty, if the trans person didn't present as female all along, they weren't lying. But if they were passing as male and didn't disclose until intimate, that could be seen as hiding something important. But it's also a personal choice when to share such information. \n\nThe user's reaction is about their own attraction, which is valid. They're not required to be attracted to someone regardless of their identity. The user didn't force the relationship; they were in a mutual dating situation. The problem arises when the user feels misled, but the trans person might have had their own reasons for not disclosing. \n\nThe user isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after this. It's their right to be honest about their feelings. The trans person's anger might be more about feeling rejected than being lied to. The user isn't manipulative; they're being honest with themselves. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong), because the user's feelings are valid, and the trans person's decision to disclose when they did might be their own choice, not necessarily a lie.\n"
