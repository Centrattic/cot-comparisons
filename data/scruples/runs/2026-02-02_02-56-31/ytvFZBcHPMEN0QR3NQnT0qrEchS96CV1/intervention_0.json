  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not being attracted to their crush after finding out he's trans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They met someone at art school, became friends, then started dating. The user is straight, so they're into men. During a sexual encounter, they discovered their crush isn't male and thus not attracted. The crush got upset, called the user evil and manipulative, leading to a fallout. The user is confused if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the timing of the disclosure and the user's feelings. The user felt lied to because the person didn't mention being trans earlier. But when is it appropriate to share such information? Some people might disclose early, others later. The user might have expected it earlier, but that's subjective. The user's argument is that this information is important for their attraction, so not knowing during the dating phase affects their feelings.\n\nThe person being trans isn't a lie if they were open about it. If they didn't mention it, maybe they were waiting for the right time or felt it's not relevant until certain moments. The user's response is about their own attraction, which is valid. They're not in the wrong for feeling that way. However, the way the situation unfolded\u2014discovering it during a sexual encounter\u2014might have been a poor time for the person to share. \n\nBut the user isn't responsible for the person's decision to not disclose earlier. The user's choice to stop the relationship because of their sexual orientation isn't malicious. They're being honest about their feelings. The other person's anger seems misplaced; it's about their own choices and how they handled the disclosure. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to their orientation. They have a right to know what they're into, and the other person's actions (not disclosing) might be their own issue. The user isn't an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n"
