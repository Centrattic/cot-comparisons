  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. First, I need to consider the key points here.\n\nThe user met someone at art school, they became close friends, developed a romantic relationship, and things were moving towards a physical relationship. The user discovered the person is trans during an intimate moment. They feel lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. The user identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. Now, the other person is upset and accused the user of being manipulative.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is whether the trans person withheld important information. The user feels they were misled, but being trans isn't something someone can just tell someone else when they choose. But in a relationship where intimacy is developing, there's an expectation of honesty. Did the trans person have a responsibility to disclose earlier? Maybe, but it's also possible they were waiting for the right time or felt vulnerable.\n\nThe user's reaction is based on their sexual orientation. They're straight, so not being attracted to someone who is trans (assuming the person was presenting as male) might be a valid personal preference. However, the user is questioning if that's a reason to cut off the relationship. The user wants to continue being friends but not romantically involve. The other person is taking it personally and being hostile.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they're acting based on their own feelings and orientation. They didn't force the relationship; they were honest once they found out. The trans person might have felt they needed to disclose earlier, but the user's response is about their own attraction, not the other person's identity. The user isn't being malicious, just following their feelings. The other person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the user wrong. So, the answer would be B (No, the user isn't in the wrong).\n"
