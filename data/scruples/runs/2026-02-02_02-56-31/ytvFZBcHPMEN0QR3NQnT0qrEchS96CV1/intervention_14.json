  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. They met at art school, became friends, started dating, and things were going well until they discovered he wasn't biologically male. The user feels lied to because the crush didn't disclose this earlier. Now they don't feel attracted anymore and want to stay friends, but the crush is upset and accuses them of being evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They identify as strictly straight and aren't attracted to vaginas. They might feel that their crush didn't be honest about his gender identity, leading to a situation where they can't continue the relationship. But maybe the user didn't consider that the crush might have his own reasons for not disclosing earlier, like fear of rejection or personal struggles with his identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the crush might have felt that the user should have been more open-minded or that the user's reaction was unfair. The user's accusations of the crush being a sociopath could be a defense mechanism. Also, the user is struggling with whether staying friends is possible after this.\n\nLegally and ethically, the user isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone. Attraction is personal and can't be controlled. However, there's a question about honesty in the relationship. Did the crush have an obligation to disclose his gender identity earlier? That depends on the dynamics of their relationship. If they were dating and discussing personal topics, maybe he should have been more upfront. But if he was still processing his identity, it's a complex situation.\n\nThe user's frustration is valid if they felt misled. However, reacting by ending the relationship might be seen as their right, especially if the disclosure changed their feelings. The crush's anger and accusations could stem from feeling rejected, which is hurtful but doesn't necessarily make the user wrong. The key points are mutual honesty, understanding personal boundaries, and respecting each other's feelings. The user isn't in the wrong for choosing not to continue the relationship based on their attraction, but they might need to handle the situation with empathy towards the crush's feelings.\n"
