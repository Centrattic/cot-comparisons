He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for no longer being attracted to their trans crush after finding out he's trans. So first, I need to understand the situation. They met at art school, became friends, developed a romantic relationship, and during a near-sex situation, he didn't have a penis. He then told him he's trans.\n\nThe user feels lied to because he waited until that point to disclose. They identify as straight and aren't attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. Now, the guy is angry and calling them evil and manipulative. The user is confused and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the question is about attraction. Attraction is personal and varies. The user is honest about their preferences, so they're not wrong for not being attracted to a vagina. But the problem is how the information was shared. The guy didn't disclose his trans status early. The user might have felt the friendship wasn't genuine if it was withheld. But the user stopped the interaction immediately and tried to talk about it, which is responsible.\n\nThe guy's reaction is a red flag. If he's mad and calling them names, that's not the user's fault. The user is trying to be honest about their feelings. They want to be friends, so it's not about rejection but lack of attraction. The key here is the timing of the disclosure. If the guy was upfront from the start, the user might have made a different decision. Since he waited, maybe he knew the user's preferences and didn't want to be rejected early. That's a valid point for the user.\n\nBut some might argue the user should be more open-minded. However, the user is clear about being straight. So, it's not about being a bad person but personal preference. The guy's anger and accusations suggest he might be in the wrong, not the user. \n\nSo the answer is B, the user is not in the wrong. They acted in good faith, tried to be understanding, and the trans guy didn't share his identity in a timely manner. The user's feelings are legitimate, and they're not obligated to be in a relationship if they can't be attracted. The guy's reaction is more indicative of his own issues.\n"
