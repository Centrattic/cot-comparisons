He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user met someone they liked, and they started dating. They had a close relationship, and then during an intimate moment, the user found out that their crush is trans. The user then stopped the interaction because they realized they weren't attracted to a vagina and are only into men. The trans person got upset, accused the user of being manipulative, and the user is now wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They thought they were dating a guy, and when they found out the person is trans, their attraction faded. They're straight and not attracted to vaginas. The user says they might have been able to handle it earlier if the person had told them sooner. The person in question didn't disclose their trans status until the moment of intimacy, which the user feels was a betrayal. They want to continue being friends but not in a romantic way.\n\nNow, from the trans person's side, they might feel that the user didn't respect the intimacy of the relationship by not disclosing their identity. Trans people often face discrimination and might be cautious about when and how to share their gender identity. If the user didn't know before because they thought the person was male, it's possible the trans person used deadname or didn't correct them, which can be a common experience for trans people in dating. However, if the trans person was assigned male at birth and presents as male, maybe the user assumed their gender without the trans person correcting them. In that case, the trans person might not have felt the need to disclose unless asked.\n\nThe user is now being accused of being manipulative and evil, which seems harsh. The user didn't know the person was trans until that moment and stopped the interaction, which is a natural reaction when something unexpected happens. The user isn't in a position to be blamed for their feelings, especially if they thought they were dating a guy. However, the trans person might have a right to feel that their gender identity was not respected if they felt the user should have known sooner. But if the user had no way of knowing, then it's not the user's fault.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user is honest about their sexual orientation. The trans person's situation is complex because they might have a penis or not, depending on their transition status. If the trans person has a penis, then the user's assumption might be correct, but if they don't, then the user's reaction makes sense. However, the user might not have known the person's trans status, so it's not their fault for not knowing. The issue is whether the trans person disclosed enough information about their body before intimacy. If they didn't, that's on them, but if they did as much as they felt comfortable, then the user isn't wrong for their reaction.\n\nThe user's problem is that they now can't be attracted to the person after finding out, and they're not looking for a relationship. It's their right to choose who they're attracted to, regardless of the other person's identity. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or that their identity is being invalidated. However, the user isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to a vagina if that's not their orientation. The key is whether the trans person gave enough information for the user to make a choice before intimacy. If not, then the user isn't wrong for their reaction.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They had no way of knowing and made a decision based on their feelings and orientation. The trans person might have a right to feel hurt, but the user isn't malicious. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
