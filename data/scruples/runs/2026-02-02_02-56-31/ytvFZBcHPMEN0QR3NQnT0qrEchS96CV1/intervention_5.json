  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction when they found out their crush is trans. They were in a relationship that was becoming sexual, but when they realized the person wasn't a man, they stopped. The person is now upset and called the user names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is straight and not attracted to vaginas. They mention they might have been able to overcome it if the person had come out earlier. The trans person didn't disclose this until the situation escalated, which the user felt was a lie. \n\nThe key points here are about honesty and consent in relationships. The trans person didn't tell them about their identity in time for the user to make an informed choice. The user isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to a vagina, as that's a personal preference. They also didn't force anything; they stopped when they realized. \n\nHowever, the trans person might have felt they were being honest in their own way, maybe not knowing when to disclose or feeling it wasn't necessary at first. But the user's reaction is about their personal feelings and not about the trans person's identity. \n\nThe user is asking if they're an asshole for ending the relationship. Since they're not forcing anything and are honest about their preferences, they're probably not in the wrong. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not understood, but that doesn't make the user at fault. \n\nAlso, considering the user's emphasis on being straight and not wanting to be offensive, they\u2019re being honest about their feelings. They want to maintain friendship, which is respectful. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, they're not in the wrong). They\u2019re being truthful about their attractions and making decisions based on their values.\n"
