  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The scenario is about them finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to the end of the relationship. The user is asking if they're an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The user met someone they thought was a guy, they developed a relationship, and during a moment of intimacy, they discovered the person is trans. The user feels they were lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. They state they're strictly straight and aren't attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded. The other person is upset and called them names, leading the user to question their actions.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics, the trans person might be male-to-female, which means they might have a vagina. The user might have assumed the person was cisgender (male) and didn't know about their trans status. The user is now feeling that the trans person didn't come clean in time, leading to confusion and hurt feelings.\n\nBut from a trans rights perspective, transitioning is a personal journey. Some trans people might not disclose their status immediately, especially if they're in a relationship and the other person hasn't asked. The user didn't know the person was trans before, so maybe the trans person didn't mention it because they felt it wasn't relevant or they were waiting for the right time. However, in a close relationship where physical intimacy is involved, some people might expect their partner to be honest about such a significant aspect of their identity.\n\nThe user's reaction is to withdraw attraction and end the relationship, which they feel is justified because they're straight. However, the trans person might feel that the user's reaction is discriminatory or that they were being judged. The user might not be in the wrong for not being attracted, as sexual orientation is personal. But the trans person's anger could stem from feeling rejected or that the user didn't respect their identity.\n\nI need to consider if the user is being fair. If the trans person didn't lie and the user didn't ask, then maybe the user isn't at fault for not knowing. The user can't be blamed for their sexual orientation, but they might be responsible for not addressing the lack of disclosure. However, the trans person's responsibility is to disclose if it's a significant issue. Since the user only found out during intimacy, maybe the trans person should have mentioned it earlier if it was a deal-breaker.\n\nBut also, some trans people might not want to be defined by their gender identity and expect others to see them as male or female regardless of their biology. The user's reaction might be seen as invalidating the trans person's identity. However, the user's own orientation is a valid reason to not feel attracted. The user isn't in the wrong for their feelings, but maybe for how they handled the situation. However, given the circumstances, the user acted on their own feelings without prior knowledge, which might not be their fault.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, they're not in the wrong) because they're not responsible for the other person's decision not to disclose earlier, and their feelings are valid. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the user isn't an asshole for ending the relationship due to their orientation.\n"
