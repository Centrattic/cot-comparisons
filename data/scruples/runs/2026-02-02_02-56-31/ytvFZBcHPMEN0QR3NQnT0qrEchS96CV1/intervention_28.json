  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for no longer being attracted to their trans crush after finding out he's trans. They were in a relationship, had become close friends, and the situation escalated to a point where the user discovered the trans identity during a sexual encounter. The user now feels like they were lied to because the other person didn't disclose this earlier. The user isn't attracted to vaginas and is straight, so they broke off the relationship, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects. It's important to recognize that being transgender is a part of someone's identity, and they have the right to live authentically. However, in relationships, honesty and communication are key. The user feels misled because the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity earlier. But when is the appropriate time to share such personal information? It's generally expected that major aspects of identity are shared before engaging in intimate or sexual relationships. If the trans person didn't share this information before the relationship became sexual, that could be seen as withholding important information. However, the user's reaction is also a personal preference\u2014being strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas is a valid personal choice. \n\nBut the user is being accused of being inconsiderate. The trans person might feel hurt that the user ended the relationship after the fact, especially if they had formed a close bond. The user's argument is that the trans person had months to disclose, but it's also possible that the trans person was waiting for the right time or felt vulnerable about sharing. However, if the user is strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas, then the relationship was based on a premise that the user can't fulfill. \n\nIn many cases, people do disclose their gender identity when they feel comfortable, but if the relationship moves into sexual territory without that disclosure, it's a problem. The user's decision to end the relationship is based on their personal attraction, which isn't something they can control. However, the way the relationship ended might have been harsh if it wasn't handled with empathy. The user could have approached the situation with more sensitivity, but their choice to end it isn't inherently wrong. \n\nThe trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or devalued, but their accusation of the user being evil or manipulative seems extreme. The user's attraction is a personal matter, and it's not fair to expect someone to stay in a relationship if they're not romantically or physically attracted. So, in this scenario, the user isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to personal incompatibility. The trans person should have been honest earlier, but the user's right to their own preferences stands. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
