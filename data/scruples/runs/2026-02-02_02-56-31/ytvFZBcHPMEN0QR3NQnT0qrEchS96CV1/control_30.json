He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to their trans crush anymore after finding out they're trans. \n\nFirst, the situation: They met someone at art school, became friends, developed feelings, and started dating. The key point is that the author discovered their crush is trans (assigned male at birth but identifies as female) during a sexual encounter. The author felt lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier. Now, the author is no longer attracted and wants to remain friends, but the trans person is upset and accused the author of being evil.\n\nSo, the main issues here are attraction, disclosure, and consent. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. They argue that the trans person didn't disclose their identity early enough, leading to the author feeling misled. But wait, if the trans person identifies as female, then they're part of the LGBTQ+ community, and their gender identity is a core part of who they are. However, the question is about whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after discovering this.\n\nFrom a social perspective, many people argue that gender identity should be disclosed early in a relationship, especially when considering a romantic and sexual relationship. However, in this case, the trans person may have felt that their physical body hadn't fully transitioned yet, or they weren't ready to share that information. But withholding such a significant detail that affects the other person's attraction could be seen as a problem.\n\nThe author's reaction is about their own attraction. It's their right to have certain preferences in a partner. However, the way the author approached the situation\u2014stopping immediately and not continuing the relationship\u2014could be seen as abrupt. But the author isn't being condemned for not wanting to continue; the question is whether they're wrong for that decision.\n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations might stem from feeling rejected or invalidated. The author might not be in the wrong because they're acting on their own feelings and preferences. However, the author could have handled the breakup more sensitively, acknowledging the trans person's feelings and explaining their own without being dismissive.\n\nBut the crux is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship. Since the author is honest about their preferences and didn't continue the relationship in bad faith, most would say they aren't in the wrong. The trans person's actions might be more questionable if they withheld information that affects the relationship's foundation. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
