He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after their crush, who is trans, didn't have a penis, and they stopped being attracted. They felt lied to because the person didn't disclose earlier. The user wants to remain friends but not date, but the other person is upset and called them names.\n\nFirst, understanding the situation: The person they were dating is transgender. The user is strictly straight, not attracted to vaginas, and found out during a moment of intimacy. The trans person didn't disclose earlier, which the user feels is a lie. Now they're friends, but the user is confused about their feelings and if they're wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. Transgender people may choose when and how to disclose their status. However, in a romantic relationship, certain expectations exist regarding physical intimacy. The user's attraction is based on the person being male (with a penis), which they found out wasn't the case. But the trans person might have identified as male and presented as such, leading the user to believe they were dating a man. \n\nWait, but if the trans person is male (trans man), then they have a penis. If the user found out there was no penis, maybe the person is a trans woman, but the user thought they were a guy. Or perhaps the person is intersex or another identity. The scenario is a bit unclear. The user mentions the person is trans, but doesn't specify male or female. However, the user is a woman being attracted to someone they thought was a man, and upon discovering they are trans (maybe female), loses attraction.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user isn't in the wrong for not being attracted. Attraction is personal. The trans person might have felt it was their business to disclose when they felt comfortable. However, in a romantic context, certain physical aspects are expected. If the trans person is a trans woman (assigned female at birth), presenting as male, and didn't disclose, the user might feel misled about their gender. But if the person is a trans man (assigned male at birth), then they have a penis, so the user's confusion might be misplaced.\n\nBut the user's account says the person is trans and the user found out during intimacy. Assuming the person is a trans woman (female-to-male?), but the user is a woman, and she's into men. If the person is a trans woman, then she has a vagina, so the user's attraction is based on male anatomy. If the person didn't disclose, the user might feel they weren't told an important detail. However, the trans person might have felt safe to come out later. The user isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because attraction is subjective. The other person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not respected, but the user isn't evil for not wanting to continue. The answer would be B, No.\n"
