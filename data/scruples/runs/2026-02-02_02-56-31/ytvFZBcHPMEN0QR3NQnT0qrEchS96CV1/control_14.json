He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to their crush after finding out he's trans. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they developed a romantic relationship with this person, even going on dates and making out. The key point here is that the person is trans, and the author didn't know until they were about to have sex. The author feels lied to because the trans identity wasn't disclosed earlier, even though they had been friends for months.\n\nThe author identifies as strictly straight, so their attraction to someone with a vagina isn't there. They feel that if the person had told them earlier, maybe they could have adjusted their feelings. But because it came up at such a crucial moment, their attraction faded. Now the friend is upset and accused the author of being manipulative, which is causing conflict.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong here. The main issue is the lack of disclosure from the trans person. Trans people often face challenges in disclosing their identity due to fear of rejection or discrimination. However, in a romantic context, some people do feel that certain information should be shared earlier to avoid misunderstandings. \n\nBut the author's feelings are valid. If someone's sexual orientation is strictly towards a specific gender, and the other person's anatomy doesn't match that, it's natural that attraction might diminish. The author isn't showing hostility; they're expressing that their attraction is based on certain physical attributes they didn't want to disclose. \n\nThe trans person might have felt they couldn't share their identity earlier, maybe due to anxiety or not knowing if the relationship was serious enough. However, withholding such information that's a deal-breaker for the other person could lead to this kind of situation. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to pursue a relationship if the attraction is gone. They tried to maintain the friendship, which is respectful. The trans person's anger and accusations seem misplaced; the author isn't being evil or manipulative. They're dealing with their own feelings and boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
