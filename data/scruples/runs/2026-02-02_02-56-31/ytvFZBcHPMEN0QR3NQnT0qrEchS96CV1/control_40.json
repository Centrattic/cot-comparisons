He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to the end of the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the scenario. The author and their crush were friends for months, developed a romantic relationship, and things were progressing towards a sexual encounter. The author discovered during this moment that the crush is trans, which led to a loss of attraction. The author feels like they were lied to because the crush didn't disclose being trans earlier. The crush is upset and accuses the author of being evil and manipulative, which the author now sees as a sociopath.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break down the factors.\n\n1. **Disclosure Timing**: The author feels the crush didn't disclose their trans status early enough. The crush waited until a sexual encounter to reveal this information. The author thinks that if they had known earlier, maybe they could have adjusted their feelings. But since it was during the intimate moment, it was a deal-breaker.\n\n2. **Attraction and Orientation**: The author identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas. This is their personal preference. The author isn't in the wrong for their sexual orientation. It's a personal choice and not something they can control. However, the question is whether not continuing the relationship makes them an asshole.\n\n3. **Communication and Honesty**: The crush didn't disclose their trans status until the moment of intimacy. This could be seen as a lack of communication. However, trans people often have reasons for not disclosing early, such as fear of rejection or coming out themselves. But in a progressing romantic relationship, certain information is usually shared before physical intimacy.\n\n4. **Reaction After the Fact**: The author stopped the encounter, expressed their feelings, and wanted to remain friends. They didn't lie about their feelings but were honest about their attraction. The crush's reaction is harsh, calling the author names, which might indicate their own issues. The author isn't forcing the relationship; they're choosing to end it based on their feelings.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: The author isn't in a position to be blamed for their preferences. However, the crush may have withheld information that's important for the author. But the author's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious. They're acting based on their own feelings and orientation.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a difficult decision based on their own feelings and communicated it. The crush's anger stems from the author's honesty about their lack of attraction. The author isn't being manipulative; they're being truthful about their preferences. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
