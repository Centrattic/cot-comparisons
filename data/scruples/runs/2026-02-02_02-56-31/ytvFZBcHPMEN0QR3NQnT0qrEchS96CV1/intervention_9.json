  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. They met at art school, became friends, developed a relationship, and things were getting intimate. The key moment was when the user discovered he wasn't male, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They mention they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The person they were dating didn't disclose his transgender status until a very intimate moment. The user feels lied to because he waited months to tell them, which they consider important. They want to continue being friends but not in a romantic way, but the other person is upset and called them names like \"evil\" and \"manipulative.\"\n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, the trans person's decision to not disclose his identity earlier is a point of contention. However, transgender people are people who identify with a gender different from their assigned sex at birth. The user is confused because they expected a penis but found a vagina. But the trans person might have presented as male for a long time, which could mean he wasn't hiding his gender identity but rather living as his true self. However, if he had a gender confirmation surgery or other changes, maybe disclosure would be necessary depending on the situation.\n\nThe user's reaction is based on their sexual orientation and the sudden change in attraction. They feel it's their right to know before becoming intimate. But was the trans person obligated to disclose this information earlier? Some people might argue that if someone is in a relationship, they should know such personal details, but others might say it's not necessary unless they're seeking a specific gender for a relationship.\n\nThe user is now being blamed by the trans person, who called them names. That's a red flag. The user is trying to be honest about their feelings and orientation, which is valid. They're not pretending to be attracted to someone they aren't. The trans person's reaction seems aggressive and invalidating.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't in the wrong for being straight. Their attraction is based on their orientation. However, the trans person might have been in the wrong for not being upfront if the user had asked or if disclosure was necessary for their relationship. But the user didn't ask, and the trans person might not have seen the need to share it unless necessary.\n\nThe user's decision to end the romantic relationship but continue friendship is reasonable. They're not being evil or manipulative. The trans person's anger seems misplaced, as the user is being honest about their feelings. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
