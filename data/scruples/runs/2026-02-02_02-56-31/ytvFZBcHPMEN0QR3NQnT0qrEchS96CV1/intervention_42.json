  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction when they found out their crush is trans. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, they met this guy at art school, became friends, developed a relationship, and things were getting romantic. Then, during an intimate moment, the user discovers the person is trans. The user feels like they were lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. They stopped the relationship, and now the other person is upset, calling them names.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the user is wrong for ending the relationship after discovering the person is trans. The user is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction diminished. The other person is upset, possibly feeling rejected or hurt.\n\nIn terms of ethics, everyone has the right to their own attractions and preferences. The user didn't know the person was trans, so they might not have considered that aspect when developing feelings. The person in question didn't disclose their trans identity, which the user considers important. However, the user is now choosing not to pursue a relationship because of this, which is their personal choice.\n\nThe key points here are consent and honesty. The trans person might have felt they couldn't reveal their identity earlier due to fear of rejection or other reasons. But the user might feel misled if it was withheld. However, the user is making a choice based on their own preferences, which is valid. They aren't being malicious; they're just realizing their attraction is gone.\n\nThe user's actions\u2014stopping the relationship and wanting to remain friends\u2014don't seem malicious. They're being honest about their feelings. The trans person's reaction might be due to hurt feelings, but that doesn't make the user wrong for ending the relationship. The user isn't obligated to change their preferences for others.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the user is acting based on their own preferences and honesty.\n"
