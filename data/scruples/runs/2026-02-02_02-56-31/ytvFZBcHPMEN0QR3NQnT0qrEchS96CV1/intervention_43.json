  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for no longer being attracted to their trans crush after finding out he's trans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user met someone at art school, became friends, and developed a romantic relationship. The key point here is that the user discovered the person is trans during a sexual encounter. They feel like they were lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. The user is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. Now, the person is upset and called them names.\n\nHmm, the user is concerned about whether they're in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. The trans person didn't disclose their identity early on, which the user sees as a lie. But maybe the trans person felt vulnerable sharing that information. The user might not have considered that the trans person was waiting for the right time or felt safe enough to share. However, the user also has the right to their own feelings and attractions.\n\nAttraction is personal and valid. If someone isn't physically attracted to their partner after discovering a significant detail, it's understandable. The user isn't rejecting the person's identity but their physical traits. The trans person might have felt they were being rejected for who they are, which is a common issue in trans relationships. But the user isn't in the wrong for their feelings; they can't help who they're attracted to.\n\nThe trans person's reaction seems hurtful and possibly a defense mechanism. Calling the user names is not okay, but that doesn't mean the user was wrong to end the relationship. The user tried to maintain friendship, which is respectful. They didn't push for more than they wanted. The key is whether the user acted with intent to deceive or hurt, which they didn't. They had the right to be honest about their feelings once they changed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They had the right to their feelings and to communicate them once they realized the attraction was gone. The trans person's hurt feelings are valid, but the user isn't the asshole here.\n"
