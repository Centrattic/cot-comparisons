He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship that ended when the author discovered their crush is trans. The key points here are the author's reaction to the trans identity and the subsequent breakdown of the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they didn't know their partner was trans until a sexual encounter. The partner had known this for months but didn't disclose it earlier. The author feels lied to because they consider this information vital for their attraction. They clarify they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the revelation changed their feelings.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The trans partner didn't disclose their identity until the sexual act was about to happen. This could be seen as a failure to be honest from the start, especially since the author states that if told earlier, they might have handled it differently. However, the trans person's right to self-identify and their own journey should also be considered. But in terms of honesty in a relationship, withholding a detail that's crucial for the other person's feelings could be a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's reaction is to end the romantic relationship but want to remain friends. However, the partner is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative. The author feels hurt and confused. The main issue is whether the author is at fault for not continuing the relationship after discovering the trans identity.\n\nLegally and ethically, people have the right to their own preferences in partners. The author isn't obligated to be attracted to trans individuals. However, the trans person's decision to not disclose earlier might be a point of contention. But the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings or the decision to end the relationship. The partner's anger and accusations suggest they might be in the wrong for not being honest sooner and for reacting with hostility to the author's genuine feelings.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author isn't obligated to maintain a relationship if their attraction is based on certain traits they weren't aware of. The trans individual's failure to disclose early enough and the author's right to their own preferences make the author not at fault here.\n"
