  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. First, I need to understand the situation. The person met someone at art school, became friends, started dating, and during a intimate moment found out he's transgender. The user feels lied to because he didn't disclose this earlier, and now they're not attracted anymore. The trans person is upset and called them names.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The user is straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, which makes sense. The trans guy didn't come out earlier, which the user sees as a lie. But maybe the trans person had reasons for not disclosing, like fear of rejection or not wanting to overshare early on. However, the user argues that it's a significant detail that affects the user's attraction. \n\nIn terms of ethics, everyone has the right to know certain details about their partner that affect their comfort. But when is the right time to disclose? If someone is trans, it's important to share that before becoming intimate. But if the user expects someone to tell early on, and the trans person waited until a sexual encounter, that's a problem. However, the user's reaction is also about their own preferences. They're not attracted to women, so this was a dealbreaker for them.\n\nThe trans person might feel hurt because the user ended things right after the disclosure, but the user isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if it's not what they want. The key here is that the user isn't being malicious; they're acting based on their own feelings and preferences. It's possible that the trans person felt they couldn't come out earlier, which is a valid struggle, but the user isn't responsible for that. They didn't know and had a right to be informed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They're making a decision based on their own feelings, and while it's unfortunate, they aren't obligated to change their preferences. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the user isn't being evil or manipulative. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
