He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author met someone at art school, became friends, and then started dating. They were getting intimate, and when the author went to unbutton the guy's pants, they realized he's trans. The author felt lied to because the guy didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight, not attracted to vaginas, and now the relationship is over. The guy is upset and called the author names. The author is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the trans person's perspective. When does disclosure of gender identity become necessary? It's a sensitive issue. The guy didn't mention it earlier, but maybe he felt it wasn't important until the right time. However, if the author's orientation is strictly towards men (penises), then the guy might not have realized that the author would see this as a deal-breaker. But the author didn't ask him about his gender identity either. \n\nThe author argues that the guy didn't disclose this, leading to a situation where the author felt misled. But is that actually lying? If the guy presented as male and didn't hide his trans status, maybe it's not a lie. However, withholding such information when it's relevant to the relationship could be seen as deceptive. But the author also didn't ask, and maybe expected the guy to share when he felt comfortable.\n\nThe author is now cutting off the relationship because of this. Is that fair? If the author is strictly straight, then they can't be expected to be attracted to a trans woman. But the author also liked the person as a friend and maybe could have tried to adjust. However, attraction is personal. The guy is upset because the author ended things, but the author feels it's because of a lack of attraction.\n\nIs the author wrong for ending the relationship? Probably not. They're not in the wrong for not being attracted to someone. The trans guy might have been wrong for not disclosing earlier if it's a significant factor. But the author isn't obligated to continue a relationship based on something they can't control (their attraction). The guy's anger might be misplaced. The author isn't being manipulative; they're being honest about their feelings after a situation that made them uncomfortable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
