He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person met their crush, and they started dating. Then, during a moment of intimacy, the author discovers that their crush is trans, specifically a trans woman. The author feels like they were lied to because the crush didn't mention this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. Now the crush is upset and called the author names.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about honesty in relationships and attraction. The author is questioning if they're an asshole for ending the relationship after finding out. The crush didn't disclose being trans before things got physical. But wait, the crush is trans, and maybe she's presenting as female, so maybe the author didn't know. But in some cases, people might not disclose until they're comfortable. However, in a relationship, being honest about one's identity is important. \n\nBut the author is straight, so their attraction is based on biology. The crush didn't lie about being a woman; she's a woman. The author might have had certain expectations based on their own orientation. But is the author in the wrong for changing their mind once they found out? They didn't know before, so maybe they had the right to make up their mind once they found out. \n\nOn the other hand, the crush might have felt they needed to be in a relationship first to feel safe sharing. But the author might not have been attracted to her after knowing. The author is not being offensive, just stating their preferences. Ending a relationship because of attraction isn't their fault. The crush's reaction seems extreme, calling the author names without understanding their perspective. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're honest about their feelings and had the right to change their mind upon discovering something important. The crush might have been dishonest by not sharing earlier, but the author isn't the asshole here for ending things. The answer is B.\n"
