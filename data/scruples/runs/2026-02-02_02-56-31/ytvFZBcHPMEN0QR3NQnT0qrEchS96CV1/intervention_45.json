He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after discovering their crush is trans and losing attraction. The key points here are about honesty, timing of disclosure, and the user's feelings of being lied to.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a romantic relationship that was built on months of friendship. The user felt the person they were dating didn't disclose their trans status until during a sexual encounter. The user considers themselves strictly straight and now feels the attraction has faded, leading to a breakup. The other person is upset, calling the user names, which adds to the emotional tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. From a typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" perspective, the user is seeking validation that their reaction is justified. The core issue here is the trans person's disclosure timing. Trans individuals often face societal pressures and may choose when to disclose their identity, especially in relationships. However, if the user believes that the disclosure came too late, that could be a point of contention.\n\nIn many cases, relationships require mutual honesty about significant factors. If the trans person had disclosed earlier, the user might have had time to process or decide if they wanted to continue. However, the user is now feeling that the lack of disclosure led to a loss of trust. On the other hand, the trans person might have felt vulnerable or unsafe to disclose earlier, especially in a new relationship.\n\nThe user's argument is that they were straightforward about their attractions, and if the person had been honest upfront, the user could have made a different choice. However, the user is also facing criticism from the other person, which could indicate that the trans person feels betrayed or disrespected. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's generally expected that partners disclose significant information that affects the relationship's direction. But trans people also have the right to privacy and safety. The user isn't discriminating based on a protected category like race or religion, but their attraction is based on physical attributes. It's a personal preference, and while it might be considered part of being transphobic by some, the user is not in the wrong for having those preferences unless they're acting on prejudice.\n\nConsidering all these angles, the user's reaction seems valid. They're not being malicious; they simply found out something that changed their attraction. The trans person's anger and accusations might stem from feeling rejected or that their identity wasn't respected. But the user isn't at fault for not wanting to continue the relationship once they knew the truth. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
