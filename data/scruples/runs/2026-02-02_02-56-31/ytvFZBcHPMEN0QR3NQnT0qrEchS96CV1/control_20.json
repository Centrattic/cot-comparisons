  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author met a guy at art school, they became close friends, developed a romantic relationship, and things were going well. The key moment was when the author discovered the guy is transgender, specifically that he doesn't have a penis. The author stopped the situation, felt lied to, and now doesn't want to continue the relationship, which upset the guy. The author questions if they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship and being strict about their straightness.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The author's stance is that they are straight and not attracted to a vagina, which they clarify. The trans guy didn't disclose his gender identity earlier, and the author feels that this omission is significant. However, gender identity is a personal aspect, and people might choose when to share such information.\n\nFrom a general perspective, being transgender is a part of someone's identity, but it's not something that can be easily hidden in all situations. However, it's also about when and how to share such information. The author might not have known that the guy was trans, and the guy might have felt comfortable sharing it later. The author's reaction is based on their attraction being solely to men, which is their personal preference. But does that make them an asshole?\n\nIf the author isn't in the wrong, it's because they're honest about their feelings and preferences. They didn't hide their intentions, and the guy didn't disclose his identity until a specific moment. However, the guy might have had the opportunity to share this information earlier, which could have affected the author's decision. The accusation that the guy faked the friendship and called the author manipulative is more on him, suggesting he might be handling it poorly.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if they aren't attracted to the person after learning something significant. The real issue here is mutual honesty. If the trans guy didn't disclose earlier, that's on him, but the author is not wrong for not wanting to pursue a relationship based on their current feelings. The author is also trying to maintain a friendship, which shows they aren't malicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're being honest about their preferences and aren't obligated to change their feelings. The trans guy might have a different perspective, but the author's actions are justified based on their stated orientation and the information they had at the time.\n"
