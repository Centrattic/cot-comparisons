  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction. They feel like they were lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. They stopped the intimate encounter when they realized, and the other person is upset and called them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They were friends for months, developed a romantic connection, and the trans person didn't disclose their identity until the intimate moment. The user is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded upon discovery. They want to stay friends but not pursue a relationship. The trans person is angry, calling them evil and manipulative.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, the user's main issue is about attraction and disclosure. The trans person didn't tell them earlier, which made the user feel lied to. But maybe the trans person felt they needed to come out in their own time. However, when in a romantic relationship, especially with physical intimacy, there's an expectation of transparency. The user might not be in the wrong for losing attraction, as attraction is personal. They could feel they were set up to find out during a vulnerable moment, which is unfair. But the user didn't push for disclosure earlier. On the other hand, the user did stop the encounter and try to be understanding about the other person's struggles. The trans person's anger might be from feeling rejected, but lashing out and calling the user names is not justified. The user isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if they're not attracted. So, the answer is likely B (No, the user isn't in the wrong).\n"
