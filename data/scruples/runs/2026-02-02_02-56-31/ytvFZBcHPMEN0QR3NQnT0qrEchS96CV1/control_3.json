He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a trans guy and the author finding out he's trans during a moment of intimacy, leading to the author no longer being attracted. The author feels the guy didn't disclose this information early enough, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author states they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans guy didn't come out as trans until the moment when the author was about to have sex with him. The author feels lied to and that the guy withheld important information. The guy then reacted angrily, calling the author manipulative, which the author finds confusing.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's perspective is that since they're straight, the guy's trans status changes their attraction. However, does the guy have an obligation to disclose his trans status before a certain point? It depends on the relationship's stage. If they're in a serious relationship where personal details are shared, then maybe earlier disclosure would have been better. But if they were in the process of building a relationship and the guy felt comfortable sharing as they got closer, perhaps it's not his fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a situation where their attraction is based on the person being male. Since the guy is trans, the author's attraction is now gone. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. Sexual orientation is about attraction to certain genders, and if the person's gender identity isn't what the author expected, it's natural for that attraction to fade. The author isn't being discriminatory if they're honest about their preferences. \n\nThe guy might have felt he needed to be in a trusting environment to come out. If he felt that disclosing earlier would have jeopardized the friendship or relationship, maybe he waited until he felt safe. But if the author needed that information to make informed decisions about their attraction, then the guy's timing was an issue. However, the author can't be blamed for not wanting to stay in a relationship if the trans status is a deal-breaker for them. \n\nThe guy's reaction, calling the author evil and manipulative, seems disproportionate and possibly hurtful. That might indicate his own issues in handling rejection. The author's decision to not continue the relationship isn't malicious if it's based on their own feelings and orientation. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for not continuing the relationship because their feelings are genuine and based on their sexual orientation. The trans guy might have been responsible for disclosing earlier if that was a key factor, but the author isn't at fault for their reaction. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
