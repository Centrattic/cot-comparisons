  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a crush on someone who turned out to be transgender. They started dating, got close, and during a moment where they were about to have sex, the person discovered the other wasn't biologically male. Now they feel like they were lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier. The person is wondering if they're an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both people. The user is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so when they found out the other person is trans, their attraction faded. They think the other person should have told them earlier. The trans person, on the other hand, might have felt that their identity wasn't something they wanted to disclose upfront, maybe due to fear of rejection or discrimination. \n\nThe user argues that the trans person didn't tell them something important, leading to a loss of attraction. But is the user in the wrong for ending the relationship? Well, attraction is a personal thing. If someone isn't physically attracted to their partner, it's hard to maintain a romantic relationship. The user isn't being malicious; they just found out something that changes their attraction. \n\nHowever, the trans person not disclosing their identity might be an issue. If the user had asked or if there was a discussion about such topics earlier, maybe the trans person should have shared. But in many cases, people don't disclose personal details like gender identity unless asked. Also, the trans person might have been in the process of transitioning or felt safe enough after being friends for months. \n\nThe user isn't breaking the relationship out of malice but because their attraction is gone. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or perhaps fear of being hurt again. But calling the user evil or manipulative seems extreme. The user's decision isn't malicious; it's based on their own feelings and attraction. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's no obligation to disclose one's gender identity unless it's a medical procedure or something like that. So the user isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because of a change in attraction after discovering something they didn't know before. The trans person might have handled disclosure differently, but the user's reaction is about personal preference, not about right or wrong in a moral sense. \n\nSo putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They had the right to discover their attraction based on the information they had. The trans person might feel hurt, but that doesn't make the user an asshole. The answer should be B for No.\n"
