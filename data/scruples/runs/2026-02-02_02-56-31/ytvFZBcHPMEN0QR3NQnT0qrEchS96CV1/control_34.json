He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a crush who's trans, and the author stopped being attracted after finding out. So, first, I need to understand the key points here.\n\nThe author met someone at art school, became friends, then developed a romantic relationship. They were getting physically intimate when the author discovered the person is transgender. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier, and now they're not attracted anymore. The trans person is upset and called the author names. The author is questioning if they're an asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship because of the person being trans. Let's think about consent and communication. The trans person didn't tell them earlier, which the author feels is a big omission. But maybe there's a reason they didn't come out sooner. Trans people often decide when to share their identity, and maybe they were worried about how it'd be received. However, if the author is strictly straight, then the relationship wasn't a good fit in the first place. \n\nThe author didn't know the person was trans until that intimate moment. That's a big deal because when people date, they expect to know such important details. The trans person might have been waiting for the right time to come out, but starting a romantic relationship without that information could be a problem. The author is now not attracted, which is their personal preference. If someone is transgender and undergoing transition, maybe the author's attraction is based on physical characteristics. But the author isn't being offensive, just stating their preference.\n\nThe trans person's reaction of calling the author names might be due to feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author is being honest about their feelings. They want to stay friends but not pursue a relationship. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because they're not attracted. It's about mutual honesty and compatibility. The trans person might have been dishonest by not disclosing earlier, but the author's response is about their own feelings. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. The trans person may have made a mistake by not coming out sooner, but the author's reaction is valid. It's important to respect each other's boundaries and honesty in relationships.\n"
