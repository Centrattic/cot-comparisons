He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author realizing their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to the end of the relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met someone at art school, became friends, developed a romantic relationship with heavy make-out sessions. During a moment when they were about to have sex, the author discovers the person is trans. The author feels lied to because the trans identity wasn't disclosed earlier. The author is straight, doesn't find vaginas attractive, and wants to stay friends but not pursue a romantic relationship. The crush is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author didn't know the person was trans until that moment. The crush didn't disclose their trans status before the relationship became serious. The author is honest about their preferences. But the author is now ending the relationship after the fact.\n\nFrom a trans rights perspective, it's important to note that being trans is a fundamental part of identity. However, the author didn't know this until the relationship was already in a physical stage. The crush didn't mention it earlier, which could be seen as lacking transparency. But in some cases, people might not disclose such information early if they feel safe. However, if that information affects the potential partner's willingness to engage in a relationship, it's important to share it before things become serious.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation. They are straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's valid, but the timing of the discovery is an issue. The crush didn't disclose it before the relationship got physical. The author might feel misled because there was a lack of information that's important to them. But the author is not in the wrong for having certain attractions; people can't help who they're attracted to. However, acting on that after physical intimacy might be problematic. \n\nWait, but the author ended the relationship after finding out, which is their right. The crush is upset and accused the author of being manipulative, which might be a defensive reaction. The author is not choosing to continue the relationship because of their own preferences. The key question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship because of the trans identity. Since the author is honest about their preferences, and the other person didn't disclose early enough, the author isn't in the wrong. The author's actions are based on their own feelings and orientation, which are valid. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
