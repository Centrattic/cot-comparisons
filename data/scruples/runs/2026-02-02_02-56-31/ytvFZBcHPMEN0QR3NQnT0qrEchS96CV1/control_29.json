He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that their crush is trans and then losing attraction, leading to a breakup. The trans person is upset and called the author evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key facts. The author and the trans person were in a relationship for months. The author didn't know the person was trans until a moment when they were about to have sex. The author is straight and wasn't attracted to the person after that discovery. The trans person didn't disclose being trans earlier, which the author feels was a significant omission. Now the author wants to stay friends but not pursue a romantic relationship, and the other person is angry about it.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship. To determine this, I should analyze if either party acted in a deceptive or manipulative way. The trans person didn't come out as trans before the relationship became sexual. That's a big point. It's important to note that while people can choose when to disclose their gender identity, withholding such information in a sexual relationship could be seen as a breach of honesty, especially if it's a factor someone might consider in their attraction or desire to have a sexual relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is stating their truth about being attracted to men and not women. If the trans person is a man, but has a vagina due to transition, the author's confusion is understandable. However, the author's discomfort with the anatomy and subsequent loss of attraction might be personal, and they have the right to their feelings. However, the way they ended things could matter. The author didn't express the issue beforehand and only realized it during the act. The trans person might have felt that the author knew they were trans, or perhaps there was a misunderstanding about the person's identity.\n\nAnother angle is the trans person's reaction. Calling the author manipulative and fake could be a defensive response, but it doesn't justify the accusation. However, if the trans person didn't disclose their identity before a sexual encounter, that could be a problem. The author is not in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after a key part of their identity was a factor in their attraction. The author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if a significant aspect was not disclosed, especially if it affects their ability to be in a sexual relationship.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the trans person deceive by not disclosing gender identity? And is the author wrong for ending the relationship because of that? In many cases, people don't have to disclose everything upfront, but when it comes to sexual activity, certain details are often considered important. If the trans person is a man who is on hormones and has a vagina (but not a penis), the author might have had a misconception about the person's anatomy. The trans person's failure to clarify that could be a miscommunication, but it's also possible the author assumed the trans person's anatomy. However, the author's right to their own preferences is valid. The author isn't wrong for being honest about their attraction. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if the terms have changed.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They can't be expected to continue a relationship if a significant aspect (attractiveness and anatomy) was not disclosed and now affects their ability to be in a relationship. The trans person's reaction might be unkind, but the author isn't responsible for that. The answer is B.\n"
