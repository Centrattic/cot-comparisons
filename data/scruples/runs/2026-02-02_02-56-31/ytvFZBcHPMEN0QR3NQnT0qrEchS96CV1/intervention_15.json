He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the question is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand the key points.\n\nThe user met a guy at art school and developed a relationship. They became close friends, started dating, and things were getting romantic. The user didn't know the guy was trans until a moment when they were about to have sex. The guy didn't disclose his gender identity until that point. The user is now feeling like they were lied to because the guy didn't tell him early on. They are straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. The guy is upset and called the user names, making the user feel like they're being blamed.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the user is wrong for ending the relationship after finding out the guy is trans. The user argues that the guy didn't disclose his identity in time, which is important for the user's attraction. The user also mentions that if the guy had told him earlier, maybe he could have adjusted his feelings. But since it was a surprise, the user is no longer interested and wants to stay friends.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Did the guy have an obligation to disclose his trans status early in the relationship? In many cases, people don't disclose such personal information until they feel comfortable and when it's relevant. However, if the user had mentioned that gender identity is important for them, maybe the guy should have been upfront. But the user didn't ask about it either.\n\nAnother angle is consent and honesty. The guy didn't lie about his gender; he just didn't disclose it. Lying would mean he intentionally misrepresented himself, but if he didn't correct the assumption, it's different. The user felt lied to, but maybe that's because of the lack of communication rather than an active lie.\n\nThe user's reaction is about personal preference. The user is straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is their right. Choosing not to continue the relationship based on attraction is understandable. The user isn't being offensive by stating their preferences; everyone has different attractions.\n\nThe guy's anger and accusations might be due to feeling rejected or not respected. But if he knew the user was straight and didn't disclose his gender, he might have been taking a risk. However, the user had prior knowledge of his trans status and still wanted to be friends. Ending a romantic relationship isn't the same as being manipulative or evil; it's about personal feelings and compatibility.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the user isn't wrong for ending the relationship because their attraction is based on personal preferences. The guy didn't necessarily lie, just didn't disclose early. The user's decision to stop the relationship is valid. Also, the guy's response seems harsh and unjustified, which shifts blame away from the user.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
