He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction. They met at art school, became friends, then started dating. The issue came up when they found out the person is trans during a moment of intimacy. The user feels lied to because the person didn't disclose earlier. They're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they ended the relationship. The trans person is upset, calling them evil and manipulative, which is confusing the user.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The person didn't disclose their trans status early on. The user feels it's important for intimacy and didn't know how to handle it when they found out during a sexual moment. The user isn't being offensive; they're stating their orientation. The trans person might feel hurt because they were honest about their identity, but maybe the user didn't get the context until it was too late.\n\nBut wait, the trans person might have been open about their identity eventually. Maybe they were waiting for the right time or felt vulnerable. However, withholding such information until a sexual encounter could be seen as not respecting the other person's needs for full disclosure before intimacy. The user might not be in the wrong because everyone has the right to know such personal information before engaging in a physical relationship. However, it's possible the trans person had reasons for not disclosing earlier, like fear of rejection or not being ready to talk about it.\n\nThe user's reaction is about their own attraction and boundaries. They\u2019re not being discriminatory if they\u2019re upfront about their preferences. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or misunderstood. But the user isn't the one who withheld information; the trans person did. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because it's about their own comfort and honesty in intimacy. However, the user could have handled it more sensitively, but the core issue is the lack of disclosure. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong) because the user's reaction is based on their own feelings and the trans person didn't share their identity in a timely manner. The user isn't being evil for not continuing the relationship; they\u2019re respecting their own boundaries.\n"
