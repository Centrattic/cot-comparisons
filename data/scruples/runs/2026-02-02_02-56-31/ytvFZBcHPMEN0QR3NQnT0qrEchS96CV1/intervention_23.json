  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. So the user is asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The user met someone at art school, became friends, developed a romantic relationship, and things were progressing towards a physical relationship. During a moment of intimacy, the user discovered that their crush is trans, specifically that he has a vagina. The user then stopped the interaction because they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person is upset, calling the user evil and manipulative, leading the user to question their own actions.\n\nSo the main question is whether the user is in the wrong for ending the romantic relationship after discovering the trans identity. Let's break it down.\n\nThe user's argument is that they felt lied to because the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity earlier. They believed that gender is important for their attraction and that if the trans person had told them earlier, maybe they could have worked through it. But since the disclosure happened during a physical moment, the user's attraction faded. They want to remain friends but the trans person is upset and angry.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Gender identity is a personal matter, and when someone is trans, they might choose when to disclose that information. However, in a relationship where physical intimacy is involved, certain expectations exist. The user might feel that key information was withheld, affecting their ability to consent fully. But on the flip side, the trans person might have felt it was their right to self-disclose on their own terms, especially if they were in a relationship with someone they thought was attracted to them.\n\nThe user's stance is that they're straight and not attracted to vaginas. It's their personal preference, and there's no inherent wrong in that. However, the way the disclosure happened might be a point of contention. The user didn't know until the intimate moment, which could be seen as a lack of full disclosure by the trans person. \n\nBut here's the catch: the trans person's identity isn't a choice, and they might have been open about it earlier but the user didn't ask. Or maybe the trans person was in the process of transitioning and hadn't mentioned it yet. It's possible that the user didn't realize the importance of gender identity in their relationship until that moment.\n\nIn terms of consent and honesty, both parties have responsibilities. The trans person might have thought that the relationship was progressing naturally and that disclosure wasn't necessary until a certain point. The user, on the other hand, might believe that physical attributes are crucial to their attraction and that the trans person didn't provide that information in time.\n\nThe user is not necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship because their attraction is based on their own preferences. However, the way they expressed their feelings and the reaction from the trans person complicates things. The user might have been abrupt in their reaction, leading to hurt feelings. The trans person feeling called a \"sociopath\" by the user's side might be a miscommunication or a result of the emotional fallout.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the key is intent. If the user approached the situation with respect, honesty, and a desire to maintain the friendship, they might not be in the wrong. But if they were dismissive or judgmental, that's different. The user says they want to remain friends, which is a positive step. The trans person's anger could stem from feeling invalidated or rejected, which is a common reaction when someone's identity is not accepted.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to a vagina, as it's their personal preference. However, there's a nuance in how the disclosure was handled. But since the user is seeking to maintain the friendship and didn't act with malice, the answer leans towards them not being an asshole. The trans person's anger might be more about the emotional impact of rejection rather than the user's right to their feelings.\n"
