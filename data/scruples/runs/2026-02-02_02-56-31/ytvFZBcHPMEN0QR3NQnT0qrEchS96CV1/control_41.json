He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong after finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met someone at art school, became friends, then started dating. They were close, had intimate moments, and then during a near-sex situation, the author discovered the person is trans. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. Now the trans person is upset and called the author names.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points here are consent, disclosure, and attraction. The trans person didn't tell them earlier, but maybe they were waiting for the right time. However, the author didn't know, and when they found out, their attraction went away. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author is at fault for not continuing the relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for their feelings. People have preferences, and attraction is subjective. The trans person might have felt they needed to be honest eventually, but the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if their attraction is gone.\n\nThe trans person's reaction seems harsh\u2014calling the author evil and manipulative. That's not fair if the author is just being honest about their feelings. The author tried to maintain a friendship. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author wrong for ending the relationship based on attraction.\n\nAlso, the author didn't know the person was trans until that moment. The trans person didn't lie about their identity; maybe they were just waiting to disclose. The author isn't responsible for the trans person's feelings of rejection. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
