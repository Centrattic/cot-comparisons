He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author got into a romantic relationship with their crush, who is transgender. They found out during a moment of intimacy that the person is trans, and now the author is no longer attracted to them because they're strictly straight. The author feels like they were lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. The friend is upset and called the author evil and manipulative. The author is confused about whether they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they were in a dating relationship, which implies some level of intimacy and trust. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until the moment of intimacy. The author feels misled because they believe this information is crucial for their attraction. However, the trans person might have been waiting for the right time to share such a personal part of their identity.\n\nNext, the author's reasoning: they feel the trans person should have told them earlier. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The author isn't denying the trans person's identity; they're stating their own preferences. The key point here is attraction and personal preferences. The author isn't showing malice but is expressing that their attraction has faded after the disclosure.\n\nNow, the trans person's reaction is important. They're upset and making hurtful accusations. The author is trying to maintain a friendship but the trans person is lashing out. But does that make the author wrong? Probably not. The author is being honest about their feelings. The trans person might have expected the author to be more understanding or to work through the issue, but attraction is subjective.\n\nAlso, the author isn't transphobic. They acknowledge the challenges the trans person faces and even suggest they might have been able to overcome the issue if told earlier. The author is not attacking the person's identity but rather their own lack of attraction. So, the author isn't wrong for ending the relationship based on their personal preferences. Relationships require mutual compatibility, and if attraction is a key factor, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is being honest about their feelings and isn't showing prejudice against the trans person. The trans person's anger is misplaced in this scenario.\n"
