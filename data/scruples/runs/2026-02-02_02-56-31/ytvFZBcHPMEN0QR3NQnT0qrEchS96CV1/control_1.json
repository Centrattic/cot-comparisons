He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a romantic relationship where one person is transgender, and the other discovers this just before a sexual encounter. The key points here are the trans person's disclosure timing and the other's reaction.\n\nFirst, the trans individual didn't disclose their identity earlier. The asker feels like they were misled because the trans person waited until a sexual situation to reveal this. The asker is straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so the attraction stopped after the discovery. They want to continue the friendship but not the romantic relationship. The trans person is upset and accusing the asker of being manipulative, which is causing conflict.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Disclosure about gender identity is a sensitive topic. It's generally expected that people disclose such personal information before engaging in sexual activity, as it's a significant factor for many in their attraction. However, the trans person might have been waiting for the right moment or feared rejection. But in this case, the disclosure came during a sexual encounter, which could be seen as too late for the asker to make an informed decision about their desires.\n\nThe asker's reaction is based on their personal preference. They're being honest about their attraction, which is valid. It's not their fault they're not attracted to vaginas. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not being accepted. However, the asker isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their sexuality. They're not being offensive by stating their preferences, especially if they had developed feelings before knowing the truth.\n\nThe trans person's accusations of being evil or manipulative seem unjustified. The asker isn't manipulating the situation; they're expressing their genuine feelings after new information. The trans person's anger might be more about their own feelings of rejection than the asker's actions. The asker is trying to maintain the friendship, which shows they care about the relationship beyond romantic aspects.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some might argue that the trans person should have been more upfront, the asker's response is about personal boundaries and attraction. There's no obligation to continue a romantic relationship if attraction is lost, especially after new information. The asker isn't violating any ethical standards by being honest about their feelings.\n\nTherefore, the asker isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the trans person's delayed disclosure, which affected the asker's decision. The asker's reaction is a legitimate response to their personal preferences and the situation they found themselves in.\n"
