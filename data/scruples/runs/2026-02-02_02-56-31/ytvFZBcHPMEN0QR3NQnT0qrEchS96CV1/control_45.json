He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a crush who's trans, and the author isn't attracted anymore after finding out. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they started dating, got close, and then discovered the person is trans. They feel lied to because the person didn't disclose that earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. Now the trans person is upset and accused the author of being evil.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent to be trans and the author's right to their feelings. The trans person didn't hide their identity until the moment, but maybe they were waiting for the right time. But the author felt it was a lie because it wasn't mentioned earlier. However, the trans person might have felt ready to share when they were comfortable. \n\nBut the author is now choosing not to continue the relationship, which the trans person is taking as rejection and calling them names. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't being malicious; they just have different attractions. They want to stay friends, but the trans person is upset. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest about their feelings. Everyone has the right to their attractions. The trans person might have a right to feel hurt, but the author isn't at fault for not changing their preferences. So the answer is B.\n"
