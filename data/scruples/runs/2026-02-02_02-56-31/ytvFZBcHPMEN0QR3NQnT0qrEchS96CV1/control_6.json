He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a crush who is transgender, and the author losing attraction after finding out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author met someone, they became close friends, developed a romantic relationship, and during a sexual encounter, the author discovered the person is trans. The author then stopped the interaction, the trans person is upset, and the author is questioning their own actions.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after finding out the person is trans. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their lack of attraction is based on their sexual orientation. The trans person didn't disclose this information earlier, which the author feels is a lie or omission of important information.\n\nNow, I need to think about the ethical implications. In many cases, people disclose their gender identity at different times in a relationship. Some might do it early, others later. The author's problem is that they felt the trans person didn't tell them soon enough, leading to a situation where the author couldn't reconcile their attraction. \n\nBut the author is also in a position where their sexual orientation is clear. If they're strictly straight, then being attracted to a trans person (who may present as male but has a vagina) could be a conflict. The trans person might have expected the author to be okay with their identity, but the author's attraction is tied to physical characteristics. \n\nHowever, the trans person's decision to disclose their identity is a personal choice. The author is upset that it was revealed during a sexual situation, which might feel like a violation of trust. But was it the trans person's fault for not disclosing earlier? That's debatable. Some trans people choose to come out when they feel safe, and maybe they felt the relationship was moving forward and decided not to disclose until a more intimate moment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction of feeling lied to might be valid because the trans person didn't share that information upfront. But the author also had the choice to ask if they were unsure. Maybe the author should have considered that their partner might not be cisgender, but they didn't, so part of the responsibility is on them.\n\nThe trans person's anger towards the author for not continuing the relationship could be hurtful, but it's also their right to feel that way. The author is ending the relationship because of the trans person's gender, which could be seen as transphobic, but the author is being honest about their own feelings and not wanting to be in a relationship where they aren't attracted.\n\nThe key here is consent and honesty. The trans person is being honest about their identity, and the author is being honest about their attraction. The author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted, but they might need to consider how to communicate that without being offensive. However, the trans person's actions in not disclosing earlier could be a point of contention. But the author's reaction is based on their own orientation, which is a personal choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because they're being honest about their attraction. The trans person's disclosure timing was their choice, and while it's important, the author's feelings are valid. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
