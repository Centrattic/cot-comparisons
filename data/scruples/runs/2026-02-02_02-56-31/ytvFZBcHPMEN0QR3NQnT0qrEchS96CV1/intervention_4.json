He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for no longer being attracted to their crush after finding out he's trans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They started a relationship that was becoming romantic and physical. The user discovered their partner is trans during a moment of intimacy. The partner didn't disclose this earlier, and the user now feels like they were lied to because they're strictly straight. They want to stay friends but not be in a relationship, which upset the partner.\n\nNow, the user is wondering if they're the asshole here. The options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nI need to consider the key points here. The partner didn't disclose being trans, which the user considers important. The user's attraction hinges on the person having a penis. The partner might have felt the timing was right to come out, or maybe they were scared. But the user is now rejecting the relationship, leading to conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. The partner didn't come clean early, which could be seen as a lack of honesty. But the user's feelings are valid\u2014attraction is personal. The user isn't being manipulative; they're being honest about their preferences. The partner's reaction seems extreme, calling the user evil, which might indicate their own issues. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their attractions. The partner should have been honest earlier if that was a dealbreaker. The user is being truthful about their feelings, not malicious. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
