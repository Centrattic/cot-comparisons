He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions they were in a dating relationship that progressed to a point where they were about to have sex. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until that moment. The author feels lied to because they believe this information should have been shared earlier. They also state they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded after finding out. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative, which adds tension.\n\nLegally and ethically, in many places, being transgender is protected under anti-discrimination laws, but this is about a personal relationship. The author's main issue is about attraction based on gender identity. The trans person might have felt safe to disclose after building trust. However, the author argues that the trans person didn't share important information upfront, which affected the author's ability to consent to a sexual relationship.\n\nBut attraction is subjective. The author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone who presents as a different gender. They can't help their sexual orientation. The trans person's disclosure timing is debatable\u2014maybe they were waiting for the right moment or felt safe. However, withholding such a significant detail that impacts the relationship's nature could be seen as a problem. But the author didn't know the person was trans, so they couldn't have consented to a relationship with a vagina. \n\nThe author's actions after the disclosure\u2014stopping immediately and wanting to be friends\u2014show respect. The trans person's reaction of anger and calling the author names might indicate their hurt, but it doesn't make the author wrong. The author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if their attractions have changed. They didn't force anything and tried to maintain friendship. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to lack of attraction. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or hurt, but the author isn't the asshole here. They were honest once they knew the information, and their feelings are valid even if they prefer men.\n"
