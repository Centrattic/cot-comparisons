He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a romantic relationship where the author found out their crush is trans and then lost attraction. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their crush were good friends for months, started dating, and were about to have sex when the author discovered the person is trans. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they lost interest. The trans person is upset and called the author names, leading the author to question if they're an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The trans person didn't disclose their identity early on. However, the author also didn't ask about it during the months they were friends. The trans person might have chosen when to share such a personal aspect of their identity. On the other hand, the author felt the information was withheld, which is a valid concern because disclosure is important in relationships. But the author also admits that maybe if it was disclosed earlier, they could have overcome the attraction. \n\nThe author's main issue is about honesty and the timing of disclosure. But is the author in the wrong? They're not in a committed relationship yet; they were dating. The trans person might have felt it was their decision when to share. However, the author felt misled, which is a common issue in relationships when significant information isn't shared. \n\nThe author wants to continue the friendship but not the romantic relationship. The trans person is upset and called the author names, which could indicate their own hurt and possibly misdirected anger. The author isn't being malicious; they're stating their feelings and boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. But generally, people have the right to know about their partner's gender identity, especially as the relationship becomes more intimate. The trans person might have had the right to choose when to disclose, but withholding such a significant detail that affects the other person's attraction could be seen as not being fully honest. However, the author's reaction in ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong because they're not obligated to continue a relationship if they're not attracted. \n\nThe key here is whether the trans person was deceptive. If they presented as male and the author assumed they were cis, then perhaps there's a lack of disclosure. But the author also didn't ask. The author's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious; it's about personal preferences. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
