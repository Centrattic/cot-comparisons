He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they were dating someone they later found out was trans, and now they're not attracted to them anymore. The author is questioning if they're an asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity until the moment during a near-sex situation. The author feels lied to because they had months of getting to know each other and the trans person didn't bring it up earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded after the revelation. \n\nNow, the key points here are about honesty and when information is shared. The trans person might have been waiting until they felt safe or comfortable to share their identity, but in a romantic context, certain personal details are usually considered important early on. The author felt that the information was withheld until a critical moment, which made the trust issues. \n\nThe author isn't rejecting the person for who they are, but rather the specific aspect of their anatomy, which is a common issue in relationships. The trans person might have expected the author to be okay with their identity, but attraction is subjective. The author isn't being offensive but is honest about their preferences. \n\nThe trans person's reaction seems overly harsh, calling the author evil and manipulative, which isn't fair. The author is trying to maintain friendship but is rejected. The main question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship based on something they can't control (being straight) and a lack of prior disclosure. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest about their feelings and were not kept informed about an important aspect. The trans person's responsibility was to share that information earlier if it was a deal-breaker. The author's actions are about personal preference, not malice. So the answer is B.\n"
