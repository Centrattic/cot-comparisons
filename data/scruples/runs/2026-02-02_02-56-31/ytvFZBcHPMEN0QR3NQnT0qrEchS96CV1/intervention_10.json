  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. So, the question is about whether they're an asshole for not continuing the relationship after finding out their crush is trans.\n\nFirst, the user mentions they met someone at art school, became friends, and things developed into a romantic relationship. They didn't know the person was trans until a very intimate moment. The user feels lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. They are straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. The trans person is upset and called them names, but the user is confused about their fault.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are consent to the relationship, disclosure of identity, and the user's response. The trans person didn't tell them about their identity before becoming intimate. The user didn't know, so when they found out, they stopped the interaction. The user is questioning if they're in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and ethical perspectives. Being trans is a part of someone's identity, but whether it's necessary to disclose before a relationship becomes intimate can vary. Some people might think it's important to know early on, others might not. However, in this case, the trans person didn't disclose, and the user felt it was a lie. The user is straight, so their attraction is based on gender, which they now can't reconcile. \n\nBut wait, the user is not in the wrong for not being attracted to someone who is trans if they identify as straight. Sexual orientation is about attraction to certain genders, so if the person presents as male (even if trans), but the user is straight, maybe they would be attracted. However, if the user is strictly into cisgender men, then finding out the person is trans might change that. It's complicated because the trans person's gender identity is still male, but the user's attraction is based on biological factors. \n\nThe user's issue is about not being informed in a timely manner. The trans person waited until an intimate moment to reveal their identity, which the user found misleading. The user then stopped the interaction, which is a natural response if they feel deceived. The trans person's reaction of anger and calling the user names might indicate they felt rejected, but that doesn't make the user wrong for not wanting to continue. \n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships require honesty. If the trans person didn't disclose their identity, they might be at fault for not being upfront. The user's decision to end the relationship because of their sexual orientation isn't malicious. The user isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone who is trans if they identify as straight. They're not being malicious; it's about their genuine feelings. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The user isn't in the wrong. They were honest about their feelings once they found out. The trans person should have been upfront earlier. The user's attraction being based on gender doesn't make them an asshole for not wanting to proceed. Therefore, the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
