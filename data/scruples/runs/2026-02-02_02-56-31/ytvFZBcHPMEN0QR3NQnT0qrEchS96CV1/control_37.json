He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where one person found out their partner is trans and then lost interest. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author met someone, they became friends, then started dating. The author discovered the partner was trans during a moment of intimacy. The partner didn't disclose this earlier, and now the author feels they were lied to. The author isn't attracted to vaginas and feels that if the partner had told them earlier, they might have handled it differently. The partner is upset and claims the author is manipulative.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. The partner didn't disclose their trans status, which the author considers important. However, the author also admits they are straight and not attracted to vaginas. The partner might have felt they were in a relationship and didn't want to ruin it by coming out earlier, or maybe they felt the timing wasn't right. But the author argues that the partner should have told them before the relationship became physical.\n\nIn terms of ethics, both parties have responsibilities. The partner should have been honest about their identity, especially if it's a dealbreaker for the other person. However, the author is also being honest about their attractions. It's a situation where both might have missteps. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after the disclosure.\n\nThe key here is that the author is not rejecting the partner for being trans, but rather for the lack of disclosure. They're also clear about their orientation. The partner's anger and accusations of being evil might be overreactions. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after learning something they find important. So, the answer would be B for No.\n"
