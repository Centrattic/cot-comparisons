He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who found out their crush is trans and then lost attraction. They're wondering if they're the asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their crush were friends for months, developed a romantic relationship, and things were getting physical. The author discovered the person is trans during a moment where they were about to have sex. They feel lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier, and the author is straight, so they're not attracted to vaginas. Now, the trans person is upset and called the author names, leading to the author feeling confused about their actions.\n\nSo, the main questions are: Did the trans person have an obligation to disclose their gender identity earlier? Is the author wrong for losing attraction and ending the relationship? And is the author being manipulative or evil for doing so?\n\nI know that gender identity is a personal aspect, and when it comes to relationships, honesty is important. However, the trans person might not have felt safe to disclose it earlier, especially if they were concerned about rejection. But at the same time, if someone is seeking a romantic relationship, certain personal details like gender identity might be considered important to share before getting too involved physically and emotionally.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation. They're straight and not attracted to vaginas. So, the attraction isn't there now that they know. But they were in a relationship with someone who they now realize is trans. The author is confused because maybe if the trans person had told them earlier, they could have made a different decision. But since the disclosure happened during a physical moment, it might have felt like a surprise, leading to the loss of attraction.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and trans rights, it's important to recognize that trans people have the right to self-identify and may choose when to disclose their status. However, in a romantic context, full disclosure is part of mutual honesty. If the trans person didn't mention it despite knowing the relationship was becoming physical, maybe they should have brought it up earlier. On the other hand, the author might not be in the wrong for not wanting to continue a relationship where their attraction is based on the partner's gender identity, which they found out later.\n\nThe author isn't being manipulative; they're expressing their feelings based on their orientation. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or hurt, but that doesn't necessarily make the author the one at fault. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because their attraction is genuine and based on their orientation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author's feelings and actions are based on their sexual orientation and the information they received. The trans person might have some responsibility in disclosing their identity earlier, but the author isn't the asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n"
