He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author had been in a relationship with someone they met at art school. The guy turned out to be trans, and when the author found out during a near-sexual encounter, they felt their attraction disappeared. The guy got angry and accused the author of being manipulative. The author is now asking if they're an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. They mention they might have been able to overcome their initial feelings if told earlier. But since the trans guy didn't disclose this until the moment, the author's attraction faded. They want to remain friends, but the guy is upset and angry.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The main ethical considerations here involve consent, honesty, and mutual respect in relationships. The trans guy, if he's male-presenting and identifies as male, might not have felt the need to disclose his trans status upfront. However, if there's a point where certain physical aspects become relevant (like genitalia during intimacy), not disclosing could be a problem. But wait, if he's a trans man with a vagina, then technically he is a woman biologically, but if he's been living as male and the author is straight, then the author's attraction was to a man. If the author didn't know his trans status, then perhaps there's a lack of information. However, if the author is strictly not attracted to vaginas, and the guy has a vagina, then the author is not in the wrong for realizing their attraction is not there. \n\nBut another angle is whether the trans person should have disclosed his status earlier. If the author's attraction depends on the presence of a penis, and the guy is a trans man with a vagina, then the author is not in the wrong for being honest about their attraction. The author is not making a moral judgment about trans people but about their own preferences. However, the way the author discovered this might affect how they perceive the situation. If the guy didn't disclose, maybe he had a responsibility to do so when the relationship became intimate. On the other hand, the author might not have considered this aspect before proceeding. \n\nThe guy's reaction being angry and calling the author names suggests poor communication and possible emotional manipulation. The author is trying to be honest about their feelings, which is generally the right approach. So, in terms of the author being in the wrong, it seems they are not. They have the right to be honest about their attraction. The main issue might be on the trans guy's side for not disclosing earlier if that's a necessary part of the relationship. But since the author is asking if they're the asshole, the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
