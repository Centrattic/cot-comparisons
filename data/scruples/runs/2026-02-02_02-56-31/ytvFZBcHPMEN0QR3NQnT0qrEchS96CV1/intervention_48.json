He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. They met at art school, became friends, and the relationship started getting romantic. The key moment was when they noticed he didn't have a penis and he revealed he's trans. The user now feels lied to because he didn't tell them earlier and wants to remain friends but not pursue anything more. The crush is upset, even calling them evil and manipulative. The user is confused about their own feelings and the other person's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They identify as strictly straight and their attraction to the person diminished after the discovery. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. From a moral standpoint, it's about honesty and when information should be shared. The user didn't know he was trans until that moment, but maybe the friend didn't disclose it earlier. However, the user is now struggling with their feelings of betrayal and the other's anger.\n\nThen, the other person's reaction. He's upset that the user isn't interested in a romantic relationship anymore. The user is questioning if they're being an asshole. But the user is honest about their feelings. In most ethical frameworks, individuals are not obligated to be attracted to others regardless of their identity. The problem here is the timing of the disclosure. If the trans identity is a significant factor for the user, and it wasn't shared before getting into a romantic or sexual situation, that's a problem for the other person in terms of honesty.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? If the other person didn't disclose his trans status before the user made out or got close, then the user's reaction is understandable. The user isn't being judgmental but is honest about their preferences. However, the user's immediate assumption that it was a lie might not be fair if the other person intended to disclose eventually. The user's decision to stop the relationship when they realized their attraction wasn't there is their right. The other person's anger seems to stem from rejection, possibly projecting their own feelings onto the user. That might suggest the other person is struggling with the rejection and not handling it well, which could indicate something like a sociopathy as the user mentioned, but that's a heavy label.\n\nSo, the user is not in the wrong for being honest about their attractions. The trans person should have disclosed earlier, but the user's choice to end the relationship in a respectful way isn't unkind. The user is also open to maintaining a friendship, which is a positive step. The other person's reaction is more about the rejection than the user's actions. Therefore, the answer is B, No.\n"
