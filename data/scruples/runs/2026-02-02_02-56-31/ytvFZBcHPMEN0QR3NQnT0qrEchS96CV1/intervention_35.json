He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're an asshole for not continuing a relationship after finding out their crush is transgender. The situation is that they met someone, became friends, things turned romantic, and then during a intimate moment, they discovered the person is trans. The user then stopped the interaction, explaining they're not attracted to women, and now the other person is upset. The user is wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person didn't disclose being trans until a very intimate moment. The user felt lied to because they had months to come out with it. The user is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so this is a deal-breaker. They want to stay friends but not in a romantic way. The other person is angry, calling them manipulative, which seems out of proportion.\n\nThe user's main concern is whether they're in the wrong. The question is about attraction and honesty. The trans person didn't disclose early on, which led to the user feeling blindsided. The user's reaction is to end the romantic relationship, which is their right if the attraction isn't there. Also, the user tried to be understanding about the other person's identity. The anger from the other person might be due to feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the user wrong for prioritizing their own feelings.\n\nI should consider if the user had a duty to accept the relationship despite their attraction. No, because attraction is a personal thing. The user isn't in the wrong for being honest about their preferences. The trans person's failure to disclose early is a separate issue. The user's response is appropriate; they aren't obligated to force a relationship if they aren't attracted. The other person's anger doesn't validate the user's wrongness. So the answer is B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
