He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person found out their crush is trans and is no longer attracted to them, leading to the end of the relationship. The key points here are about honesty, attraction, and the dynamics of the relationship.\n\nFirst, the trans guy didn't disclose his gender identity until after they were dating, which the author feels was a lie. The author is strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the physical aspect of the relationship is a deal-breaker. The trans guy is upset and called the author names, which is problematic. \n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong to end the relationship. The author didn't know the person's gender identity, which is a significant factor in their attraction. The trans person waited until the moment before sex to reveal this, which might be seen as withholding important information. However, the author might have a right to feel misled if the trans person didn't disclose earlier. But it's also possible the trans person was waiting for the right time or felt vulnerable enough to share during that moment. \n\nThe author's reaction is to stop the relationship, which is understandable if they're not attracted anymore. They want to stay friends, but the trans person is upset and accused them of being manipulative, which is unfair. The author isn't in the wrong for not continuing a relationship where attraction is lacking. They're not obligated to stay in a relationship that doesn't meet their needs. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The trans person might have been better to disclose earlier, but the author's decision to end the relationship isn't their fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
