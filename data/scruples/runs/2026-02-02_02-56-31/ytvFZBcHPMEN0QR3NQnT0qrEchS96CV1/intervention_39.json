  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. First, I need to consider the context. The person in the question was in a romantic relationship with someone who didn't disclose being trans until a very intimate moment. The user feels they were lied to because the trans person didn't come out earlier. They identify as straight and aren't attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. The trans person is upset and called them names.\n\nSo, the main issues here are deception, attraction, and the dynamics of the relationship. The user is asking if they're wrong for not continuing the relationship. \n\nFirst, it's important to note that being trans is a part of someone's identity, and it's generally considered respectful to disclose that information before entering into a romantic or sexual relationship. The trans person had the opportunity to share this earlier but chose not to, which could be seen as deceptive. The user then felt they were misled, which is a valid feeling.\n\nHowever, the user is also making a judgment about their own sexuality. They state they are strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's their personal preference, and it's okay for someone to have certain attractions. The problem here isn't the user's attraction but the timing and disclosure of the trans person's identity.\n\nNow, the user is trying to maintain a friendship, but the trans person is angry and upset. The user isn't looking to continue the relationship, which is their right. They aren't obligated to stay in a relationship if their feelings have changed. The trans person's reaction might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the user at fault for not wanting to pursue a romantic relationship anymore.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility of both parties in a relationship to be honest about their identities. The trans person might have had their reasons for not disclosing earlier, but withholding such a significant detail can impact the trust in the relationship. The user's decision to end the romantic aspect isn't malicious; it's based on their personal attractions and the late disclosure of information that's important to them.\n\nThere's also a consideration of the trans person's experience. Transitioning and coming out can be difficult, and some might wait until a certain point to reveal their identity. However, in a romantic context, honesty is crucial. The user's reaction is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nIn summary, the user isn't in the wrong for ending the romantic relationship after discovering something they considered important, especially if it was withheld. Their attraction is a personal matter, and they have the right to be honest about their preferences. The trans person's anger might be more about feeling rejected than the user's actions being inherently wrong.\n"
