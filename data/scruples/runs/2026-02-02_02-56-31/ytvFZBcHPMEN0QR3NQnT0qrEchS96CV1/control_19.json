He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering their crush is trans and then losing attraction, leading to a broken relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their crush were in a romantic relationship that started as friends. The author found out the person is trans during a sexual encounter. The author feels lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. The author identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so they can't continue the relationship. The crush is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative, which the author finds confusing.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't know the person was trans until the moment they were about to have sex. The person had months to disclose this information. The author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation\u2014being strictly straight. They want to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship. The person is taking it personally, accusing the author of being manipulative, which seems like a projection.\n\nFrom a ethical standpoint, the person who is trans might have had the right to disclose their identity at a time they felt comfortable. However, in a romantic context, certain personal details are typically shared before intimacy. The author's attraction being tied to having a penis is a personal preference. It's not inherently wrong to have such preferences, though it's important to respect others' identities.\n\nThe author isn't lying or being deceptive. They acted based on their feelings and sexual orientation. The trans person might have wanted to build a connection before disclosing, which can be understandable. But withholding such significant information that affects the relationship's direction could be an issue. However, the author isn't at fault for not wanting to proceed after learning the truth. They are honest about their preferences and want to maintain a friendship.\n\nThe trans person's reaction of calling the author evil seems harsh and possibly an attempt to deflect their own hurt. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own feelings and boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
