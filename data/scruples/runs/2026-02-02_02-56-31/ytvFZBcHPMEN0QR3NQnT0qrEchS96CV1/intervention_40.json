He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for no longer being attracted to their crush after finding out he's trans. Hmm, first, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe user met someone at art school, became friends, then started dating. They were getting close to having sex when the user discovered the person was trans. The user feels like they were lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. They're not attracted to vaginas and prefer penises, so their attraction faded. The trans person is upset and accused the user of being evil. The user is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are attraction, disclosure, and mutual respect in a relationship. Let's break it down. The user is straight and not attracted to vaginas. They didn't know the person was trans until that moment. The trans person didn't mention it earlier, which the user feels was a lie. The user then stopped the relationship, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. First, the trans person might have had the right to privacy regarding their identity. However, in a romantic context, certain personal details are typically shared. But when is the right time to disclose such information? It's a sensitive issue. If the trans person felt comfortable sharing when they did, maybe they were waiting for the right moment or felt it was too soon earlier. But if the user needed that information to feel comfortable pursuing a romantic relationship, then the trans person might have a point about withholding it.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's reaction is about their personal preference. They're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's their orientation, and they shouldn't be blamed for that. But did they have a right to expect that information earlier? The user might argue that the trans person should have mentioned it sooner, but the trans person might have felt it was their choice when to disclose.\n\nThe user stopped the relationship after discovering the truth. Is that wrong? If the user wasn't attracted to the person after knowing their gender identity, it's their right to end the relationship. However, the way they ended it might have been abrupt. The user went into the situation thinking the person was cisgender, so they weren't in the wrong for that assumption. But the trans person might have felt misled because the user didn't know beforehand.\n\nThe user is now being called names by the trans person, which is hurtful. That's a red flag. If the trans person is accusing the user of faking friendship, that's not healthy. The user's decision to end the relationship isn't necessarily manipulative. They're acting based on their feelings and orientation. It's possible that the user is not in the wrong here, especially if the trans person didn't disclose the information when it was important for the user to know.\n\nBut is there a possibility the user could have handled it better? Maybe approaching the situation with more empathy or understanding. However, the user's main issue is their attraction, which is a personal preference. They can't be blamed for that. The trans person might need to accept that the user isn't attracted to them now, even though they were friends.\n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, both parties have some. The trans person could have shared their identity earlier if it was crucial for the user. The user might have needed to process the information differently. But ultimately, the user isn't in the wrong for not being attracted after the fact. They're not obligated to continue a relationship if they don't feel the same way after knowing the truth. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
