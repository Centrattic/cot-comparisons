He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a crush on a guy they met at art school. They became friends, developed a relationship that was almost like dating, with make-out sessions and stuff. Then during a moment where things were getting physical, the author discovered the guy was trans and didn't have a penis. The author then stopped the interaction, felt lied to because the guy didn't tell them earlier, and now the relationship is over. The guy is upset and called the author names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship because the guy is trans. The key points here are about honesty, timing of disclosure, and attraction. The author feels that the guy didn't disclose his trans identity early enough, leading to a sense of being lied to. But when is the right time to share such personal information? Typically, people might share their gender identity early in a relationship, especially if it's important to their potential partner. However, there's no strict rule on when exactly that should happen. The guy might have felt more comfortable sharing later, or maybe the author would have reacted poorly if told earlier.\n\nThe author mentions that they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. So their attraction is based on the presence of a penis. Since the guy is trans, perhaps he has a vagina, so the author's attraction isn't there. That's a personal preference, and it's not inherently wrong to have those preferences. People have different things they're attracted to, and that's okay. However, the author is now facing the fact that they can't be in a relationship with someone they find unattractive, even though they liked the person otherwise.\n\nBut the author is also questioning if they're in the wrong for ending the relationship. They did stop the interaction once they found out, which shows they weren't pushy. The guy, on the other hand, is upset and called the author names, which might indicate that he feels rejected and is taking it personally. But is the author to blame for having different attraction needs?\n\nAnother angle is the guy's responsibility to disclose. If the guy had told the author earlier, maybe the author could have adjusted their feelings, but they still might have decided not to pursue a relationship. The author's problem is that the information came at a bad time, right before a physical encounter. However, the guy might have felt that the right time wasn't earlier, or perhaps he wasn't ready to share. Either way, the author isn't obligated to be in a relationship with someone they find unattractive, even if they like other aspects of them.\n\nAlso, the author isn't being offensive, just stating their preference. They're not saying trans people are bad, just that their attraction is to men with penises. That's a personal preference, not a judgment on the guy's identity. The guy's reaction seems more about feeling rejected and possibly hurt by the author's decision, but that doesn't make the author wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nSo putting this all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to end the relationship based on their personal preferences. The guy's anger might be misplaced, as the author is honest about their needs. The problem isn't with the author for not continuing the relationship but rather the guy's inability to accept the author's boundaries.\n"
