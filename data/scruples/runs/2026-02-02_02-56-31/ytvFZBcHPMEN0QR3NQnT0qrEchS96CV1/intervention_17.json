He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not being attracted to their crush after finding out he's trans. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe user and their crush were friends for months, grew close, and started a romantic relationship with physical intimacy. The user found out the person is trans during a moment of intimacy. The user feels like they were lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. They feel they're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they can't continue the relationship. The crush is upset and accused them of being evil and manipulative.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider both sides. \n\nFirst, from the user's perspective: They believed they were in a relationship with someone they thought was male. Discovering the person is trans during a sexual encounter might feel like a significant revelation. They're not attracted to vaginas and feel the person should have been honest earlier. They want to maintain friendship but not a romantic relationship. \n\nFrom the crush's perspective: They might feel that the user is rejecting them based on their gender identity, which could be seen as discriminatory. The user waited until the sexual encounter to question their identity. The crush might feel hurt and betrayed, especially if they felt they were being open about their identity. The accusations of being manipulative and fake friendship could indicate emotional distress.\n\nNow, considering societal and ethical perspectives: It's important to recognize that being transgender is a fundamental aspect of someone's identity. However, honesty in relationships is also crucial. If the user's crush didn't disclose their trans status early on, especially regarding physical expectations, that's a valid concern. On the other hand, the user's preference for a different gender might be a matter of personal orientation, and it's not necessarily wrong to have those preferences.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of when the information was shared. The user's crush might have felt comfortable sharing their identity at their own pace, but if the user had certain expectations about their partner's anatomy, that's something that should be discussed before becoming physically intimate. The user might have a right to know about their partner's identity before engaging in sexual activity.\n\nHowever, the user's reaction\u2014stopping the relationship after finding out\u2014might be seen as invalidating the person's identity, especially if the person had been open about being trans. The user's statement about being strictly straight and not being attracted to vaginas could be viewed as transphobic. It's important to distinguish between personal preference and prejudice. If the user is not attracted to vaginas, that's their orientation, but reacting negatively because someone is trans (even if they're transitioning) could be problematic.\n\nBut the user's crush did not disclose this information earlier. If the user had asked about their partner's anatomy before becoming intimate, they might have felt more informed. However, expecting someone to disclose their trans status before a relationship becomes physical is a complex issue. The user might have assumed their partner was cisgender, which is a common assumption unless there's prior knowledge.\n\nIn terms of ethics, both parties have valid points. The user is being honest about their preferences, but the timing and context of the disclosure matter. The user's crush might have felt it was their right to share their identity on their terms, but if the user's expectations about their partner's anatomy were not met, that's a conflict in the relationship.\n\nThe user's decision to end the relationship isn't inherently wrong, but the way they handled it might have been hurtful. The accusation of being evil and manipulative by the crush is extreme, but the user's actions might have contributed to the hurt. However, the user isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone who is trans. It's a matter of personal preference, not a moral failing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to their attraction being based on the wrong gender. However, they could have approached the situation more sensitively, but that doesn't make them the asshole. The key is that it's about personal orientation and the other person's failure to disclose in a timely manner. Therefore, the answer is B: No, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
