He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to their trans crush after finding out. The situation is the author started dating someone they thought was male, but later found out he's trans. Now they're not attracted and the relationship ended, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier. The author feels lied to because the person didn't come out sooner. But was there an obligation for the trans person to reveal this earlier?\n\nFrom a general perspective, people have the right to their identity and should be able to express it. However, the author is confused because they wanted a penis and now feel the situation wasn't honest. The trans person might have felt insecure or not ready to disclose that information. But the author is now questioning if they're in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attraction is subjective. The author isn't being malicious, but they have specific preferences. The trans person might have felt pressured to hide their identity to pursue the relationship. However, withholding such a personal detail can lead to issues if it's a dealbreaker for the other person.\n\nLegal and ethical aspects depend on the country, but generally, being trans is a protected identity. The author isn't wrong for having preferences, but the trans person could have been upfront earlier if that was important. However, relationships are complex, and people often don't disclose everything upfront. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014feeling lied to\u2014might be more about the timing rather than the information itself. The key point is whether the trans person intentionally misled. If he didn't hide it and it was revealed during intimacy, maybe he didn't mean to deceive. But the author's confusion is valid because it's a significant detail for them.\n\nUltimately, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to attraction. They expressed their feelings and want to remain friends. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't manipulating them. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
