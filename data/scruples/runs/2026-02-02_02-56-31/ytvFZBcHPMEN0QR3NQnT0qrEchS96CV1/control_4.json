He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where the author discovers their partner is trans, leading to a loss of attraction and the end of the relationship. The author is questioning if they're being an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author met someone they found attractive, and they started dating. During a near-sex encounter, the author discovered the partner was trans. The partner didn't disclose this earlier, which the author feels was a significant omission. The author now doesn't feel attracted anymore and wants to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship. The partner is upset and accused the author of being manipulative, but the author is confused about their own actions.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after this discovery. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. They mention that if the partner had told them earlier, maybe they could have worked through it, but since it was revealed at a critical moment, their attraction faded. Also, the partner is upset and called the author names, which complicates things.\n\nI need to think about consent and honesty in relationships. The partner didn't disclose their trans status initially, which could be seen as a lack of transparency. However, trans people often face societal pressures and may choose when to come out, especially in a romantic context. The author's reaction is based on their own sexual orientation, which is valid. But the timing and context of the disclosure might be a factor. The partner could have chosen to come out earlier, but it's not clear why they didn't. \n\nThe author's feelings of being lied to might stem from the partner not being open about their body. However, everyone has the right to self-identify and choose when to share personal information. The author is not in the wrong for their feelings of attraction; they can't control their sexual orientation. Ending a relationship because of a fundamental aspect of someone's identity isn't typically seen as being an asshole, especially if it's based on personal preferences. \n\nThe partner's anger and accusations might suggest they had expectations that weren't met, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. The author handled it by stopping the physical intimacy and wanting to remain friends, which shows a desire to be respectful. The key here is mutual respect and understanding. The author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if they're not attracted. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
