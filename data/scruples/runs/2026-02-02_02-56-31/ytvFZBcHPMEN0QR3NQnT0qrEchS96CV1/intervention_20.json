He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not being attracted to their trans crush after finding out he's trans. Let me unpack this.\n\nFirst, the situation: They met their crush at art school, became friends, then developed a romantic relationship. The user is strictly straight, so when they found out the person was trans (assigned female at birth), their attraction faded. The key issue here is whether the trans person withheld information and if the user is wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nThe user feels lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans status earlier. The person in question didn't come out until during an intimate moment. The user is now facing backlash, with the crush accusing them of being manipulative. The user is questioning their own actions.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and social aspects. Being trans is a fundamental part of someone's identity. However, when does someone disclose that? If it's a deal-breaker for someone, they might expect the person to know upfront. But the trans person might have felt they needed to build trust first. But withholding such a significant detail until the point of intimacy could be seen as not being honest, even if they were trying to be cautious.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is also responsible for their own feelings. If they're strictly straight, they can't be attracted to someone who doesn't have a penis. It's not their fault they have those preferences. They didn't know until that moment, so it's not like they were deliberately avoiding it.\n\nThe user is not in the wrong for ending the relationship because their attraction is based on their sexual orientation. However, the way the situation was handled\u2014finding out during an intimate moment\u2014could be problematic. The trans person should have been honest earlier if that information would affect the relationship. But the user's reaction isn't malicious; they're being honest about their feelings.\n\nThe accusations from the trans person that the user is manipulative seem unfair. The user tried to maintain a friendship and was honest about their feelings. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the user wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong. They acted based on their genuine feelings and preferences. The responsibility for the lack of disclosure lies with the trans person if they needed to share that information earlier.\n"
