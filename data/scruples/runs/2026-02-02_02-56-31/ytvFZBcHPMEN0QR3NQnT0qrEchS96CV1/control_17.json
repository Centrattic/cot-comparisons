He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask the Animal (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where one person found out their partner is trans and subsequently lost attraction, leading to the breakup. The person is feeling guilty and is being accused by their ex of being evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author met someone at art school, they became friends, developed a romantic relationship, and during an intimate moment, the author discovered their partner is trans. The author isn't attracted to people assigned female at birth and now wants to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship. The ex is upset and accusing the author of being manipulative.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author isn't in the wrong if they were honest about their preferences. However, the situation is complicated because the partner didn't disclose their trans status earlier. But the author also didn't ask about their partner's anatomy before the relationship became physical. The author's argument is that they're straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is a valid personal preference. However, the timing of the disclosure and the author's reaction might affect the perception of fault.\n\nIn many cases, if someone is trans and hasn't shared that yet because they're not out, it's their choice to make when to disclose. But in a romantic context, certain details might be expected to be known by both parties, especially as the relationship becomes intimate. The author might have a right to their feelings if they believed they were dating a cis man and later found out otherwise. However, the author's attraction being solely based on gender might be seen as problematic, but that's a personal preference.\n\nThe ex's reaction is also a factor. Accusing the author of being manipulative without considering the author's lack of attraction could be seen as unfair. The author isn't forcing the relationship; they're ending it due to lack of attraction, which isn't their fault. However, the manner in which the author handled the situation could be scrutinized. Were they explicit about their preferences earlier? Did they have communication issues?\n\nOverall, the author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to a trans person if that's their preference. The responsibility for disclosure lies with the trans partner, but the author also has the right to their own preferences. The key here is that attraction is subjective, and the author isn't lying about their feelings. The ex's accusations of being evil and manipulative are likely a defensive reaction, not a valid critique of the author's actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
