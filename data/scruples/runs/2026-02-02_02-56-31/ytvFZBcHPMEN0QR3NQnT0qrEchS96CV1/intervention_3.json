  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after discovering their crush is trans and losing attraction. First, I need to understand the situation from both sides.\n\nThe user met someone at art school, became friends, and started dating. They developed romantic feelings, but when they found out the person is trans during a sexual encounter, their attraction faded. The user feels lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. They want to stay friends but not pursue a relationship, while the other person is upset and accused them of being evil. The user is confused about whether they're wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nNow, thinking about the key points here. The main issue is the disclosure of being trans. The user believes that not disclosing such an important aspect before a sexual encounter was a lie, which affects their ability to consent properly. Consent requires full disclosure of relevant information, especially regarding anatomy if it's a dealbreaker. The user identifies as straight and not attracted to vaginas, so this is a significant factor.\n\nBut trans people are people too, and their identity is valid. However, in relationships where gender is a dealbreaker, disclosure is important. The user isn't being bigoted for their preferences, as it's okay to have personal boundaries. The problem might be that the person didn't share their identity earlier, leading to confusion and a lack of informed consent. The user isn't the one who misrepresented their identity; they were honest about their feelings. The other person's reaction seems extreme, but it's possible they were afraid of rejection.\n\nOn the other hand, the user should consider that some trans people might not feel ready to disclose until they feel safe. However, in a situation where gender is a significant factor, not knowing could affect the relationship's foundation. The user isn't wrong for having boundaries and not wanting to continue if they're not attracted. Ending the relationship because of a valid, honest preference isn't being an asshole. The other person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or unaccepted, but that doesn't make the user wrong for their feelings.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the user isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to a lack of attraction after learning something they considered important. They aren't being offensive for their sexual orientation. The trans person's failure to disclose earlier might be a point of contention, but the user's response is valid. Therefore, the answer is B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
