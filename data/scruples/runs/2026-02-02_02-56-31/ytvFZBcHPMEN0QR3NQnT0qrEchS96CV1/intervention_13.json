  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong after finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction. They met at art school, became friends, then started dating. The issue came up when they noticed the person wasn't male during a sexual encounter. The trans person didn't disclose this earlier, and now the user feels lied to. They're confused about their feelings and whether they're being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The trans person might have struggled with coming out. Disclosing one's gender identity can be really tough, especially in a new relationship. But the user is straight and wasn't attracted to a vagina. The trans person's silence might have been an oversight, but it's important to note that they might have wanted to build trust first. However, withholding such a significant detail before intimacy could be seen as not being transparent.\n\nThe user's reaction is about their own attraction. They're not in the wrong for feeling that way. Being straight is a valid orientation. The user didn't force the relationship; it developed naturally. The trans person might have felt ready to share their identity when they did, but the user feels misled because the disclosure came at a critical moment. \n\nThe user is now ending the relationship, which is their right. The trans person's anger and accusations could be due to hurt feelings or feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the user wrong. The key here is consent and honesty from both sides. The user acted on their feelings once they had all the information, even if it was unexpected. So, the user isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their lack of attraction. Answer B.\n"
