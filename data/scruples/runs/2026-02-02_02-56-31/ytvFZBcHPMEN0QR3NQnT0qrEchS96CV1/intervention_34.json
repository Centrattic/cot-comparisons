  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for finding out my crush is trans and not being attracted to him anymore?\nI started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who asked this question is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a person who started attending art school and met someone they found very attractive and with whom they developed a close relationship. They became good friends, started dating, and their relationship was progressing romantically. During a moment when they were about to have sex, the user discovered that their crush is transgender (specifically, assigned female at birth but identifies as male). The user then felt lied to, thinking that the person didn't disclose this important aspect of their identity in time. The user is strictly straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, but they might have been able to overcome this if the person had been honest earlier. Now, the trans person is upset and angry, calling the user evil and manipulative, which has left the user feeling confused and wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the disclosure. The user mentions that the trans person had months to tell them about their identity. The user felt that this information was withheld until a very intimate moment, which led to a breakdown in the relationship. The user is now questioning if it's their fault for not continuing the relationship, especially since they identify as straight. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The trans person's disclosure timing, 2) The user's attraction based on their sexuality, and 3) The resulting conflict and accusations between them.\n\nIn terms of the user's actions, they express regret about not being attracted to the person after the disclosure, but they also mention wanting to remain friends. They feel that they were honest about their feelings once they realized the trans person's identity. However, the trans person is upset and is making accusations against the user. The user is now questioning their own actions.\n\nFrom a general perspective, people have the right to know certain information about their partners in a relationship, especially regarding aspects that affect their physical intimacy. However, the trans person's identity is a part of who they are, and it's not something they can change. The user's reaction is based on their personal sexual orientation, which is valid. However, the user might need to consider that the trans person's decision to not disclose earlier could be due to fear of rejection or other personal reasons, which isn't the user's fault.\n\nThe user is not in the wrong for feeling unattracted to someone who is of a different gender in their eyes after learning about the trans person's identity. It's their right to have certain preferences. However, the way the user approached the situation\u2014stopping the intimate act and then ending the relationship\u2014might have been abrupt, but it's understandable given their feelings. The trans person's anger and accusations might be more about their own feelings of rejection rather than the user's wrongdoing. \n\nIt's also important to note that the user isn't being discriminatory for being attracted to men specifically, as long as they're respectful of the trans person's identity. The user's issue is about personal attraction, which is a valid aspect of relationships. So, the user isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after the disclosure. The trans person is responsible for not disclosing earlier, which could have affected the user's ability to process the information. Therefore, the answer would be that the user is not in the wrong.\n"
