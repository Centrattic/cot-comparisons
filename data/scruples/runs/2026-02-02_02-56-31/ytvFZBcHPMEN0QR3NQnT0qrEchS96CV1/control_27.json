He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who found out his crush is trans and lost interest because he's strictly straight. Now the trans person is upset and called him names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author met someone, they became friends, things turned romantic, and during a sexual encounter, the author discovered the person was trans. The author feels like he wasn't told upfront and that this changed his attraction. The trans person is upset and accuses the author of being manipulative.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after finding out about the trans identity? \n\nFrom a standpoint of ethics and relationships, honesty is usually important. The trans person might have felt that their identity was something significant to discuss, but the timing and manner in which it was revealed could be a point of contention. However, the author states that the person had months to disclose this and chose not to. The author is now expressing that he's not attracted to vaginas and is not interested in continuing the relationship. \n\nThere's a debate here about when personal information should be disclosed. Some might argue that gender identity is a fundamental aspect of oneself and should be shared sooner, especially in a romantic context. Others might say that physical attraction can change upon knowing certain truths, and the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way.\n\nThe trans person is now upset and making accusations, which complicates things. The author is defending his right to be honest about his attractions and not wanting to continue the relationship. He's also trying to maintain a friendship, which shows he's not trying to be malicious.\n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a growing emphasis on respecting trans people's identities and the importance of self-disclosure in relationships. However, the author's reaction is based on his own sexuality. Being straight means he's not attracted to men, and in this case, the trans person may present as male but has a vagina. The author is honest about his preferences, which doesn't make him wrong, but it's a matter of personal choice.\n\nI need to weigh the importance of honesty in relationships against the author's right to his feelings. The author didn't hide his feelings; he was upfront about his attraction changing. The trans person might have felt hurt because their identity was rejected, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for not being attracted anymore.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. His reaction is based on his own sexuality, and while he might feel bad for the impact on his friend, he's not being manipulative or evil. The key here is that both parties have different expectations and reactions, and the author is being honest about his feelings.\n"
