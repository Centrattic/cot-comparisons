He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author developed a romantic relationship with someone they later found out was trans. The author is now not attracted to them anymore and wants to remain friends, but the trans person is upset and accuses the author of being evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they only realized the person was trans when they were about to have sex. They felt lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they lost attraction. They want to stay friends but the other person is angry.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. The person they were dating is trans, which is part of their identity. However, the author didn't know this until they were physically intimate. The trans person might have had reasons for not disclosing earlier, maybe due to fear of rejection or not seeing it as relevant. But the author feels misled because they consider gender identity crucial to their attraction.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to their own preferences in relationships. The author isn't being offensive about trans people; they're stating their sexual orientation. The trans person might have a right to expect honesty from the author, but the author didn't know the person was trans. However, the trans person could have been honest earlier if gender identity was important to them. The author is now facing a change in their feelings, which is a natural reaction when they discover something they consider important later in the relationship.\n\nThe other person's anger and accusations might be more about their own feelings of rejection rather than the author's actions. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their preferences. They're not discriminating against trans people, just stating that their attraction is based on specific factors. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
