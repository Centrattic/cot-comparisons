He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they are in the wrong for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. They felt lied to because he didn't disclose his trans status earlier. They were in a dating-like relationship, and when they found out during a sexual encounter, they pulled back. Now the crush is upset and accused them of being evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user identifies as straight, so attraction to a trans man might be an issue if they're specifically into cisgender men. The trans man didn't disclose his status, which the user found out during a sexual situation. The user felt misled and stopped pursuing the relationship, which upset the other person.\n\nLegally and ethically, when it comes to relationships, people are generally expected to be honest about their identity. However, trans people might not always disclose if they pass as cisgender, especially if they don't feel it's relevant yet. But in a romantic context, certain personal details might be considered important to share. However, this depends on the individual's perspective.\n\nThe user's reaction is based on their own preferences. They mentioned that maybe if told earlier, they could have adjusted, but since it was a surprise, their attraction faded. That's their right\u2014they can have their own boundaries and attractions. However, the way they handled it might affect whether they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user stopped the sexual encounter and tried to continue the friendship, showing they weren't just abrupt. The other person's anger and accusations (\"evil,\" \"manipulative\") seem extreme and possibly hurtful. The user isn't obligated to continue a relationship if they're not attracted, but they might need to handle it with care to avoid hurting the other person, which they attempted.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the user isn't in the wrong for having their own preferences. The trans man's decision not to disclose earlier might be where the issue lies. The user's actions were a reaction to a situation that made them uncomfortable, and they tried to be respectful by continuing the friendship. The other person's accusations are more concerning as they could be harmful and invalidating.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the user isn't in the wrong). The user acted based on their own feelings and tried to handle it respectfully. The other person's behavior seems more problematic here.\n"
