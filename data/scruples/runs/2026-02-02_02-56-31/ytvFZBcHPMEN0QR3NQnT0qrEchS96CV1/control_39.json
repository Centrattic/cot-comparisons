He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author discovered their crush is trans and suddenly isn't attracted to them anymore. They want to know if they're being an asshole for ending the relationship and not wanting to continue it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their partner were in a relationship that was progressing towards a sexual encounter. The author didn't know the partner was trans until that moment. The partner didn't disclose their trans status earlier, and the author feels lied to. The partner is upset and called the author names, which adds to the conflict.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't attracted to people with vaginas and identifies as straight. They feel their partner didn't disclose important information in a timely manner. The partner might argue that they disclosed their trans status when it became relevant during the intimate moment, but the author feels it should have been mentioned earlier.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, honesty in relationships is crucial. If the partner didn't disclose their trans status before the relationship became sexual, that could be a point of contention. However, trans people often choose when and how to disclose their identity based on their comfort level. There's no universal rule about when to disclose, but transparency is important. The author might have had the right to know before becoming sexually involved, but the partner might have felt the situation wasn't right for that conversation.\n\nThe author's reaction is about their lack of attraction to a vagina. That's a personal preference and not a moral failing. However, the way they ended the relationship might come off as abrupt. The partner's anger and accusations suggest that the disclosure was handled poorly or that there were unresolved tensions.\n\nConsidering societal perspectives, trans people are often misunderstood and face discrimination. The author's strict definition of being straight might not account for the nuances of trans identity, but that's not necessarily the author's fault. The key here is that the author isn't rejecting the person for who they are but for their anatomy, which is a valid personal preference even if it's not ideal from a trans perspective.\n\nThe partner's reaction of calling the author evil and manipulative seems disproportionate and harmful, which might indicate the partner's emotional distress but doesn't justify the author being in the wrong. The author is honest about their feelings and preferences, wanting to remain friends, and isn't attacking the partner's identity beyond the attraction issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to lack of attraction, especially since they were honest about their preferences. The partner's failure to disclose earlier could be a point, but the author's response is a personal choice based on their sexual orientation. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
