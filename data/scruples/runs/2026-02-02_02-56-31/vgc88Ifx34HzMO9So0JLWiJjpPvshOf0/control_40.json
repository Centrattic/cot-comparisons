Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and against vaccinating their future children. The author, a healthcare worker, is firm on vaccinations and gave an ultimatum that if the fianc\u00e9e can't agree to a slightly delayed or alternative schedule (but not no vaccines), he's willing to walk away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that they discussed this before the engagement and had an agreement. The fianc\u00e9e is now more resistant, bringing up the Hep B vaccine at birth as a point of contention. She's also expressed distrust in vaccines as a whole, citing big pharma conspiracies and claiming they don't work, despite evidence presented. The author's compromise is a one-month delay before starting a schedule, but she's now upset, calling him manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe key points here are consent in a relationship and the use of ultimatums. In relationships, both partners should have mutual respect and understanding. However, when it comes to major decisions affecting their children's health, it's crucial that both agree. The author tried to find a middle ground with an alternative schedule, which might be a common approach for some parents who have concerns. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is not compromising and has changed her stance after agreeing previously.\n\nThe author's ultimatum is based on his firm stance on vaccination. While giving an ultimatum is a serious step, it's within his rights if the issue is non-negotiable for him. The problem might be whether the ultimatum is fair or if it's manipulative. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated, but the author believes he's standing by his values and protecting the child's health.\n\nAnother angle is the fianc\u00e9e's openness to change. If she's completely unwilling to budge, regardless of evidence, that's a problem. The author did try to present data, but she's not swayed. In that case, the author is justified in not wanting to compromise further.\n\nHowever, using an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as coercive, even if the topic is important. The question is whether the author gave enough time and alternatives. He allowed for an alternative schedule but only a one-month delay. If the fianc\u00e9e is resistant to even that, maybe the ultimatum is a last resort based on his values.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing his beliefs about his children's health, especially given his professional background. But the method of using an ultimatum could be seen as harsh. However, since the fianc\u00e9e changed her position after the engagement, the author might feel that he's upholding the prior agreement made before the proposal.\n\nThe final decision hinges on whether the author's actions are reasonable. If he's not forcing her to vaccinate but allowing for an alternative schedule (which is a compromise), and she's unwilling to accept even that, then he's not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to engage constructively might place the responsibility on her. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
