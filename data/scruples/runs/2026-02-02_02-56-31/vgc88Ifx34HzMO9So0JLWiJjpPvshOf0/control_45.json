Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to his fianc\u00e9e over vaccines. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and against vaccinating their future children. The author, being a healthcare worker, is pro-vaccine and has set a condition that if she can't accept at least starting the Hep B vaccine at birth, he's willing to end the engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions they had prior discussions and agreed on some alternative schedule. But now, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, even bringing up conspiracy theories about Big Pharma. The author's stance is firm because he's concerned about the health of the child and his own risk as a HC worker. He's given her a clear ultimatum: one month before starting an alternative schedule. She's taking it as manipulative or abusive.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to protect the child's health based on his own professional knowledge. He's given her a compromise (delaying the Hep B vaccine by a month) but she's not willing to budge. He's also tried to present evidence, which she's dismissing. The question is whether setting this boundary is wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings are hurt because she believes vaccines are harmful and that the author is being controlling. Her past statements suggest she's not just hesitant but anti-vax. The author is standing by his values, which are important for a future parent. \n\nLegal aspects might not be the main concern here, but ethically, it's about mutual respect. If both parties can't find common ground on such a critical issue for their children's health, the author's decision to set a firm boundary might be justified. He's not forcing her to accept the vaccines but is stating his non-negotiable line. \n\nSo, considering that the author tried to meet her halfway and she's unwilling to compromise on a significant health issue, it's not necessarily his fault. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
