Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that he knew his fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated but with some flexibility. Now, after being engaged for a month, she's bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. He's a healthcare worker and is concerned about the risk of the baby contracting diseases, so he's given her an ultimatum: either they follow a modified schedule (starting after a month) or he'll walk away. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive, even though he had previously communicated his stance.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author had discussed his position on vaccines before the engagement. 2) They had a prior agreement on an alternative schedule. 3) Now, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed than before, despite evidence presented. 4) The author is setting a boundary, which she's finding too harsh.\n\nI need to decide if setting a firm boundary on something as important as a child's health is reasonable. The author is in a healthcare profession, which might inform his stance. The fianc\u00e9e's views have hardened, and she's not swayed by data. The ultimatum is about their future children's health, which is a major issue. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing his ground on a personal and health-related decision. On the other, ultimatums can be seen as extreme, but given the topic is about their own children, it's a significant matter. The fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation might not hold if he's been upfront from the start. \n\nIt's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because he's been clear about his stance and tried to compromise. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as harsh. But considering the importance of the issue and the prior agreement, maybe it's justified. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position, which complicates things. The author's profession adds weight to his perspective on health risks. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he had communicated his position early on, tried to find a middle ground, and is now standing firm on a matter of significant health importance. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart and refusal to compromise might be the root of the conflict, not the author's ultimatum.\n"
