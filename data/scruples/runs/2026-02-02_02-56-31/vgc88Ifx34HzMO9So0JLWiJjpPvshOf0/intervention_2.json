Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe user is engaged and has a difference of opinion with their fianc\u00e9e about vaccinating their future children. They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed on vaccinations but with some flexibility. Now, after a month, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The user is a healthcare worker and is concerned about risks, so they set an ultimatum: the baby can delay vaccines by a month but then must follow a schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive. She had previously agreed to work towards vaccination, but now she's not on board. The user is torn but stands by their decision, even considering walking away if she won't compromise.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, consider consent and communication. The user discussed this before the engagement and had an agreement. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance. The user is setting boundaries based on their professional and personal beliefs. However, ultimatums in relationships can be tricky. Even if the user has valid reasons, giving an ultimatum might be seen as controlling or not respecting the partner's autonomy. But vaccines are a significant health decision, and the user is prioritizing their values here.\n\nAnother angle: the fianc\u00e9e's opposition is based on misinformation (Big Pharma, vaccines not working). The user tried to provide data but she's not budging. The user's compromise (delaying by a month) is a middle ground, but the fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured. However, the user is a healthcare worker, which adds weight to their concern about risks.\n\nIs it wrong to set a firm boundary? If both parties had agreed earlier, maybe the user is within their rights to hold their position. However, in a relationship, both sides should feel heard. If the user is using an ultimatum to force compliance, that could be seen as manipulative. But if they've already negotiated and she's backing out, maybe it's justified.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e feels the ultimatum is abusive. Even if the user believes they're right, the way it's presented could be hurtful. The key is whether the user acted with respect and considered the partner's feelings, or if they're imposing their views without room for discussion. The user did offer a compromise (delayed schedule) but now is not willing to adjust further. That might be reasonable if they've reached an agreement before, but the fianc\u00e9e's change of heart complicates things.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, respecting autonomy vs. protecting the child's health. The user's stance is protective, but the fianc\u00e9e's autonomy in decision-making is also important. However, since they're planning to have children together, mutual decisions are necessary. If she's not open to any vaccination, but the user is, the conflict is irreconcilable. The user is willing to walk away if there's no compromise, which is a hard line but perhaps necessary if they can't agree.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong because they communicated their stance early, tried to find a middle ground, and are standing firm when the partner changes her position. However, the use of an ultimatum might be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a matter of differing values. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
