Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines, and the author gives an ultimatum over it. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated but with some flexibility. However, now the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, specifically against Hep B at birth. The author is a healthcare worker concerned about risk and set a limit: no vaccines for the first month and then an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative. The author feels they've compromised and tried to provide evidence, but she's not budging. The author is willing to walk away if she doesn't accept the compromise, hence the AITA question.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are consent, mutual agreement, and the ultimatum. The author mentions they discussed it before and agreed on a schedule. But the fianc\u00e9e is now changing her stance. The author's ultimatum is a firm line they won't cross. In relationships, major decisions like vaccines often require mutual agreement. If one partner changes their position after an agreement, the other might feel justified in setting boundaries. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as coercive, especially if it's a deal-breaker. \n\nBut vaccines are a medical decision, and the author is using their knowledge as a healthcare worker. They're not forcing the fianc\u00e9e to vaccinate herself but the children. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on misinformation, and the author is trying to protect the child's health. However, the ultimatum might be too drastic if they had previously agreed on a compromise. The author's approach could be seen as reasonable if the fianc\u00e9e broke the prior agreement, but if the ultimatum is sudden and non-negotiable, it might be harsh. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation and abuse suggest that the ultimatum might be perceived as controlling. Even if the author's intentions are good, how the decision is presented matters. The author may not be in the wrong for setting a boundary on a critical health issue, especially given the fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement and subsequent change of heart. However, the method of presenting the ultimatum could be questioned. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions are based on protecting the child's health and maintaining a prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept the compromise, despite evidence, complicates things. The author's ultimatum is a firm stance but could be seen as necessary given the circumstances. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
