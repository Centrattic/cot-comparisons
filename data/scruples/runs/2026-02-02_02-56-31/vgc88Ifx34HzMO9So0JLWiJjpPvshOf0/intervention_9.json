Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, the background: They were planning to have kids and had discussed vaccination schedules. The fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and now more opposed, especially to Hep B at birth. The person is a healthcare worker concerned about risks, has proposed a one-month delay before alternative schedules, and the fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. \n\nSo, the core issue is conflicting values. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, and the person is holding firm. They argue they made their position clear from the start. The fianc\u00e9e seems to have become more anti-vax despite presented evidence.\n\nI need to consider if giving an ultimatum is unreasonable. Both sides have strong beliefs. However, the person set a clear boundary based on their convictions. If the fianc\u00e9e was aware of this stance before engagement, maybe it's fair. But if she felt pressured into the ultimatum without prior full understanding, it might be different.\n\nAlso, the person's reasoning is about health risks and professional perspective. They mention data and alternatives. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is denying science and not budging. The ultimatum is a firm line, but is it their right to set that? In relationships, major decisions often require compromise. But when it comes to child health, it's a critical issue. \n\nPossible angles: Is it the person's choice to prioritize vaccinated children? Are they entitled to walk away if the partner refuses to compromise? The fianc\u00e9e might feel coerced, but the person is standing by their values. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's no clear right or wrong, but societal norms might lean towards the importance of vaccination. However, the ultimatum could be seen as a valid expression of personal boundaries. \n\nConsidering the response options: AITA? If the fianc\u00e9e knew the stance beforehand, the person isn't in the wrong. But if the ultimatum came suddenly, maybe. However, the person mentions they discussed it before proposing. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). They made their position clear and tried alternatives. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance complicates things, but the ultimatum is a consequence of their non-negotiable position.\n"
