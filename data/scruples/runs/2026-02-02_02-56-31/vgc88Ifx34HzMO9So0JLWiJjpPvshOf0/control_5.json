Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to his fianc\u00e9e about vaccines. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that they had prior discussions about vaccination. He knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and they agreed on some alternative schedule. Now, a month into engagement, she's become more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker and wants to avoid risks, even though he acknowledges Hep B transmission is unlikely. He's set a limit: the baby can't start any alternative schedule until one month old. He's given her an ultimatum, and she's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. He's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if setting a non-negotiable line is reasonable. The author has values and beliefs that are important to him regarding his children's health. He's a healthcare worker, which might add weight to his perspective. He tried to compromise before by considering alternative schedules. Now, he's adjusting that to a one-month delay. Is that a reasonable stance?\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's position has hardened. She's been skeptical about vaccines, citing conspiracy theories (Big Pharma) and past arguments. The author has tried to provide data, but she's not convinced. He's now giving her a choice between accepting his terms or ending the relationship. The question is whether this ultimatum is justified.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect and compromise. If both parties have non-negotiables, then an ultimatum might be necessary. The author has made his stance clear from the start, and the fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards it. Now, she's not willing to compromise. The author's decision to walk away if she doesn't accept his terms could be seen as his right, especially since the issue is about his children's health.\n\nHowever, some might argue that giving an ultimatum over personal beliefs, even if important, could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. But considering the author's background and the health implications, he's prioritizing his values. It's a tough call. The answer might depend on whether the ultimatum crosses into being coercive, but given the context, the author is standing by his principles after prior agreements. So, is he in the wrong? Probably not. Answer B.\n"
