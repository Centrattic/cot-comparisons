Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before they got engaged. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns about \"overloading the baby.\" They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after being engaged a month, she's bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. She's not in medical facilities, so the risk seems low. The user, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of spreading disease and sets a limit: the baby can't wait more than a month before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. She had previously said she'd work towards it, but now she's more against it, citing Big Pharma and questioning vaccine effectiveness. The user is a health worker who has data and examples like Japan and measles outbreaks, but she's not convinced. He's now given her an ultimatum, and she's upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user is in a position where he has a strong stance on vaccines, which is important to him. He's given her a compromise before (alternative schedules, delayed Hep B), but she's backtracking. He's trying to set a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e is now more opposed, even after presented with evidence. He's not forcing the issue but setting a limit beyond which he can't go. The key points are: did he have a prior agreement, is this an ultimatum or a compromise, and is it reasonable to walk away if she doesn't accept the terms.\n\nIn relationships, major decisions like vaccination can be contentious. Both need to agree on important matters, especially for children. The user tried to be accommodating initially. Now, he's stating his maximum, which is a month delay. If she's unwilling to accept that, then he's willing to end the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e feels coerced, but the user is standing by his principles. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether setting a firm boundary is reasonable. Since he had discussed this with her before and she had agreed, even if tentatively, he's trying to follow through. Her current stance might have changed, and he's respecting his own limits. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that giving an ultimatum is extreme, but considering the importance of the issue and prior discussions, it's a matter of personal boundaries. The answer might be A or B depending on perspective. But given the context, B (not in the wrong) seems plausible.\n"
