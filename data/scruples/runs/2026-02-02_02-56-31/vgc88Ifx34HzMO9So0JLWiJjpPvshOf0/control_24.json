Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe person is engaged to someone who is unvaccinated. They discussed having their children vaccinated following some alternative schedule, maybe from another country. The fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth, which she can't see the need for because the baby wouldn't contract it. The author is a healthcare worker and wants the kids to be vaccinated, but is okay with an alternative schedule. Now he's given an ultimatum: either the baby gets vaccinated within a month or the engagement is over. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. He's not budging, even after showing her data from WHO and CDC, and she still thinks it's a big pharma scam. So the question is, is he in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made a decision based on his professional background and values. He's a healthcare worker, so he's likely aware of the risks of not vaccinating. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has her own beliefs, which are rooted in anti-vaccine sentiments. He knew she was unvaccinated before proposing but thought they had a compromise. Now she's changed her stance, and he's giving an ultimatum.\n\nIs it wrong to set a boundary in a relationship? If two people can't agree on a fundamental issue, especially regarding the health of their future children, then maybe setting a boundary is reasonable. The author is not forcing her to vaccinate herself, but he's making it clear that he can't accept unvaccinated children. That's a big deal because it's about protecting the child's health.\n\nBut is giving an ultimatum manipulative? If he presented it as a take-it-or-leave-it option without trying to find a middle ground, maybe. However, he mentions they had discussed alternative schedules before, and he's allowing a deferred schedule as the maximum. So he's already given some flexibility. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition has escalated, and he's adjusting his stance based on her not budging. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is prioritizing the child's health and safety, which is a parent's responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are based on misinformation, as the author points out. The ultimatum is a way to enforce his values when he can't compromise further. \n\nHowever, relationships require mutual respect. If the author didn't consider her feelings or the possibility of working through the issue, that could be a problem. But given her repeated refusals and the lack of willingness to accept evidence, maybe it's a justified ultimatum. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are about protecting the child's well-being, which is a significant factor. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to engage with facts complicates things, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting a firm boundary on something as important as vaccination.\n"
