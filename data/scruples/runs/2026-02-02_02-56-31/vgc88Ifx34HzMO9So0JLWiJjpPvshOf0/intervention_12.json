Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to accommodate her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth. She doesn't see the risk of a baby contracting Hep B (since she's never been in medical facilities, etc.), but the user is a healthcare worker and wants to avoid any risk from exposure. He's willing to let the baby go one month before starting an alternative schedule. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. She had previously agreed to work towards vaccination but now isn't. He's tried showing her data from WHO and CDC, but she's still adamant, thinking it's all a big pharma scam and vaccines don't work. He's given her an ultimatum: take this modified schedule or he'll walk away. Now she's upset, and he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has changed. Initially, she agreed to work towards vaccination but now is more anti-vax. The user is a healthcare worker, which might make him more aware of risks. He's compromising by allowing a delayed start but not full refusal. He's trying to find a middle ground. However, she's not budging, and he feels he can't compromise further. Is it his right to set a boundary for his children's health? On the other hand, giving an ultimatum could be seen as controlling. But he's standing by his principles. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might be a problem. The user is trying to protect the child's health. However, making a life decision (like ending a relationship) over this is a big step. But if both can't meet in the middle, maybe it's justified. The key is whether the ultimatum is reasonable. Since he's offering a modified schedule (delayed start) but she refuses all vaccines, and he's not willing to go beyond that, he's not forcing her to vaccinate immediately. So he's trying to accommodate her concerns but has limits. She's not open to reason, which complicates things. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong), as he's setting a boundary based on health concerns and compromise.\n"
