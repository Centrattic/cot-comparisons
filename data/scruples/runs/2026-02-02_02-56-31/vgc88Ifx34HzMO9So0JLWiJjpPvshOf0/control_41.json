Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a vaccine-related ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a healthcare worker who's clear about their stance on vaccines. They had discussions before engagement about alternative schedules, maybe even a different country's schedule. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, even to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author sets a limit: wait a month before starting any alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and abusive because of the ultimatum.\n\nThe key points here are consent in relationships, the use of ultimatums, and differing values. The author claims they made their stance clear from the start. However, giving a firm ultimatum, especially on such a significant issue, can be seen as controlling. Even if the author has valid reasons, the method of presenting it as a take-it-or-leave-it could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are rooted in her own research and distrust of big pharma. The author is trying to compromise by allowing an alternative schedule, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging. The author's healthcare background might reinforce their confidence in vaccines, but that doesn't mean the fianc\u00e9e's concerns are invalid from her perspective. \n\nIn relationships, major decisions like this should be mutual. An ultimatum could be seen as a power move rather than a collaborative decision. Even if the author is firm in their beliefs, the way they present the ultimatum might cross into manipulative territory. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests that this was a deal-breaker for her, which is a critical point. \n\nSo, while the author has a valid concern for their child's health, the approach might be where they're in the wrong. The question is whether the ultimatum is justified. Since the answer depends on balance between personal values and respecting a partner's autonomy, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing further negotiation or for using an ultimatum as a means to enforce their stance.\n"
