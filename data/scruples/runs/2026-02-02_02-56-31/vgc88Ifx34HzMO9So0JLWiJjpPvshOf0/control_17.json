Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the background: The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before they got engaged. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. He agreed to an alternative schedule but now she's more against vaccines, specifically the Hep B at birth. He wants to delay vaccines by a month, but she's upset and calling him manipulative. He's a healthcare worker, so he's concerned about the risk of bringing diseases home. She's denying the effectiveness of vaccines and citing conspiracy theories. He's standing his ground and considering walking away if she doesn't accept his compromise.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's think about the key points. He knew her stance before proposing and negotiated. He's made a compromise (delaying by a month). She's changed her position, which he finds frustrating. He's presented evidence from reliable sources, but she's still not budging. He's clear about his non-negotiable stance for the baby's health. \n\nIs giving an ultimatum wrong? Well, he's trying to protect the child's health, which is a parent's responsibility. It's a major decision affecting the child's future. If both parents can't agree, it's a serious conflict. Some might say he's right to set boundaries, especially since health is involved. Others might argue that the ultimatum is too harsh, but given the stakes, he's not wrong in prioritizing the child's safety. Also, she knew his stance from the start. She might need to reconsider her position, but he's within his rights to expect her to meet his terms for the child's well-being.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B\u2014No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
