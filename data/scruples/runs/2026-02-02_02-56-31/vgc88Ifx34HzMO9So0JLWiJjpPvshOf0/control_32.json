Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e wanting to use an alternative vaccine schedule for their future child, while the author is firm about vaccines and gave an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions they discussed alternatives before proposing, agreeing on some schedule. Now the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to Hep B at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, wants to minimize risks and set a one-month delay as the max. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative. The author feels they're justified because they made their stance clear from the start.\n\nI should consider if the author's ultimatum is reasonable. They gave some flexibility (alternative schedule with a one-month delay), which shows willingness to compromise. However, ultimatums in relationships can be tricky. Even if the author's stance is based on health concerns, forcing a decision might be seen as controlling. But the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards vaccination, so maybe the author isn't wrong for standing by their decision when she's backtracking without a good reason.\n\nAlso, the author provided data and evidence, which is responsible. The fianc\u00e9e's anti-vax stance is a problem, as vaccines are proven effective and safe. The author's concern about disease risks versus vaccine complications is valid. However, using an ultimatum to end the relationship if the fianc\u00e9e doesn't comply could be seen as extreme, even if the author's reasons are sound. It's possible the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their non-negotiables and tried to meet halfway, but the ultimatum itself might be harsh. But given the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence, maybe the author is justified.\n\nHmm. The key points are communication, compromise, and the nature of the ultimatum. The author tried to find a middle ground, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't cooperating. If the author made their stance clear early on and the fianc\u00e9e agreed, then it's not entirely the author's fault the relationship is in trouble. However, the ultimatum could be seen as putting pressure, so maybe there's some fault there. But given the health implications, the author might be in the right. I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
