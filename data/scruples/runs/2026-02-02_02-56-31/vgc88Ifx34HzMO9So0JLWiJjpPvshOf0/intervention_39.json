Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and against vaccinating their future children. The person gave an ultimatum about vaccines, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, they knew about her stance before proposing and discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated but with some flexibility. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The person, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and set a limit of a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. The person set a firm boundary based on their beliefs, and the fianc\u00e9e's position has hardened. They tried to compromise but she's not accepting it. The question is whether giving an ultimatum is wrong. \n\nIn relationships, major decisions like vaccination require mutual agreement. If both parties can't meet in the middle, it's a valid reason for conflict. However, ultimatums can be seen as extreme. But considering the fianc\u00e9e had prior knowledge of his stance, and they discussed it, maybe the ultimatum isn't entirely out of line. However, using an ultimatum might be seen as the person being rigid, especially if the fianc\u00e9e's views were more tentative initially. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's stance has become more fixed and distrustful of medical data, which is a significant issue. The person is standing by his principles, which is understandable. It's a tough call because both need to respect each other's values. If they can't, ending the relationship might be the only option. But giving an ultimatum could be seen as putting pressure, hence possibly wrong. Or it's a matter of principle. \n\nI think the answer might be B, the person isn't in the wrong because they made their stance clear, tried to compromise, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her position. However, the ultimatum might have been the final straw. But maybe the person should have considered other solutions instead of an ultimatum. Hmm. It's tricky. The key is whether the ultimatum was reasonable given the prior discussions. Since they had agreed on vaccination but with alternative schedules, the person's limit of a one-month delay might be within the compromise. So, I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
