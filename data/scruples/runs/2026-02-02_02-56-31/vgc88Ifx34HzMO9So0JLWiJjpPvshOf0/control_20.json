Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the baby's health and wants to follow a schedule but allows a one-month delay. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive. The author is confused because they thought they had an agreement before the engagement.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author is standing by their commitment to vaccinate, which they communicated early in the relationship. They compromised by allowing an alternative schedule with a one-month delay. The fianc\u00e9e is now more resistant, not accepting the data provided. The author feels they're taking a firm stance on health, which is important for them. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have different beliefs. The author isn't forcing vaccines but setting a boundary they're comfortable with. They gave a compromise. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, but the author isn't forcing immediate vaccination. Whether it's right or wrong could depend on personal values. \n\nBut in terms of the ultimatum being manipulative or abusive, it's a bit subjective. The author is expressing their non-negotiables, which is part of any relationship. However, if the ultimatum is causing emotional distress, maybe there's a gray area. However, the author isn't forcing her to do anything, just stating their conditions for marriage. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the agreement. The author might feel justified in upholding their position since they had previous discussions. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction seems to be a shift in her own beliefs, which the author can't control. The author's stance is about protecting their child's health, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They presented a compromise and set boundaries. The fianc\u00e9e is the one changing her position. Therefore, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
