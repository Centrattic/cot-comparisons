Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines, and the author is giving an ultimatum. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country. The fianc\u00e9e is against Hep B vaccine at birth, thinking the baby wouldn't get it. The author, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants to follow a modified schedule. He gives her an ultimatum: either agree to start the schedule within a month or it's over. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. The author is confused because they had agreed before, but now she's not budging despite data and evidence.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: they had prior discussions, agreed on vaccinated kids but with alternative schedules, but she's now against it. He's giving her an ultimatum. The question is whether he's overstepping or in the right.\n\nI need to consider if an ultimatum is reasonable. If both parties discussed this before and she agreed to work towards it, but now refuses despite evidence, maybe he's within his rights to set boundaries. However, ultimatums can be seen as controlling, especially in a relationship. But he's standing by his initial stance, which he considered important enough to propose with. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's views have hardened, maybe due to misinformation, and he's trying to protect the child's health.\n\nOn one hand, he's trying to safeguard the child's health, which is a parent's responsibility. On the other hand, giving an ultimatum might be seen as not respecting her autonomy. But since they were planning to have children, this is a significant issue. The author is a healthcare worker, which might influence his stance. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to engage with data and her conspiracy theories (big pharma) could be problematic. He might be protecting the child from avoidable diseases, which are more dangerous than vaccines. \n\nBut is it right to end the relationship over this? Some might argue that it's his right to have vaccinated kids, so if she's unwilling, he's justified. Others might say that giving an ultimatum is too harsh and that compromise should be sought. However, he's made it clear from the start, and she's changed her stance after engagement. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing by his decision for the child's welfare. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite prior agreement and evidence might mean he's justified in setting the boundary. Therefore, Answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
