Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThey knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine. The fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines, thinks they're a hoax, and there's been a breakdown in agreement. The user, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and set an ultimatum: either they follow a modified schedule, but not delay beyond a month. Now she's upset and calling it manipulation and abuse.\n\nSo the key points are: prior agreement, current conflict over vaccination, ultimatum given, and her reaction. The user is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the user had a prior agreement. They tried to accommodate her concerns by suggesting an alternative schedule. Now, when the fianc\u00e9e is backtracking and refusing to follow through, the user is standing their ground. The user is trying to protect the child's health based on medical evidence. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is being resistant, even in the face of data and arguments. \n\nBut relationships require compromise. However, if one partner is non-negotiable on a core value issue (like vaccinations), it's reasonable to set a boundary. The user isn't forcing her to vaccinate themselves, just the child. The ultimatum here is about the child's health, which is a significant factor. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reaction seems to be a big deal. She's calling it manipulative, but the user is stating their non-negotiable line. If she can't accept that, then maybe the relationship isn't compatible. \n\nI think the user is not in the wrong here. They tried to find a middle ground, but when the other partner is unwilling to compromise on such an important issue, setting a boundary is justified.\n"
