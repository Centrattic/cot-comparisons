Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e about vaccinating their future children. They wanted to know if they should be the one to answer A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and strongly against vaccines, even bringing up the Hep B vaccine at birth. The user, a healthcare worker, is pro-vaccine and has set a limit where the baby can't start any vaccine schedule until one month of age. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. \n\nThe user mentions they discussed this before getting engaged and came to an agreement, but now she's backtracking. They tried providing data from WHO and CDC, but she still doesn't believe. The user feels they're justified in holding their ground because vaccines are important and they can't compromise on their children's health.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the user is at fault. From a moral perspective, it's a tough one. On one hand, the user has a valid concern about their child's health and the medical consensus supports vaccines. On the other, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as harsh. However, the user mentions that they had prior discussions and the fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards a compromise. Now she's not willing to follow through.\n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e claims the user is being manipulative. Ultimatums can be seen as extreme, but if the user has tried multiple times to reason and the fianc\u00e9e remains unmoved, then the user might feel it's necessary to set a boundary. The user isn't forcing vaccines; they're allowing for an alternative schedule but only after a delay, which might be a middle ground. \n\nConsidering that the user is in healthcare, their stance is likely informed by professional experience. The fianc\u00e9e's views, based on the description, seem to be based on misinformation (like Big Pharma conspiracy theories). The user tried to address her concerns with evidence but she's not budging. \n\nIn relationships, major decisions like vaccination are significant. If both parties can't agree, it's reasonable for the user to prioritize their values. However, the method of handling it\u2014giving an ultimatum\u2014might be seen as extreme. But given the circumstances, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. They tried to compromise, presented facts, and the fianc\u00e9e didn't meet her end of the bargain. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the user is standing by their values and tried to find a middle ground, but the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise despite evidence is problematic. The user isn't wrong for holding their line on something as critical as their children's health.\n"
