Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by going through the details carefully.\n\nThe user is a fianc\u00e9 whose partner is unvaccinated and initially agreed to an alternative schedule. They had a discussion before getting engaged about vaccinations for their future children. Now, after being engaged for a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines than before, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The user, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risks of not vaccinating and is willing to delay the first dose by a month but wants to follow some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive. She previously agreed to work towards vaccination, but now she's more adamant in her opposition, even claiming vaccines are a hoax. The user is considering ending the relationship if she doesn't agree to the terms.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue here. The main conflict is about vaccination, which is a deeply personal and important health decision. The user has clear boundaries based on his profession and beliefs. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has hardened, and she's refusing to compromise. The user gave her an ultimatum because he can't accept no, which is a significant decision in a relationship.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The user made his stance clear from the beginning, and the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed. However, her changing her mind after engagement might be a problem. But relationships involve compromise, and it's possible that she's just becoming more vocal about her beliefs now. On the other hand, the user is standing his ground because he can't accept a situation that goes against his professional ethics and health concerns for their future children.\n\nUltimatums are a big deal. They can be seen as manipulative if they're used to control or pressure someone. However, in this case, the user is stating his non-negotiable line. If the fianc\u00e9e was aware of his position and agreed initially, but then changed her mind, the user is trying to maintain the agreement they made. However, people can change their minds, especially on issues as complex and emotional as vaccines.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests she feels the ultimatum is a breach of trust, even if she agreed before. Maybe she thought there was more flexibility. The user presented a compromise (one month delay), but if she feels that's still not acceptable, the conflict is real. The user is in a position where he can't agree to no vaccines, so he's setting a boundary. But is it wrong to walk away? Well, if both sides can't meet in the middle, ending the relationship might be necessary for the user to protect his values.\n\nI should also consider the health implications. Vaccines are a public health issue, and the user's concern about exposing the baby to risks is valid. The fianc\u00e9e's denial of vaccine efficacy is based on misinformation, which the user has tried to correct with data. If she's not open to evidence, then the user is left with no other choice but to set a firm boundary.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's values. If the user's core value is vaccinating children and the fianc\u00e9e's is opposing vaccines, they might be fundamentally incompatible. The ultimatum is a way to enforce that boundary. However, ultimatums can be seen as harsh, but in this context, it's about a non-negotiable for the user.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If he clearly communicated his stance and she agreed, then changing her mind later might make the user justified in standing his ground. However, if the fianc\u00e9e's current stance is a genuine shift and she's trying to find middle ground, maybe the user is being too rigid. But given her previous statements about vaccines being a hoax and not working, it's unlikely she's open to any compromise beyond a month delay.\n\nThe final answer would hinge on whether setting a firm boundary is fair when the other person's stance is based on misinformation and the user's profession and ethics are at stake.\n"
