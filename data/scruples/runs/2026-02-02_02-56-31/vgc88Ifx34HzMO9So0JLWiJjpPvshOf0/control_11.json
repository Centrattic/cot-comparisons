Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to his fianc\u00e9e about vaccines. The key points are that he knew she was unvaccinated before proposing, they had discussed alternative schedules, but now she's against vaccines entirely. He's given her an ultimatum, and she's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author is a healthcare worker, which probably informs his strong stance on vaccines. He's given her the option of a delayed schedule but is firm about vaccines in general. He mentions prior agreement, but she's changed her stance. He's using data and references to institutions like WHO and CDC, while she's skeptical of big pharma. He's not budging because of health risks, even if small, which is understandable.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, ultimatums are tough in relationships. They can be seen as extreme, but if there's a core value issue, some might say it's justified. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate but is setting a boundary for the children. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in stance might have caused the conflict. However, the ultimatum could be seen as controlling if she never agreed to this condition. Also, the term \"abusive\" is serious and might indicate that the ultimatum crossed a line, even if his intentions are good. But he's standing by his non-negotiable belief, which is about the health of future children. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, respecting autonomy is important. The author is respecting her schedule up to a point but drawing a line. But if she's not willing to compromise at all, the ultimatum might be necessary for him. However, the way he's framed it could be problematic. Did he give her enough time to process or reconsider? The answer might depend on cultural context and relationship dynamics. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a tricky situation. He's firm on his values, which is his right, but the ultimatum's timing and framing might be where he's in the wrong. However, if health is a non-negotiable for him, some might side with him. But given that the fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated, there's a case for AITA being the author. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's upholding his values and health considerations, but others might see it as A due to the ultimatum's nature. The question is whether the ultimatum is justified given prior discussions. Since they had agreed on vaccines, her change of heart complicates it. I'm leaning towards B.\n"
