Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. They knew she was against vaccines before proposing, but they had agreed on following some schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine. He's a healthcare worker and is really concerned about the risks of not vaccinating. He set a boundary of a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule, but she's now accusing him of being manipulative and abusive. He wants to know if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards vaccines but is now against them. The user is standing his ground because of his profession and health concerns. He's given a compromise (alternative schedule but only after a month). She's not budging, and he's willing to walk away. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's about personal beliefs vs. health science. The user is prioritizing evidence-based medicine, which many would support. However, ultimatums in relationships can be problematic if they're controlling. But here, he's setting a boundary based on his values. The fianc\u00e9e's stance seems to be against scientific consensus, which could be a red flag. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. They had a prior agreement, but she changed her mind. He's given a reasonable compromise. If she can't accept any vaccination, even with a slight delay, then the conflict is real. The user isn't forcing her to do anything; he's stating his non-negotiable. Whether that's manipulative depends on context. Since he's a healthcare worker and she's not, her anti-vax stance might be irresponsible. \n\nLegally, in some places, parents can choose alternative schedules, but refusing all vaccines isn't legal. However, the user is offering an alternative, which is within legal bounds. Emotionally, the fianc\u00e9e might feel cornered, but the user is protecting his values. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because he's setting a boundary based on his health knowledge and values. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise despite evidence might be the issue here. So, answer B.\n"
