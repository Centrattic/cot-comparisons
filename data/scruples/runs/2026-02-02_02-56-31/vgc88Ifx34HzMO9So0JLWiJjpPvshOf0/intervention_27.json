Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and against vaccinating their future children. The person (the fianc\u00e9) gave an ultimatum that they can't go past a one-month delay before starting the vaccine schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset and calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9 made it clear from the start that they wanted their kids vaccinated. They compromised by considering an alternative schedule, maybe from another country. But now the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed than before. She brings up the Hep B vaccine, which is typically given at birth, but her argument is that the baby wouldn't contract it unless she's positive. She's also bringing in conspiracy theories about Big Pharma. The fianc\u00e9, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks, even though they acknowledge the risk is low. They set a hard limit of one month, and now the fianc\u00e9e is upset and the relationship is in jeopardy.\n\nSo, the question is whether the fianc\u00e9 is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum. Let's break it down. They did discuss this before getting engaged, so there was prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9 tried to accommodate by suggesting alternative schedules. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance. The fianc\u00e9 is standing by their decision because they have strong convictions about vaccination. \n\nOn one hand, ultimatums can be seen as extreme, especially in a relationship. But on the other hand, if it's a non-negotiable issue for the fianc\u00e9, maybe it's justified. The key here is whether the ultimatum was given with bad intent or manipulation. The fianc\u00e9 claims they tried to find a middle ground, so it's not just a random ultimatum. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's stance has become more extreme, including conspiracy beliefs, which are hard to compromise on. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is a healthcare worker, which might add weight to their concern about public health and safety. They\u2019re not just being stubborn; they\u2019re prioritizing the child's health based on their professional knowledge. However, the way the ultimatum was presented might come off as controlling. But considering the prior discussion and the fianc\u00e9e's change in position, the fianc\u00e9 might feel it's necessary.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if both parties entered the relationship with different values, and the fianc\u00e9 made their stance clear from the beginning, then the fianc\u00e9e might be responsible for not following through. But the fianc\u00e9 could also be at fault for not considering that the fianc\u00e9e's views might evolve or become more entrenched, leading to the ultimatum. \n\nHowever, since the fianc\u00e9e is now refusing to budge despite evidence and discussions, and the fianc\u00e9 has set a firm boundary, it's a matter of conflicting values. Neither side is entirely wrong, but the fianc\u00e9 is standing up for their beliefs, which they communicated upfront. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might indicate that she wasn't serious about compromising. So, maybe the fianc\u00e9 isn't in the wrong here. They tried to find a middle ground, but when that failed, they set a boundary. It's a tough spot, but given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
