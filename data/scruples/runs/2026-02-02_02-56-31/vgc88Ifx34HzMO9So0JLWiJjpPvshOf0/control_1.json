Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his fianc\u00e9e had previously discussed a compromise on vaccination schedules, but now she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. He's a healthcare worker concerned about risks, and he set a deadline where the baby must start vaccinations within a month. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive.\n\nSo, the key points are: prior agreement, her changing stance, his professional background, the ultimatum, and her reaction. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author is standing by his stance, which is about protecting the child's health based on his expertise. However, ultimatums in relationships can be seen as controlling. But vaccines are a medical decision, and parents often have to make joint decisions. The fianc\u00e9e's beliefs (anti-vax) are based on misinformation, which he's tried to counter with data but she's not budging.\n\nLegally, both parents have rights, but if they can't agree, one parent might have to take the lead. However, in the US, both parents usually have equal say unless one is deemed unfit. But the author is not trying to force her; he's compromising by allowing an alternative schedule with a one-month delay. \n\nEmotionally, ultimatums can strain relationships. But when it comes to child's health, especially when one parent is adamant about safety, it's complicated. The author tried to find a middle ground but she's not cooperating. He's not forcing her, just stating his limits.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the ultimatum is about protecting the child and he's given some flexibility, maybe not. But if it's too rigid, maybe. However, since he's a healthcare worker and she's refusing all vaccines, his stance could be justified. The problem is her not engaging in good faith after agreeing before. \n\nI think he's justified in setting boundaries, especially for the child's well-being. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
