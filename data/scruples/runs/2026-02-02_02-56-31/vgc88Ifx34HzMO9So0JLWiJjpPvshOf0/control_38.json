Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The scenario is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets an ultimatum: the baby can't start vaccines until a month old, otherwise, they part ways. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and abusive. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author is justified in setting such a strict boundary. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is standing firm on their belief that vaccines are important, supported by data from WHO and CDC. They've tried to compromise with an alternative schedule. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, and the author is now using an ultimatum, which the fianc\u00e9e perceives as controlling.\n\nI should think about consent and mutual agreement. They had a prior agreement, but the fianc\u00e9e is now backing out. The author feels that vaccines are non-negotiable, and since the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging despite evidence, the ultimatum is their way of protecting their values. However, ultimatums in relationships can be seen as extreme, even if based on strong convictions. The author is a healthcare worker, which adds credibility to their stance, but it's still a personal choice for the family. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to compromise? Maybe they should have discussed this more before engagement. But they did mention prior discussions. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, especially if the author uses their profession to sway the argument. Also, the author's ultimatum is a significant decision that affects both partners and future children. The fianc\u00e9e's feelings of being manipulated are valid if the author is using their position to dominate the decision-making.\n\nIn terms of ethics and relationships, major life decisions should be mutual. However, when there's a fundamental disagreement that one is unwilling to compromise on, it's a tough spot. The author's stance is about their children's health, which is a valid concern. But the method of handling it\u2014giving an ultimatum\u2014might be seen as harsh, especially if it's causing emotional distress.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions cross into being controlling or abusive. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests she feels that way. Even if the author's intentions are good, the delivery might be the problem. There's also the aspect of autonomy; the fianc\u00e9e might feel her beliefs are being dismissed. However, the author isn't forcing her to do anything; they're stating their own boundaries.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns and tried to find a middle ground, the ultimatum approach might be too rigid, leading to the fianc\u00e9e feeling pressured. But on the flip side, the author isn't the one backing down from their prior agreement. It's a complex situation where both might have valid points, but the question is about the author's fault. The answer depends on whether setting such a strict boundary is considered wrong in the context of the relationship's prior agreements and mutual respect.\n"
