Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, they knew her stance before proposing and had discussed a compromise. Then, after a month of engagement, she brings up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine. The user is a healthcare worker concerned about risks. They offered a maximum of a one-month delay before starting the vaccine schedule. The fianc\u00e9e now calls it manipulative and abusive, even though they had agreed before. She's not changing her mind despite evidence from CDC and WHO, and now he's considering walking away.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about compromise, communication, and the ultimatum. He set a clear boundary based on his values and profession. She's changed her position, or maybe just become more adamant? Did they have a clear agreement initially? He mentioned she agreed to work towards vaccination, but now she's against it. Maybe she wasn't as committed as he thought. The Hep B vaccine at birth is standard, but she's not in a high-risk group. He's giving a one-month grace period, which might be reasonable. \n\nIs giving an ultimatum wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners have to negotiate. If he's non-negotiable on this, and she can't budge, then he's not wrong to set his boundaries. But is the ultimatum itself abusive? He says he doesn't want things to end. So maybe he's trying to find a middle ground. However, she feels manipulated. But he's standing by his decision. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the vaccines are necessary, and the alternative schedule is a compromise. She's not accepting that. Since he's a healthcare worker, his concerns about safety are valid. The fianc\u00e9e's stance seems to be based on misinformation. He's tried to provide evidence, but she's not budging. \n\nIn relationships, when both can't compromise, it's hard. But if one person is willing to walk away over a non-negotiable issue, is that wrong? If he made his expectations clear from the start, then maybe he's not in the wrong. The problem is that she's backtracking. So answer B, he's not in the wrong. The ultimatum is his boundary, and he's standing up for his beliefs, which is reasonable. She might be wrong for not honoring the initial agreement, but he's not in the wrong for setting a limit.\n"
