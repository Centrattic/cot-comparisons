Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and against vaccines, and the author is a healthcare worker who wants their kids to be vaccinated. They had agreed on some alternative schedule, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author gives an ultimatum: either follow a modified schedule starting after a month or not have kids. The fianc\u00e9e is upset and calls it manipulative or abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's position is based on their professional background and the scientific consensus supporting vaccines. They've tried discussing data and evidence, but the fianc\u00e9e remains unconvinced, even with evidence from WHO and CDC. The author feels they've compromised by allowing a delayed schedule but now sees no other option but to walk away if the fianc\u00e9e doesn't agree.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's stance is that vaccines are a hoax and don't work, which is against the mainstream medical opinion. She's also upset about the ultimatum, feeling pressured. The question is whether the author is wrong to give an ultimatum over such a significant decision.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to make their own healthcare choices, but when it comes to children, the parents have a responsibility to act in the child's best interest. Vaccines are widely recognized as safe and effective, so the author's concern is valid. However, using an ultimatum might be seen as extreme, especially if they initially agreed on an alternative schedule but now are not allowing any deviation beyond a month.\n\nBut considering the fianc\u00e9e's stance has shifted and she's not budging despite evidence, the author is trying to protect their future children. They might feel that any delay increases risk, and they can't take that risk given their profession. The ultimatum is a way to enforce their boundaries, which could be seen as justified because the health of the child is at stake.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the ultimatum is too harsh, especially if the fianc\u00e9e was previously on board with a modified schedule. The author might be seen as not respecting her autonomy or being inflexible. But others might say that when it comes to critical health decisions for children, parents need to make tough choices and that the author is standing up for what they believe is best for the child.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's actions might be considered not in the wrong because they're prioritizing the child's health and setting boundaries based on their professional values. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise despite evidence could lead to conflict, and the author is trying to protect the child's well-being. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
