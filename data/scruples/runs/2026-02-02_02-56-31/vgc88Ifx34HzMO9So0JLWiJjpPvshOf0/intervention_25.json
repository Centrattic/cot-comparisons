Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. He wants to give the baby a month before starting an alternative schedule, but she's calling him manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now refuses, despite evidence. The user is a healthcare worker concerned about risk, even if small. He's given some flexibility by allowing a delayed schedule but has a limit. She's not budging, using conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and questioning vaccine efficacy, even when shown data.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong for setting a boundary. In relationships, especially when it comes to children's health, differing values can lead to conflict. The key here is whether an ultimatum is justified. If he's clear about his non-negotiable stance and she's unwilling to compromise, it's a matter of incompatible values. However, ultimatums can be seen as extreme. But considering the health of future children and his professional background, his stance might be reasonable.\n\nI need to check if there's a middle ground. He did offer an alternative schedule, but she's against all vaccines. His compromise was a delay, which she still rejects. If she's not open to any vaccination, then his ultimatum is based on his non-negotiable line. He's not forcing her to accept his views but is stating his limit. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to engage with evidence and her accusations of manipulation might indicate her own issues with control or fear.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, which often includes vaccination. If they can't agree, it's a valid reason for the relationship to end. However, the ultimatum approach might come off as harsh. But given the circumstances, he's trying to find a balance between his beliefs and her, which she's not willing to meet halfway.\n\nIn conclusion, he's not in the wrong for setting a boundary that's important to him, especially regarding his child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to consider any vaccination, despite evidence and compromise, makes the ultimatum a logical step after attempts to find common ground failed.\n"
