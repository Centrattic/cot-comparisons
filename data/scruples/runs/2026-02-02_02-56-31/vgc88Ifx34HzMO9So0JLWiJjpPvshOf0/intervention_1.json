Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. First, I need to understand the context they provided.\n\nThey mentioned they knew she was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. After a month of engagement, she brings up being against vaccines again, especially the Hep B at birth. The user is a healthcare worker concerned about risks. He set a limit: one month delay before starting a modified schedule. She's now upset, calling him manipulative. She used to agree to work towards vaccination but now doesn't. He's tried showing data from WHO and CDC, but she's still against it, citing Big Pharma and vaccine ineffectiveness. Now she's upset he's willing to walk away.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether giving an ultimatum on vaccines is the wrong approach. Let's consider both sides. The user has a strong stance on vaccines, which he's communicated upfront. He's offered a compromise (alternative schedule with a one-month delay). She's changed her mind after agreeing initially. He's a healthcare worker, so his concern about safety is valid. She's being anti-vax now, despite evidence. He's trying to protect the child's health.\n\nOn the other hand, ultimatums can be seen as controlling, especially in a relationship. But vaccines are a significant health issue. The user has tried to find a middle ground. She might feel pressured, but he's setting boundaries based on his values. The key here is whether the ultimatum is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nIn relationships, differing core values can lead to breaking points. Vaccines are a medical decision with public health implications. The user is respecting her initial agreement but now she's not following through. He's not forcing her to vaccinate immediately but is setting a firm limit. If she can't meet that, the relationship could end. That's a tough call, but it's about differing priorities.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because he's standing by his values and tried compromise. She changed her stance, and he's setting boundaries. However, relationships require mutual respect, but if one partner's stance is against evidence-based health decisions, it's a valid concern.\n"
