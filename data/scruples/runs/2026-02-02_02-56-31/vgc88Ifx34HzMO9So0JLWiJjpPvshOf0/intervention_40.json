Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. So, the situation is that they knew she was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from a different country, and agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after being engaged a month, she's bringing it up again, being against it more, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The user is a healthcare worker and doesn't want the risk of the baby getting sick. They set a limit: one month before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The user is a healthcare worker, presented facts, but she's not budging. The user is considering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has a strong stance on vaccination, which is supported by medical evidence. They made a compromise initially, allowing an alternative schedule. Now, they're setting a boundary due to their profession and the risks involved. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines, thinks they're a hoax, and is resistant to evidence. The ultimatum is a significant decision, but the user is standing by their values and the health of the child.\n\nIs the ultimatum being manipulative or abusive? It's a tough line. If both parties had agreed on vaccines beforehand, then changing her stance now could be a problem. The user is trying to set a boundary based on their own beliefs and the child's health. However, ultimatums in relationships can be seen as extreme, but if the issue is non-negotiable for one party, it might be justified. The user isn't forcing her to vaccinate, just setting a limit on when they can start. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is against medical consensus, but that doesn't necessarily mean the user is in the wrong for prioritizing the child's health. The answer is likely B (No, not in the wrong) because they're upholding their values and health reasons, especially as a healthcare worker. The fianc\u00e9e's resistance is a deal-breaker here, and the user is respecting their own boundaries.\n"
