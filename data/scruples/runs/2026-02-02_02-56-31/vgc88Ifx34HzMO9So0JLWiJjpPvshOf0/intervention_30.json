Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. They had previously agreed on some alternative schedule but now she's against vaccines entirely. He's a healthcare worker, so he's probably seen the benefits and risks firsthand. He's giving her an ultimatum because he can't compromise further, and she's upset, calling him manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is that vaccines are a hoax and part of a big pharma scheme. She also seems to have some logical inconsistencies, like not seeing how Hep B would affect a baby she's never had in a medical facility. The user is firm because he's in healthcare and understands the importance of vaccines, even if some schedules are flexible. He's willing to delay the first month but not go beyond that. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong to set a firm boundary on something that affects child health? The user tried to find a middle ground before, but she's now more adamant. He's given her time to adjust or reconsider, but she hasn't. If a relationship has fundamental disagreements that can't be resolved, it's reasonable to set a boundary. However, ultimatums can be seen as harsh, especially in a relationship. \n\nBut vaccines are a public health issue. If she's against them, and he's against that, the conflict might be irresolvable. The user is trying to protect the child's health, which is a parent's duty. The fianc\u00e9e's arguments don't hold water scientifically, but he's tried to present evidence. Since she's not budging, he's left with the choice to walk away. \n\nIn relationships, major disagreements can necessitate tough decisions. If the core values are incompatible, it's not necessarily wrong to prioritize the child's well-being over the relationship. So, in this case, the user might not be at fault because he's protecting the child and has tried to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise despite evidence might make her more at fault here. \n\nBut I should also consider if the ultimatum is too sudden. They've been engaged a month. Maybe she needs more time? But he says she suddenly changed her stance after previously agreeing to work towards vaccination. It seems like she's not being consistent. The user is firm because he can't risk the child's health. So, given all that, the answer leans towards B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
