Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e about vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to some form of vaccination but is now against it entirely. The user is a healthcare worker, so they have a strong personal stance. They want the kids vaccinated but proposed a delayed schedule as a compromise. Now the fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They discussed this before engagement, and she agreed to work towards vaccinations. Now, after a month of being engaged, she's changed her mind. The user's offer is a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. They want to avoid risk, especially since he works in healthcare. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition includes conspiracy theories about big pharma and questioning vaccine efficacy, despite evidence shown to her.\n\nThe core issue is about differing values. The user sees vaccines as essential for child health and safety, while the fianc\u00e9e views them as harmful or a scam. The ultimatum is about setting a boundary. The user is willing to end the relationship if this can't be resolved. The fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and is now upset.\n\nIs the user at fault? Well, ultimatums in relationships are tough. But in this case, the user tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule) and has valid reasons based on health and professional experience. The fianc\u00e9e hasn't budged despite evidence. The user isn't forcing her to vaccinate immediately but wants a compromise that still aligns with their values. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction seems to be about the ultimatum, not the compromise itself. \n\nHowever, relationships require mutual respect and willingness to compromise. If one person is unwilling to budge on a core issue, the other might feel they have no choice but to set a boundary. The user might not be wrong in giving that ultimatum, especially if this is a non-negotiable for them. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings of being pressured could be valid if she feels the ultimatum is too harsh. But given the initial agreement and the user's reasonable compromise, it's more about standing by their principles. So, the answer would be that the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
