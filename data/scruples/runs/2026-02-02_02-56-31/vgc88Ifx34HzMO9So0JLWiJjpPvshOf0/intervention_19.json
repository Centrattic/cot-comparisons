Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. Now she's bringing it up again and opposing Hep B at birth. He's a healthcare worker concerned about risks. He set a limit of one month delay before starting a schedule. She's upset, calling it manipulative, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines, thinks they're a hoax, and he's given her an ultimatum. He wants his kids vaccinated, she's not budging. They had a prior agreement but she's changed her stance.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it right to give an ultimatum? People have different values. Vaccines are a personal choice, but also public health. The user is standing by his decision to ensure his children are protected. He's given some leeway (one month delay) which might be reasonable. However, ultimatums can be seen as harsh, especially in a relationship. But considering the stakes\u2014health of children\u2014it might be justified.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's argument is that he's being manipulative. But if he made his stance clear from the start, maybe she knew this could happen. On the other hand, changing one's mind isn't unheard of, but if they agreed before, she might be going back on that agreement.\n\nPublic health data supports vaccines' safety and efficacy, which he's using to counter her claims. She's holding onto conspiracy theories despite evidence. The user is trying to protect the child, which is a parent's duty.\n\nIn relationships, major disagreements can lead to breaking up. He's trying to be flexible but has a limit. If she won't budge, maybe the ultimatum is necessary. But is it wrong? Well, he's standing by his values and the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, but the user isn't forcing her to vaccinate; he's setting a personal boundary.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because he's setting a clear boundary for his child's health based on their prior discussion and his own professional background. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence might mean the user is justified in his stance.\n"
