Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. So first, I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author mentions that they knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated, but now she's more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants to follow some schedule with a one-month delay at most. They've given her an ultimatum, and she's reacting strongly, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author is confused because they thought they had an agreement before the relationship started.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are consent and communication. The author set a boundary because of their professional background and personal beliefs. They tried to compromise by allowing a slightly delayed schedule. But the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and is now more resistant. \n\nThe author's stance is based on their understanding of vaccine safety and efficacy, supported by data from WHO and CDC. They've tried to provide evidence, but the fianc\u00e9e remains unconvinced, even claiming vaccines are a hoax. This could indicate a fundamental disagreement on core values. \n\nNow, ultimatums in relationships can be tricky. While it's important to respect each other's autonomy, having non-negotiable issues is also common. The author is standing firm on their values, which are important for their children's health. However, the way the ultimatum is presented might be seen as coercive, especially if the fianc\u00e9e feels her autonomy is being stripped. \n\nBut the author did mention they had prior discussions and thought they had mutual understanding. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance might have come as a surprise. The author's position is not about control but about health decisions for future children. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about whether the author overstepped. Since they tried to find middle ground but the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging, the author's ultimatum might be justified if they're unwilling to compromise further. However, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings of being manipulated suggest that the communication could have been handled more sensitively. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether setting a non-negotiable boundary on a health issue is wrong. In many cases, people have such boundaries, especially regarding their children's well-being. The author isn't forcing vaccines but is setting a limit to avoid compromising their child's health. So, it's a matter of differing values, and the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
