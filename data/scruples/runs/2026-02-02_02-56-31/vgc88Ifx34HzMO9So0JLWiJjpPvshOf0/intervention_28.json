Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, some background: They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, so she felt better about not \"overloading\" the baby. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated but with some alternative schedule. Now, after being engaged a month, she's bringing up her opposition again, specifically against Hep B at birth. The fianc\u00e9e doesn't see the need for that vaccine since she's never been in a medical setting, etc. The user, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk, even if low, of the baby contracting Hep B from others. They set a limit: the baby can't go a month before starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative. She initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now refuses to accept the compromise. The user is a healthcare worker, used data from WHO and CDC, showed her studies, but she still doesn't buy it. Now she's upset that he's willing to walk away. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are: prior agreement, compromise offered (alternative schedule with one-month delay), she changed her stance after engagement, and he's standing firm. \n\nThe user's stance is based on health and safety, using data and considering his job as a healthcare worker. The fianc\u00e9e is now opposing, despite initial agreement. The user is giving her an ultimatum because he's at his limit. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about personal values and relationship boundaries. The user is not forcing her to change everything; he's allowing an alternative schedule with a delay. She's not willing to compromise further. The user is standing by his commitment, which he had communicated from the start. \n\nPossible angles: Is it fair to set a boundary on something as critical as vaccines? Did he give her enough time to adjust? Did he handle it respectfully? The user did mention they had previous discussions and she agreed to work towards vaccination. Now she's backtracking. The ultimatum is his maximum, so he's not being unreasonable. She's upset, but he's not crossing into manipulation unless he's pressuring her beyond the compromise. \n\nConsidering the information, it seems the user is in the right because he's setting a clear boundary based on prior agreement and professional experience. His compromise is reasonable, and she's not meeting him halfway. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart after agreement might make her the one at fault. So answer B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
