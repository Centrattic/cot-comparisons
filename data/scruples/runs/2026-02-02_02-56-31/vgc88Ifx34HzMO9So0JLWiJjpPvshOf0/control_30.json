Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum over vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before they got engaged. They discussed alternative schedules, and both agreed the kids would get vaccinated. Now, after a month, she's become more opposed, especially to Hep B at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants to follow some schedule, giving her an ultimatum to accept a modified schedule or face consequences. She's upset, calling him manipulative.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A or B. \n\nI should consider both sides. The author had prior discussions and set boundaries based on his career and beliefs. He's trying to protect the child's health. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e felt they had an agreement, but she changed her stance. The ultimatum might be seen as harsh, but he's standing by his non-negotiable line. \n\nIn relationships, values and non-negotiables are important. If both can't compromise, it's a conflict. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate himself but the children. He's given a timeline (one month) for starting vaccines. She's not budging despite evidence. \n\nPossible angles: Is it reasonable to have non-negotiables in a relationship? The author made his stance clear from the start. She might have thought there was more flexibility. However, he's now enforcing it, leading to conflict. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents have rights to make medical decisions for their children. If they can't agree, it might be a dealbreaker. The author isn't violating any laws but is making a personal choice about his child's healthcare. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's refusal could be seen as not honoring the prior agreement. But maybe she felt pressured or the author's ultimatum is too rigid. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the judgment often looks at who acted without consideration. The author tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedules) but set a boundary. She's now unwilling to accept any compromise, leading to the ultimatum. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. If both can't meet in the middle, it's a tough spot. The author's actions are based on his professional background and desire for his child's protection. However, using an ultimatum can be seen as harsh, but if it's a non-negotiable, maybe it's justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong (B) because he's standing by his non-negotiable, had prior discussions, and tried to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance and refusal to compromise might be the issue. However, the ultimatum could be seen as extreme, but in a relationship where core values clash, it's a valid choice.\n"
