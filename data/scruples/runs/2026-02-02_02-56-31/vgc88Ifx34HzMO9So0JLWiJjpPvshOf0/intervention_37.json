Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed an alternative schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more against vaccines, especially Hep B, and he's given her an ultimatum to accept a modified schedule or else. She's upset, calling him manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to some compromise but now is against it, despite evidence. The user is a healthcare worker concerned about risk, and they can't reconcile their views. He's trying to protect the child's health, she's anti-vaxxers. He's set a clear boundary, and she's not budging. \n\nThe question is whether he's wrong to do that. From a moral standpoint, if someone is in a committed relationship and has discussed this beforehand, setting a firm boundary on something as critical as a child's health could be seen as reasonable. On the other hand, ultimatums can be stressful in relationships. But the user has tried to find middle ground, like an alternative schedule. However, the fianc\u00e9e's stance has shifted, and she's not open to evidence. \n\nHe's a healthcare worker, so he's likely aware of the risks and benefits. She's not just hesitant but believes vaccines are a hoax, which is more extreme. In such cases, where one partner's core values conflict with the other's, especially on health matters, it's hard to say one is entirely wrong. However, the user is prioritizing the child's health based on evidence, which many would support. \n\nBut ultimatums can be seen as controlling. However, given the context, he's not forcing her to take the vaccines but setting a boundary for his own comfort. If she was aware of his stance initially, then changing her mind later might complicate things. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, not in the wrong). He's standing his ground on a health issue that's important to him, and he's tried to compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's shift in position complicates the situation, but he's not at fault for setting a boundary.\n"
