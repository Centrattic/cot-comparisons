Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e over vaccines. They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules before, like maybe a different country's schedule, but agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's against it again, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The user is a healthcare worker and wants to minimize risks. They set a limit that the baby can't start any delayed schedule beyond a month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The user says they were clear from the start about wanting vaccinated children, and she agreed to work towards it but now isn't. He's stuck between not wanting to end things but also not backing down.\n\nSo, the main question is whether giving an ultimatum on such a crucial issue is the wrong move. Factors to consider: mutual understanding, compromise, and respect. They had a prior agreement, but she's changed her stance. The user is firm because of his job and health concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are anti-vax beliefs, which he's tried to counter with data but she's not budging. The ultimatum is a firm line he's not willing to cross. \n\nIn relationships, major life decisions require compromise. But when one's stance is based on misinformation and the other has valid health concerns, where's the balance? If they had an agreement, maybe the user's expectations were clear, and the fianc\u00e9e's shift is a problem. However, ultimatums can be seen as controlling if not given with proper discussion. But considering the user's profession and the health risks, he might feel justified. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might show she didn't take the initial discussions seriously. \n\nSo, was the user in the wrong? It's a tough call. If they had a prior understanding and she agreed but now refuses, the user's standing his ground isn't necessarily wrong. But ultimatums can be harsh. However, since the user tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule with a month delay) and she rejected it, his stance is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e might be in the wrong for not honoring the initial agreement and being inflexible. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
