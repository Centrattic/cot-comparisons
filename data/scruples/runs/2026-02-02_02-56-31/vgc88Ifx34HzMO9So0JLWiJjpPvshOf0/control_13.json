Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and now opposes vaccinating their future children, leading the author to give an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e's stance before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated but perhaps on a different schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author's stance is that they can't go beyond a one-month delay before starting any schedule. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and abusive because of the ultimatum, even though the author had mentioned their stance earlier in the relationship.\n\nThe author is a healthcare worker, so they have a professional perspective on the importance of vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has expressed anti-vaccine sentiments, citing conspiracy theories and distrust in pharmaceutical companies. The author tried to provide evidence from WHO and CDC, but she's not swayed. The author is now considering walking away if she can't accept the compromise.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's position is based on medical evidence and their professional background. They tried to find a middle ground by allowing a delayed schedule. However, the fianc\u00e9e's opposition is rooted in misinformation. The ultimatum could be seen as a firm stance on an important issue. But some might argue that giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as controlling, even if the topic is important. However, the author had previously communicated their position, so maybe it's reasonable to set boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e had agreed earlier to work towards vaccination, so changing her stance now could be an issue. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate, just setting a maximum delay. It's about the future children's health, which is a significant concern. \n\nI think the key here is whether the ultimatum is reasonable given the circumstances. The author isn't forcing her to do anything except accept a compromise they had already discussed. Since the fianc\u00e9e is refusing to budge despite prior agreement, the author isn't necessarily wrong in standing their ground. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
