Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative vaccination schedules, maybe even one from another country. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated in some form. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. She's given the example that she can't see how a baby would contract Hep B unless she's positive, which she's not. The author is a healthcare worker and is concerned about risk, so he sets an ultimatum: the baby can't wait more than a month before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. She had previously agreed to work towards vaccination, but now she's against it. The author is a healthcare worker and has checked data from WHO and CDC, showing that diseases are more likely than vaccine complications. Even with evidence, she's adamant, saying it's a big pharma ploy and vaccines don't work. The author is now giving her an ultimatum and considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author had prior discussions about vaccination with the fianc\u00e9e before proposing. They had an agreement on some sort of schedule. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance. The author, being in healthcare, is concerned about the baby's health and the risk of disease. He's given a compromise of a one-month delay. The fianc\u00e9e is reacting strongly, calling it manipulative. The author is sticking to his position because he's seen data and evidence, but she's not convinced by facts.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to assess if his actions are reasonable given the circumstances. The author is making a decision based on his professional experience and the data he's reviewed. He's given a compromise that he's willing to accept, which is a one-month deferral. However, the fianc\u00e9e is not willing to agree and her stance is based on misinformation (like vaccines being a hoax, big pharma conspiracy). \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, when two people have fundamentally different values that affect their children's health, it's a significant issue. The author is clear from the start about his non-negotiable stance on vaccination, which the fianc\u00e9e had initially agreed to work with. Now she's changing her position, which could indicate a lack of commitment to the agreement they had. \n\nThe author is not forcing her to accept his view but is setting boundaries based on his beliefs. He's offering a middle ground (alternative schedule after one month) which he's willing to accept. However, the fianc\u00e9e is not budging and is now accusing him of being manipulative. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone's health choices put others at risk (in this case, the child), it's a valid concern. The author is trying to protect the child from preventable diseases, which is a parental responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e's belief that vaccines are ineffective and a hoax is not supported by scientific evidence, so the author is justified in his concern.\n\nHowever, giving an ultimatum could be seen as extreme. But considering the importance of vaccination for public health and the child's well-being, it's a reasonable stance. The author is not forcing her to vaccinate immediately but is allowing a month's delay. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is based on misinformation, so the author's position is defensible.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. He's standing by his values and making a decision in the best interest of the child, given his profession and the data. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart and refusal to consider evidence is the issue here.\n"
