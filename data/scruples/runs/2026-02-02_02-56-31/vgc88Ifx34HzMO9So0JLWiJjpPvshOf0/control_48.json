Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated when they got engaged. They had discussed alternative schedules before, maybe from another country. The author is a healthcare worker, so they probably have strong opinions about vaccines. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines than before, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author sets a firm limit: a one-month delay before starting any alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe author says they had agreed before that the kids would be vaccinated. Now the fianc\u00e9e is backing out. The author tried to show data from WHO and CDC, but she doesn't believe it, citing Big Pharma conspiracies. The author is okay with walking away if she won't agree to the one-month delay for the alternative schedule.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about both sides. On one hand, vaccines are a personal choice, and the author is pushing for a specific schedule. But on the other hand, the author is setting boundaries for their own children. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, and the author is standing by their compromise. \n\nThe author gave some flexibility with the one-month delay, which is a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is unwilling to budge and is accusing the author of being abusive. Since the author had already discussed this before getting engaged, maybe the fianc\u00e9e should have considered this when committing. The author is trying to protect the child's health based on their profession and research. \n\nBut is it right to give an ultimatum in a relationship? Relationships require compromise, but sometimes there are non-negotiables. If the author believes that vaccinating their child is essential, it's their right to set that boundary. However, the ultimatum could be seen as extreme if the fianc\u00e9e wasn't fully on board from the start. \n\nWait, the author mentions that before the relationship, they told the fianc\u00e9e they would never change their stance on vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards it. Now she's changed her position. So maybe the author isn't wrong for holding their ground when the fianc\u00e9e's stance has shifted. The author tried to find a middle ground but now is offering a compromise. If the fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to accept even that, then the author isn't the one being unreasonable. \n\nAlso, the author is a healthcare worker, which might add credibility to their stance. The fianc\u00e9e's arguments about Big Pharma and vaccines not working are based on misinformation. The author has tried to provide evidence but she's not listening. In that case, the author is protecting the child's health based on professional knowledge. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author is not making the argument personal but trying to make a health decision for their child. The fianc\u00e9e is the one who changed her mind and isn't accepting the compromise. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary here. The answer would be B.\n"
