Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. He's a healthcare worker and wants the kids vaccinated. He gave her an ultimatum: either vaccinate within a month or he'd walk away. She's upset, calling it manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e's stance on vaccines is based on personal beliefs, even though there's scientific evidence against her claims. The user has valid concerns about public health and his own risk as a healthcare worker. They had an agreement before the engagement, but now she's backing out. The user is firm because he can't compromise on the core issue of vaccination.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, ultimatums in relationships can be tough. But the user is standing by his non-negotiable boundary. He tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule) and she's not accepting it. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position after agreeing to work towards vaccination. The user's stance is about protecting their future children's health. However, coercion isn't healthy in relationships. But in this case, since he's given a compromise and she's not budging, maybe his ultimatum is his way of enforcing what he believes is necessary.\n\nBut maybe the problem is that he's giving an ultimatum over something that's a personal choice for her. However, vaccines involve public health and safety, which he's concerned about. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal is based on misinformation, which complicates things. The user has tried to educate her but she's not listening. So, is he wrong for not compromising further? Or is she wrong for not upholding their previous agreement?\n\nIn terms of morality, it's about mutual respect and health. The user isn't forcing her to vaccinate himself, but he's setting boundaries for their children. If she can't meet those, the relationship can't proceed as he envisioned. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's standing by his convictions after trying to find a middle ground. However, some might argue that the ultimatum is harsh. But given the circumstances, his position is understandable.\n"
