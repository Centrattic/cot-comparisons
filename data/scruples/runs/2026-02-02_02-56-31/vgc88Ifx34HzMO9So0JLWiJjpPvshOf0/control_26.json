Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to his fianc\u00e9e over vaccines. The situation is that they discussed vaccines before getting engaged, agreed on some alternative schedule, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines than before. The author, a healthcare worker, is firm on vaccinating their future child and has given an ultimatum: either follow a modified schedule starting at one month or break up. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had prior discussions and an agreement. The author made a compromise by allowing a delayed schedule, which is a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e now is more resistant, even dismissing evidence and data. The author is standing by his decision because he values vaccination based on his professional background and risk assessment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, ultimatums in relationships are always tough. But the author had a prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, which the author is trying to address. The ultimatum is about a non-negotiable issue for him\u2014child health. But was giving an ultimatum too harsh? Maybe. Relationships require compromise, but there are lines people won't cross. The author isn't forcing her; he's setting boundaries based on his convictions. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, isn't budging despite prior agreement. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is grounded in public health data, which he's justified by citing WHO and CDC. The fianc\u00e9e's beliefs (anti-vaxxers) are a red flag, especially with potential risks to the child. The author as a healthcare worker has a professional stake here. But is it right to end a relationship over this? It's a matter of personal values. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries he can't compromise on. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be overblown if she knew this was a dealbreaker all along. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He tried to find a middle ground, communicated his stance early, and is standing by it. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart without considering the prior agreement could be the issue here.\n"
