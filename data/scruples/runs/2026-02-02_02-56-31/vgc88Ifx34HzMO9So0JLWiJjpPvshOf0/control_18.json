Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is anti-vax, and the author gives her an ultimatum about vaccinating their future children. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they had prior discussions about vaccines before getting engaged, agreeing to an alternative schedule. Now, after the engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, specifically the Hep B at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets an ultimatum: the baby can't go a month without starting vaccinations. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author is conflicted but stands by their decision.\n\nSo, the key points are: prior agreement, differing views on vaccines, ultimatum given. The author is firm because of their healthcare background and the risk of not vaccinating. The fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and maybe betrayed. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, both sides have valid concerns. The author is standing up for their values and health of the child, which is a parent's right. They tried to compromise with an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, and the author felt it's necessary to set a boundary. But giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as extreme. However, the author tried to find middle ground first. \n\nIn terms of ethics, parents have a responsibility to protect their children's health. The author's stance is based on medical evidence, while the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are anti-vax. If the author can't compromise further without compromising their child's health, then it's a justified ultimatum. But if the ultimatum is too rigid without room for other considerations, maybe. However, the author did allow a one-month delay, which is a compromise. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're protecting their child's health and set boundaries after prior discussion. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance might not be addressed by the author, but the author's decision is based on their values and health reasons. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
