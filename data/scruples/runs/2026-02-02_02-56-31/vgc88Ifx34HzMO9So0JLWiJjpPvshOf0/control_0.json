Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again carefully.\n\nThe user is a fianc\u00e9 who knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative vaccination schedules, maybe from a different country, to accommodate her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed on some plan. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing it up again, being more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth. The fianc\u00e9 is a healthcare worker and is concerned about the baby's safety, giving her an ultimatum: either start vaccinations within a month or follow an alternative schedule, but he can't go beyond that. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. Both were aware of the issue before the engagement. They had discussions and agreements earlier. Now, she's changing her stance. The user is a healthcare worker, which might influence his perspective on vaccines. He's given her a specific deadline and a compromise (delaying by a month but then following a schedule), but she's not happy and sees it as an ultimatum. He's also provided data and evidence, but she's not convinced, even bringing up conspiracy theories about Big Pharma.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of ethics and relationships, giving an ultimatum is a serious matter. However, the author mentions that they had prior agreements. He's trying to find a middle ground by allowing a one-month delay before starting a schedule. But she's now opposing it more than before. The author is standing his ground because he's concerned about the health of the child and possibly their own safety as a healthcare worker. \n\nBut is he wrong for setting a boundary? In relationships, it's common for partners to have differing opinions and need to compromise. However, when it comes to health decisions, especially for children, personal beliefs can clash. If the author had already made it clear before the engagement that he wanted his children vaccinated, and she agreed, then he's following through on that. However, if the ultimatum is seen as controlling or manipulative, especially if she felt pressured, then he might be at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, he's making a reasonable compromise by allowing a delay, which is a middle ground. She's now backtracking, which could be seen as her not being honest about her true stance. The fact that she's calling him abusive might be an overreaction. Also, he's presented evidence, but she's holding to conspiracy theories, which complicates the issue.\n\nIn terms of societal views, vaccines are generally supported by medical communities, and refusing them can be seen as neglectful. However, respecting personal autonomy is also important. The author is trying to protect the child's health, which is a parent's responsibility. But the method of an ultimatum might be too harsh.\n\nBut considering they had prior discussions and she agreed to work towards vaccination, the author is sticking to his principles. The question is whether the ultimatum is justified. Since he's given a compromise (one month delay), perhaps it's reasonable. However, some might argue that in a relationship, ultimatums can be destructive regardless of the issue. Others might say that when it comes to health decisions, it's necessary to have boundaries.\n\nI think the key here is that both knew about each other's positions before the engagement. The author isn't entirely wrong for standing up for his beliefs, especially regarding the health of their child. However, the way he's handling it (ultimatum) might be problematic. But since he's making a compromise (the one-month delay), it's a middle ground. She's the one who changed her stance post-engagement. So, in terms of being in the wrong, maybe the author isn't wrong because he's standing by his principles and had prior agreement. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
