Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who's unvaccinated and the author is a healthcare worker. They had discussed vaccines before getting engaged, and there was an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated, maybe on an alternative schedule. Now the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth, and the author gives her an ultimatum: accept the delayed alternative schedule or it's over.\n\nFirst, the author knew about her stance before proposing, so he wasn't blindsiding her. They had prior discussions about alternative schedules. The author's reasoning is based on his profession and wanting to protect the child from preventable diseases. He's given her a compromise\u2014wait a month before starting the schedule. But she's now upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. She had previously agreed to work towards vaccination, so maybe she changed her mind later. The author is trying to stand his ground because he's firm on vaccinations. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a health standpoint, vaccines are a proven way to prevent diseases. The author is trying to protect their future children, which is a valid concern. He's also a healthcare worker, so he's likely aware of the risks of not vaccinating. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship is a big step. But the fianc\u00e9e had already agreed to some form of vaccination schedule earlier. Now she's backing out, possibly due to misinformation or changing her stance. The author's compromise is a month delay, which is a middle ground. If she's unwilling to meet anywhere and insists on no vaccines, then the author's stance is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that giving an ultimatum in a committed relationship is extreme, especially if it's based on differing opinions. But the author's priority is the child's health, which is a significant factor. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence might make the author's position the right one. So considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because he's protecting the child's health and had prior discussions. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position without considering the agreement they had. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
