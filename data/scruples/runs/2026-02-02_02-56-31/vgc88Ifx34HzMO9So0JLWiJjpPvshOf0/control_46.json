Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and against vaccinating their future children. The author agreed to an alternative schedule initially, but now she's more opposed, even to Hep B at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and gave a one-month delay as the maximum. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative, and the author is considering walking away if she doesn't comply.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the ultimatum, the fianc\u00e9e's prior knowledge and agreement, and the author's stance on vaccines. The author mentions they discussed this before proposing, agreed on following some schedule, but now she's backing out. The author's ultimatum is based on their professional background and concerns about risk, which they find valid. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence and the author's compromise might be a problem.\n\nBut does giving an ultimatum over a significant decision like vaccines make the author wrong? It depends on the context. If both made an agreement beforehand, and the author is holding to their boundary, it's a matter of differing values. Vaccines are a personal choice but also a critical health issue. The author is prioritizing their values and the child's health, which they have a right to do. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is not honoring the prior agreement, leading to conflict. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key, but both parties must meet somewhere. If the author has made a firm decision based on their beliefs and the fianc\u00e9e won't compromise, the author isn't necessarily wrong for upholding their stance. The issue is whether the ultimatum is fair. Since they discussed it before and she agreed in principle, the author isn't acting out of nowhere. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart complicates things, but the author isn't the one being inconsistent here.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. They set a boundary based on prior agreement and their professional understanding. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about the ultimatum itself, but the author's position is valid given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
