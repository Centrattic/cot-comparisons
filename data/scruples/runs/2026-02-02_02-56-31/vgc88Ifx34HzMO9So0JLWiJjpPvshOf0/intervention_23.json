Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed a compromise. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more against vaccines, especially the Hep B one. He's a healthcare worker and wants to stick to a schedule, but she thinks it's a hoax and they don't work. He offered a month delay, but she's upset and calls him manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now is against it. The user felt they had to set a firm line because of health risks. He provided reasons and data from WHO and CDC, but she's not budging. The question is about whether he's at fault for the ultimatum.\n\nIn relationships, compromises are important. They had a prior agreement, and she changed her stance. The user is standing by his principles, which he communicated early. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as harsh, but if it's a deal-breaker, maybe it's justified. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept the compromise might indicate she's not willing to meet in the middle. The user is a healthcare worker, so he's aware of the risks, which adds weight to his position.\n\nBut, is the ultimatum fair? If the original compromise was to follow a schedule, and he's now offering a slight delay, but she's not on board, maybe it's his right to walk away. However, some might argue that he should have found another way to compromise further. However, given her unwillingness to accept any evidence, maybe he's justified in not backing down. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he communicated his stance early, tried to find a middle ground, and she changed her position. The key is that he gave a reasonable compromise and she rejected it, making him not at fault.\n"
