Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. First, I need to understand the context. They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing, and they had discussed an alternative schedule. Now she's more against vaccines, even bringing up the Hep B example. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe user is a healthcare worker concerned about risks, and they've set a limit: one month before starting an alternative schedule. They\u2019ve tried to present data from WHO and CDC, but she still doesn't buy it. He\u2019s ready to walk away if she doesn\u2019t agree. The question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nHmm. Let's think about ultimatums in relationships. People have different values, and when it comes to children's health, it's a big deal. The user had prior discussions, so he's not coming out of nowhere. He's set a boundary, which is his right. But ultimatums can be seen as controlling, but if it's about health and safety, maybe it's justified. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's stance is that vaccines are a hoax and don't work. That's a strong position, and he's tried to counter with evidence. However, she's holding onto conspiracy theories. In relationships, both parties should compromise, but if one partner is non-negotiable on a critical health issue, is that acceptable?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the user is protecting the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e is being anti-vax despite evidence. The user is giving her a choice, which is a reasonable approach given the stakes. So, is he wrong? Maybe not. He's standing by his values and health beliefs. The key here is whether setting a firm boundary is wrong. I think it's a personal choice, but if it's causing the breakup, it's a hard situation. But in terms of right or wrong, the user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing the child's health and setting a limit. So, answer B.\n"
