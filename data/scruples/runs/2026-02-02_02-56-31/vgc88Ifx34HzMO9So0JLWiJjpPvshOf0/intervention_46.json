Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e about vaccines. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they had a prior discussion before proposing, where they agreed that the kids would be vaccinated but maybe on an alternative schedule. Now, after a month of being engaged, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B at birth. The user, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets a limit: the baby can't go without vaccines for more than a month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The user is confused because they thought they had an agreement and now want to know if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are prior agreement vs. changing stance. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now refuses. The user's ultimatum is specific and time-bound. They're not saying no vaccines ever, just a delay of a month. The fianc\u00e9e's current stance seems more anti-vax, citing conspiracy theories. The user is trying to balance their medical knowledge and concerns with the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs.\n\nIs the user wrong for setting a boundary? Well, they made it clear from the start that vaccinated kids were non-negotiable. If the fianc\u00e9e can't honor that agreement, then the user has a right to walk away. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme, but given the health risks and prior discussions, maybe it's justified. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden opposition might be a dealbreaker. The user isn't forcing vaccines; they're allowing an alternative schedule with a delay. So, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong), because they're upholding a previously agreed-upon compromise and setting a clear boundary to protect their children's health.\n"
