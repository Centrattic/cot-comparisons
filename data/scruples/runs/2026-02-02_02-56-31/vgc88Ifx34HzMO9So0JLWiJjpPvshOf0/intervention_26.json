Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. Now, after a month of engagement, she's become more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine. The user is a healthcare worker concerned about risks and set a limit of one month before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and threatening to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both viewpoints. The user has strong reasons based on their profession and understanding of vaccine safety and efficacy. They tried to compromise by allowing a delayed or alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is that vaccines are a hoax and don't work, despite presented evidence. She initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now refuses.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, ultimatums in relationships can be tricky. They might be seen as extreme, but the user's position is about their non-negotiable boundary for their future children's health. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise despite prior agreements and evidence could mean she's not being reasonable. However, the user's approach of giving an ultimatum might come across as controlling, even if their intent is protective. The fianc\u00e9e's emotional reaction and the term \"abusive\" suggest she feels pressured, which is a valid concern even if the user's intent is good.\n\nOn the other hand, if the user has made their stance clear from the start and tried to find middle ground, it's their right to set boundaries. The fianc\u00e9e changing her position significantly after agreeing to discuss it could be the root of the problem. The user isn't forcing vaccines but setting a firm limit on compromise. The key is whether the ultimatum is a reasonable boundary or an overreach. Since the user is a healthcare worker, their knowledge adds weight to their concerns. However, the method of delivering the ultimatum and the fianc\u00e9e's perception of manipulation matters. It's possible both have valid points but are at an impasse. The question is whether the user's actions are justified. Given the information, I think the user isn't in the wrong because they made their stance clear and tried to meet halfway. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to engage with evidence and the ultimatum being a final compromise point makes the user's position defensible. So, answer B.\n"
