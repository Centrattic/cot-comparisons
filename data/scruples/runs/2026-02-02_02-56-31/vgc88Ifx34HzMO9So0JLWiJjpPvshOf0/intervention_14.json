Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e about vaccinating their future children. They provided a detailed scenario where they knew she was unvaccinated before proposing, and they had discussed a compromise. Now, she's more opposed, and he's giving her an ultimatum of a one-month delay before starting vaccines. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9e was initially on board with a compromise but has since changed her stance, despite evidence and discussions. The user is a healthcare worker, so they have a professional perspective on vaccines. They've tried presenting data and logical arguments but she's not budging. He's giving her a clear boundary, which she perceives as an ultimatum. \n\nThe question is whether he's at fault. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to their beliefs, but when it comes to children's health, parents often have to make decisions. If one parent is firmly against vaccines and the other can't accept that, it's a conflict of values. The user is setting a boundary based on their convictions. \n\nHowever, ultimatums can be seen as controlling, especially in a relationship. But if the issue is non-negotiable for the user (children must be vaccinated), then it's about differing priorities. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, but the user is standing by their principles. \n\nConsidering that the fianc\u00e9e was aware upfront and agreed initially, but then changed her mind without valid evidence, the user's stance might be justified. The key is whether giving an ultimatum is fair. Since both sides are not meeting in the middle, the user is protecting their values, which could be seen as reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because he's upholding his values and protecting the child's health, even if the method is confrontational.\n"
