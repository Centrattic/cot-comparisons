Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e about vaccines. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they knew she was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed a modified vaccine schedule, maybe an alternative one from another country, to address her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing up her strong opposition again, especially against the Hepatitis B vaccine at birth. She argues that since she's never been in a medical setting and has no lab records, the baby can't contract Hep B, but the user is okay with the schedule. The user, a healthcare worker, is willing to let the baby wait a month before starting an alternative schedule but can't go beyond that. The fianc\u00e9e is now calling the user manipulative and abusive for giving her an ultimatum. The user mentions that they had already discussed this before the relationship started, and she agreed to work towards it. Now she's changed her stance despite data and arguments presented.\n\nThe user is a healthcare worker, which probably influences their stance on vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e is anti-vax, thinks vaccines are a hoax, and despite evidence, remains adamant. The user feels they've given a compromise, allowing a delayed schedule, but the fianc\u00e9e is upset. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for setting this ultimatum.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user has a strong case because they've already made their position clear, and they're offering a compromise that might accommodate both parties' concerns. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is not budging despite the user's concessions. The user's ultimatum is about their non-negotiable stance on their children's health, which is a significant factor in a marriage. Since the user has tried to find a middle ground and the fianc\u00e9e refuses to compromise, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, ultimatums in relationships can be tricky because they can feel controlling. But given the context, especially the health of future children, the user's position might be justified. The fianc\u00e9e changing her stance and the user having already discussed this before the engagement complicates things. The user's actions are about protecting the children's health, which is a valid concern. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
