Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. Now she's bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine. The user is a healthcare worker and is concerned about the risk of their kids getting sick, so they set a limit: a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user is standing firm on their belief in vaccination schedules, even allowing for a slight delay. The fianc\u00e9e has strong anti-vax views, even after being presented with data from WHO and CDC, and examples of diseases resurfacing. She's been resistant to factual information, bringing in conspiracy theories about Big Pharma. The user is a medical professional, so their concerns are valid from a health perspective. They are setting boundaries based on what they can accept, and they want to find a middle ground but not at the expense of their children's health.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in stance might be a problem. If she previously agreed to work towards vaccination and now is refusing entirely, that's a shift. The user is giving a compromise (one-month delay, alternative schedule), which might not be enough for her. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for having such a strict boundary. \n\nIn relationships, when there's a deal-breaker, especially involving health and safety of children, it's sometimes necessary. The user isn't refusing vaccination entirely but is allowing a small window. The fianc\u00e9e is now unwilling to meet even that. While ultimatums can be stressful, if one partner is non-negotiable on something crucial, the other isn't wrong for setting a line. \n\nBut is giving an ultimatum too harsh? It depends on the context. If they had agreed before, and now she's breaking that, the user has a right to enforce their boundary. However, the user should ensure that their stance is firm but respectful. The fianc\u00e9e's claims about vaccines not working and being a hoax are scientifically unfounded, so the user's pushback is justified. \n\nThe key points: prior discussion and agreement, the user's compromise, the fianc\u00e9e's reversal with no valid reasoning. The user's role as a healthcare worker adds weight to their concern for health risks. The answer likely is B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if the ultimatum was reasonable. Since they're allowing a small delay and alternative schedule, it's a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to meet that ground and her accusations of manipulation might indicate she's the one not in the right.\n"
