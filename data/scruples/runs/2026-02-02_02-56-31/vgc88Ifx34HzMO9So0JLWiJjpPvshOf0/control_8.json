Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is at fault for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that he knew his fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated somehow. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. He's a healthcare worker, so he's concerned about risks and wants to start the schedule within a month. He's given her an ultimatum, and she's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. He's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: prior discussion and agreement, his stance as a healthcare worker, her changing position, and the ultimatum. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nOn one hand, he had a prior agreement. He's standing by his decision, which is about the health of their future children. He's given her some flexibility with an alternative schedule and a one-month delay. On the other hand, she's now against it entirely, even after being informed and presented with data. He's giving her an ultimatum, which can be seen as a strict decision without compromise.\n\nBut ultimatums in relationships can be problematic because they leave no room for negotiation. However, in this case, he's already made concessions (alternative schedule, one-month delay). He's in a position where his core value is non-negotiable: vaccinating the children. She's unwilling to budge despite the evidence. \n\nThe ethical angle here is that both parties need to respect each other's values. If he can't compromise on this, then giving an ultimatum might be justified. But some might argue that he should try to understand her fears better or seek counseling. However, she's already dismissed data and is set in her beliefs. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if he's clear about his stance from the start and she agreed, then he's acting on that agreement. But if she's changed her mind after being engaged, maybe he's right to enforce the original agreement. However, using an ultimatum can feel harsh, but in cases where health is a concern, it's a tough call.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because he's standing by a prior agreement and his health beliefs, especially when she's unwilling to compromise despite prior discussions. But some might argue that the ultimatum is too strict. However, given the circumstances, B (not in the wrong) seems more appropriate.\n"
