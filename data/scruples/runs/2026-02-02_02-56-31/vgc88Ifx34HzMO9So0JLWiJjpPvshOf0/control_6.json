Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a vaccine ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, the background: The fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and initially agreed to follow an alternative schedule. The author, a healthcare worker, is pro-vaccines and has set a condition that the baby must get vaccinated within a month, otherwise he'd walk away. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author had prior discussions and set boundaries, which is understandable, especially since they work in healthcare and want to minimize risks. Vaccines are a significant public health issue, and the author's stance is based on evidence. However, the fianc\u00e9e changed her position after the engagement, which might be a problem. \n\nIn relationships, major decisions require mutual agreement. The author gave a fair compromise, like a delayed schedule, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging. The ultimatum is a serious step, but given the importance of child health, maybe it's justified. \n\nOn the other hand, could the author have found a middle ground? They tried providing data, but she's anti-vax for ideological reasons. If she's not willing to meet halfway, the author's stance might be reasonable. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation are questionable since the author was upfront from the start. The ultimatum isn't about control but about non-negotiable health values. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made compromises and tried to reason, so Answer B makes sense.\n"
