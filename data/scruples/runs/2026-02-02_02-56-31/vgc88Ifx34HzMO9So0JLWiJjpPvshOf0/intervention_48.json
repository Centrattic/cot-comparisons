Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. They knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more against vaccines, especially the Hep B at birth. He's a healthcare worker concerned about risks and wants to start vaccines within a month. She's upset, saying he's manipulative and abusive. He doesn't want to end the relationship but can't compromise further.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is that vaccines are a hoax and she doesn't trust them, despite evidence. The user is firm because of his job and the health risks he's aware of. He's given a compromise before (alternative schedules) but now feels he can't go further. He's given her an ultimatum, which she's taking as a negative.\n\nIs the ultimatum wrong? Well, they had agreed before on vaccinations with a schedule. Now she's changed her position. He's trying to meet her halfway with a one-month delay. But she's not budging. He's a healthcare worker, which adds credibility to his concerns. She's holding onto conspiracy theories despite presented data. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to compromise. If she agreed before but is now refusing, maybe she's not being fair. The user is setting a boundary for his values. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme. But if he's willing to walk away rather than compromise on something he considers important for their children's health, maybe it's justified. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's argument that he's manipulative might stem from feeling pressured. But if he's been clear from the start and she's accepted it before, then changed her mind, maybe she's the one not respecting the previous agreement. \n\nI think the key points are the initial agreement, her change of heart, and his job-related concerns. The user isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary he's comfortable with, especially when she's not providing any middle ground. So answer B.\n"
