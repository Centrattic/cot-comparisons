Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author mentions they knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. But now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risks of not vaccinating and sets an ultimatum: either follow an alternative schedule starting after one month or the author will walk away. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nSo, the key points here are: prior agreement, change in fianc\u00e9e's stance post-engagement, the author's ultimatum, and the fianc\u00e9e's reaction. \n\nI need to consider whether the author overstepped. The author had already discussed and compromised before, so setting a clear boundary might be reasonable. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as extreme. But vaccines are a significant health issue. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to vaccinate despite evidence and the author's profession as a healthcare worker adds context.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's arguments about vaccines being a hoax and big pharma might indicate a lack of willingness to engage in a rational discussion. The author tried to provide data, but she isn't budging. In such cases, respecting each other's values is crucial in a relationship. If both have non-negotiables, the author's stance could be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, ultimatums can strain relationships. However, the author did mention their stance early on, and the fianc\u00e9e had agreed before. Now she's changing her position. The author is trying to protect the child's health, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because they set boundaries based on prior agreements and their professional concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's shift in stance and refusal to compromise could mean the author is justified in their ultimatum. But I need to be careful here. The answer could be B (Not in the wrong). Alternatively, some might argue the ultimatum is too harsh, but given the importance of the issue and prior discussions, B seems more likely.\n"
