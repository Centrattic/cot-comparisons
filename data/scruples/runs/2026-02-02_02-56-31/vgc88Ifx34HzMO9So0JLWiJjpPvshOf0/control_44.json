Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about vaccines and an ultimatum given to their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks from unvaccinated people around the baby. They set an ultimatum: the baby can't wait more than a month before starting some alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is standing by their stance on vaccines, which is a personal choice. They've tried to compromise with an alternative schedule but have a limit. The fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines believing them to be a hoax, not budging even with presented evidence. The author is a healthcare worker, which adds credibility to their concern about preventable diseases. However, setting an ultimatum can be seen as firm, but maybe justified given the importance of vaccinations.\n\nNow, ethical aspects. In relationships, major disagreements can lead to breaking up. If both can't compromise, it's a personal choice. The author tried to find a middle ground but has a limit. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to consider any schedule might be a deal-breaker. The author isn't forcing vaccination but setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated, but the author is stating their non-negotiable line.\n\nI should check if the author overstepped. They gave a clear ultimatum after prior discussion. The fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards vaccination before, but now refuses. The author's stance is based on protecting the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's belief in vaccines being a hoax is a strong opposing view. The author isn't wrong in standing by their decision, especially in a healthcare context. However, some might argue that giving an ultimatum is extreme, but considering the health risk, it's understandable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they've tried to find a compromise and set a reasonable limit based on their beliefs and profession. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge is the main issue here.\n"
