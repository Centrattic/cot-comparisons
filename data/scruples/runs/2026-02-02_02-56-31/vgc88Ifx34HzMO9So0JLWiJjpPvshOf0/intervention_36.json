Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. So first, I need to understand the situation they described.\n\nThey mentioned that they knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. They came to an agreement that the kids would be vaccinated following some schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The fianc\u00e9e isn't in any medical facilities, so the risk seems low. The user is a healthcare worker and wants to avoid any risk of bringing diseases home. They set an ultimatum: the baby can't go more than a month without starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The user tried to provide data from WHO and CDC, but she still doesn't believe and thinks it's a big pharma conspiracy. Now she's up in arms, and the user is considering breaking up if she doesn't agree.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. They're asking for an answer of A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the user is standing firm on their beliefs about vaccines, which are supported by scientific consensus. They had prior discussions and made compromises, like the alternative schedule. The ultimatum is about their personal boundary regarding their children's health. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and believes the ultimatum is manipulative. She might feel that the user isn't respecting her autonomy or her deeply held beliefs, even if they're based on misinformation. The user's actions could be seen as controlling if they force her to choose between her beliefs and the relationship.\n\nBut the user also has the right to make decisions about their children's health. Vaccines are a critical public health measure, and delaying beyond a month might expose the baby to preventable diseases. The user is in a position of authority in healthcare, so their stance is informed. However, ultimatums can strain relationships, especially when one person feels their values are being attacked. The key is whether the user is wrong for setting a boundary they're comfortable with, given the health implications.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to compromise. If the user has already made concessions (alternative schedules) and the fianc\u00e9e is still resistant, maybe the user isn't wrong in setting a firm line. But if the ultimatum is too rigid without room for further discussion, that could be seen as harsh. However, the user has tried multiple times to provide evidence, and she's not budging. At some point, making a decision based on one's values is necessary. The user isn't forcing her to vaccinate immediately; they're allowing a month for an alternative schedule. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they're protecting their children's health based on their beliefs and profession, even if it leads to the breakup. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to engage with evidence might make the ultimatum justified.\n"
