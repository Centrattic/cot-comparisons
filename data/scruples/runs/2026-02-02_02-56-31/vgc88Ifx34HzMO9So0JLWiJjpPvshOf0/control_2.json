Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong regarding the vaccine ultimatum situation with his fianc\u00e9e. Let me break down the scenario first.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated, and they had previously discussed alternative vaccination schedules, maybe following another country's approach. The author is a healthcare worker, which probably makes him more aware of vaccine safety. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed to vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author sets an ultimatum: the baby can't be unvaccinated for more than a month before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. She had agreed earlier to work towards vaccination but now isn't. The author is firm, citing data and pointing out her conspiracy theories about big pharma. He's willing to walk away if she doesn't agree.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author had prior discussions and gave some flexibility. He's in a healthcare field, so his concerns are valid. He's trying to protect the child's health based on scientific consensus. On the other hand, giving an ultimatum can feel controlling, especially in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9e might feel her autonomy is being dismissed, especially if she's changed her stance. But did he have prior agreement? He mentions they agreed on vaccination but with alternative schedules. Now he's setting a firm line. Is that reasonable?\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on misinformation, which he's tried to counter with data. However, when someone is entrenched in their beliefs, data might not change their mind. The ultimatum could be seen as necessary because the author's stance is non-negotiable. But relationships require compromise. If both can't meet in the middle, it's a problem. The author is prioritizing his values, but is it fair to make it an ultimatum?\n\nAnother angle: the Hep B vaccine at birth\u2014since she's not a carrier and has no risk factors, maybe there's a middle ground. But the author is a healthcare worker and might have a lower tolerance for risk. The key here is whether the ultimatum is justified given their prior discussions and the potential health risks of not vaccinating. The author isn't refusing vaccines entirely but is allowing a delayed schedule. That seems reasonable. However, the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge might mean the author is right to protect his values, but is it his fault she changed her mind?\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, ultimatums are tough. But if both parties had agreed on the principle of vaccination, maybe the author is not wrong to enforce that. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden opposition could be a deal-breaker. So, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He made a clear decision based on prior agreement and his professional background, while the fianc\u00e9e is now contradicting previous commitments. So the answer is B.\n"
