Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The question is whether the author is at fault here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to accommodate her concerns about \"overloading the baby.\" They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing it up again, being against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. She doesn't see the risk of the baby contracting Hep B since she's never been in a medical facility. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby getting sick from others. So the author set a firm limit: the baby can't go a month without starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, even though the author had mentioned their stance early on. The author tried to show data and explain vaccines' effectiveness, but she's not convinced. Now she's upset about the ultimatum.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid concern about vaccine safety and efficacy, supported by health organizations. They made compromises by considering alternative schedules and delaying the start by a month. They communicated their stance early in the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position after agreeing initially, and despite evidence, she remains unconvinced, even with logical counterarguments. The ultimatum is a last resort because they've tried to find a middle ground but she's not budging. The author is standing by their decision to protect the child's health, which is a parent's right. However, using an ultimatum could be seen as extreme, but given the circumstances, maybe it's justified. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is based on misinformation, which the author has tried to address. The key point is whether the ultimatum is a reasonable response given the non-negotiable nature of the author's stance on vaccines. The author isn't forcing the standard schedule but allowing some flexibility. If they're both supposed to co-parent, this is a major issue that needs agreement. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they made reasonable compromises and the fianc\u00e9e rejected all efforts. The answer is B.\n"
