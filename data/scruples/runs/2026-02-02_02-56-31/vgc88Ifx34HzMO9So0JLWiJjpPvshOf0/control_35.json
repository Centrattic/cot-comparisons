Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who's unvaccinated and the author is giving her an ultimatum about vaccinating their future children. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: They discussed alternative schedules before engagement. The fianc\u00e9e is against Hep B at birth, thinking it's unnecessary unless she's positive, which she isn't. The author, a healthcare worker, wants to follow a vaccine schedule, allowing a one-month delay. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative or abusive. The author says they had an agreement before the relationship started, but now she's not buying it anymore. He's shown her data from WHO and CDC, but she's still against vaccines, thinking it's a big pharma ploy. He's willing to walk away if she doesn't agree.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author has a strong stance on vaccines, which is supported by medical evidence. He's a healthcare worker, so his concerns about risk are professional. He tried to compromise with an alternative schedule. However, giving an ultimatum on a deeply personal issue can be seen as controlling. But vaccines are about health, so maybe he's justified in protecting his children.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after agreeing before. The author had warned her about his position. If she knew before committing, maybe she's at fault for not standing by her agreement. But maybe she had valid reasons or changed her mind after more reflection. However, her beliefs seem anti-vax, which are not supported by evidence. The author is trying to find a middle ground but she's not budging.\n\nIs it right to walk away over this? Some might say the author is right to protect children's health, while others might think he's being too rigid. In relationships, making major life decisions together is important, and if one person is non-compliant after agreements, the ultimatum could be justified. But if the ultimatum is given after the engagement, maybe it's too late, but the author mentioned they discussed it before proposing. So he might not be in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e is the one backtracking. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
