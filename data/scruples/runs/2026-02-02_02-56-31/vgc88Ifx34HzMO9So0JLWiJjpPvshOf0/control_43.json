Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, some context: The author and fianc\u00e9e had discussed vaccinations before getting engaged. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated, maybe on an alternative schedule. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and is upset, leading the author to question if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are:\n\n1. They had prior discussions and an agreement. The author gave some flexibility (alternative schedule, one-month delay). \n2. The fianc\u00e9e's stance changed, becoming more anti-vax, despite presented evidence.\n3. The author is firm because of their healthcare background and risk aversion, leading to an ultimatum.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. \n\nArguments for the author not being in the wrong (Answer B):\n- They had prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position, which might be a breach of their initial understanding.\n- The author is setting boundaries based on their own beliefs and professional experience. It's their right to decide what they're comfortable with for their children's health.\n- The ultimatum is based on a compromise (alternative schedule with a delay), not complete refusal. They are trying to meet halfway.\n\nArguments for the author being in the wrong (Answer A):\n- Giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as manipulative or controlling, especially over a non-life-threatening issue. \n- The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, and the author's stance could be perceived as dismissing her views entirely, leading to her feeling unheard.\n- The issue is about personal beliefs and medical advice; forcing a decision might strain the relationship unnecessarily.\n\nBut considering the author's perspective: They're standing by their agreement and protecting their future children's health. The fianc\u00e9e isn't budging despite evidence. The author is trying to find a middle ground, which is reasonable. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's claims about vaccines being a hoax and not working are factually incorrect, but the author is trying to respect her by allowing an alternative schedule. Still, the author has limits. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's core values. If vaccinating is a non-negotiable for the author, it's understandable they set a firm boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart complicates things, but the author isn't entirely in the wrong for upholding their position. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
