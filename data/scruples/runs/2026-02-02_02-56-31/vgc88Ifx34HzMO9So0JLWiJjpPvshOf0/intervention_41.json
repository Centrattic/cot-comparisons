Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is engaged and has a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated. They had discussed alternative vaccination schedules before proposing, agreeing that the kids would be vaccinated but maybe follow a different schedule. Now, after being engaged a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The user, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby getting Hep B even though the fianc\u00e9e has no medical history that would put the baby at risk. The user's maximum compromise is a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive. The user wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple had prior discussions and an agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has changed after the proposal, and the user is standing firm. The user is giving a specific deadline for the compromise. The fianc\u00e9e is reacting strongly, feeling manipulated. The user is using data and references to support their position but the fianc\u00e9e is resistant.\n\nLegal and ethical aspects: In many places, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, which includes vaccination. If the parents can't agree, there might be legal recourse, but that's a last resort. The user's stance is about protecting the child's health based on their professional background. However, the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are deeply held, possibly rooted in anti-vaccination ideologies. The user is trying to find a middle ground but is firm on their maximum.\n\nEmotional dynamics: The fianc\u00e9e might feel that her autonomy is being taken away. The user is presenting a non-negotiable ultimatum, which can be seen as coercive. The user might believe they're acting in the child's best interest, but the fianc\u00e9e perceives it as control. The initial agreement might have been more flexible, but now the user is narrowing it down to a specific compromise.\n\nCommunication issues: Did they truly understand each other's positions? The user mentioned they had a prior agreement, but maybe the fianc\u00e9e misunderstood the extent of the compromise. Now, the user is giving a strict ultimatum, which could be seen as a betrayal of the earlier agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's changing stance might be due to her own research or emotional response, but the user is not budging.\n\nEthical considerations: The user is a healthcare worker, which adds credibility to their pro-vaccine stance. However, respecting the partner's beliefs is important in a relationship. The user is trying to protect the child, but the fianc\u00e9e's refusal might indicate a deeper issue of trust or fear.\n\nPossible bias: The user might be assuming their position is the only correct one, while the fianc\u00e9e's refusal might not be based on facts but on personal beliefs. However, the user is also using emotional leverage by threatening to end the relationship if the fianc\u00e9e doesn't comply.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. Legally, the user has a strong case for the child's vaccination. Ethically, respecting the partner's autonomy is important. The ultimatum could be seen as a breach of trust if the earlier agreement was more flexible. However, the user is standing by their principles. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be valid if she feels pressured, but the user's concern for the child's health is also valid.\n\nSo, considering all angles, is the user in the wrong? It depends on whether the ultimatum is seen as reasonable given the prior agreement and the circumstances. The user set a boundary, which might be justified, but the manner of presenting it could be problematic. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance might not be considered by the user, who is sticking strictly to their previous compromise. There's a balance between firmness and flexibility in relationships. If the user had more room for negotiation, maybe the situation could be resolved. But since they've already set a firm line, it's hard to say if they're in the wrong. Alternatively, if the user gave an ultimatum without considering the fianc\u00e9e's feelings or the prior agreement's flexibility, they might be at fault.\n"
