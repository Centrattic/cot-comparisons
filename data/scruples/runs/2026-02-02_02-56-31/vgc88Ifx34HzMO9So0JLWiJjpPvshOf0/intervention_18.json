Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e about vaccinating their future children. They provided a detailed context.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before engagement. They discussed alternative schedules, agreed on some compromise. Now, after a month, she's more against vaccines, especially Hep B. The user is a healthcare worker, concerned about risks, and gives her an ultimatum: either follow an alternative schedule starting after a month or the relationship ends. She's upset, calling it manipulative. The user wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and compromise. They had prior agreement, but now she's backtracking. The user is firm on vaccines, she's against them. They tried data and arguments, but she's not budging. The ultimatum is about their future children's health. The user isn't giving her any middle ground beyond their maximum compromise.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, should someone be forced to compromise on such a core issue? If you have strong beliefs about your children's health, and the other person isn't willing to budge despite prior agreements, is it wrong to set a boundary? The user is a healthcare worker, so their stance is informed. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is based on conspiracy theories and misinformation, as per the user's description. \n\nHowever, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If she agreed before but now refuses, maybe the user should explore why there's a change. But the user has tried data, and she's not swayed. The ultimatum is a final attempt to resolve the conflict, as the user can't compromise further. \n\nIn terms of fault, if the fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to honor prior agreements and the user is standing by their stance, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking resolution. Setting boundaries in a relationship is important, especially when it comes to health decisions. The answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
