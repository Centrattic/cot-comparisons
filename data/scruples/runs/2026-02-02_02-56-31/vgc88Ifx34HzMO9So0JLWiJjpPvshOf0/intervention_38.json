Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for giving their fianc\u00e9e an ultimatum about vaccinating their future kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they knew she was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe using a different country's schedule to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The user, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks from not vaccinating, even though they're not in a medical facility. They set a limit: the baby can't wait more than a month before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive. She used to agree to work towards vaccination but now is staunchly against it, believing vaccines are a hoax and don't work. The user provided evidence, but she's not convinced. Now she's upset that he's willing to leave over this.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is at fault. Let's consider the key points. The user made it clear from the start that they wanted vaccinated kids. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards it but later changed her stance. The user offered a compromise (alternative schedule with a one-month delay), but she's not accepting it. He's standing his ground, which is about his non-negotiable on children's health. She's now giving ultimatum labels to his compromise. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the user is trying to protect their child's health, supported by medical data. The fianc\u00e9e is holding strong to misinformation, despite evidence. The user isn't forcing her to vaccinate themselves, but setting a boundary for the child. Ultimatums in relationships can be tough, but when it's about a child's well-being, it's a serious matter. The user isn't the one backing down from the agreement they had. The fianc\u00e9e is breaking the prior understanding. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. Answer B makes sense.\n"
