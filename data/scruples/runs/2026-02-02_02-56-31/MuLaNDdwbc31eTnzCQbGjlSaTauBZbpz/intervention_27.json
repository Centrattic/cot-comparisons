Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Their situation is that they've been doing this for two months in a big city. They do \"booo!\" to cat-callers, which is like mocking them. They get some negative reactions back, like curses and threats, but they're big and no one has attacked them. People they've talked to think they're an asshole. Some guys think they're a white knight, others say it makes things worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The user's intention is to discourage the behavior by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. But their method is public shaming or mocking. The question is whether this is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the user is trying to address a harmful behavior. They might believe in standing up against it. But on the other hand, their approach could escalate the situation. The people around them think it's making things worse. For example, girls think they're drawing attention, which might make victims feel more uncomfortable. Also, the heckling could provoke the cat-callers, leading to more conflict or even aggression. Even if the user is big, there's a risk someone might retaliate eventually. \n\nAdditionally, public shaming can sometimes be as negative as the original behavior. It might not lead to constructive change. Instead of addressing the root issue, it's just creating a confrontation. The user might be overstepping by inserting themselves into a situation where they're not the target. They could be seen as taking the role of a \"white knight,\" which might not be welcomed by the actual victims. \n\nAlso, the humor they find in the situation might trivialize the seriousness of cat-calling. The effectiveness is questionable\u2014whether their actions actually reduce cat-calling or just create a different problem. There might be better ways to address the issue, like reporting to authorities, supporting victims, or advocating for community awareness programs.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. While the intent is good, the method could be problematic. The user might not be in the wrong in terms of intention, but their approach could be causing more harm than good. The key is whether their actions are effective and whether they're respecting others' experiences. Since others are saying it's making things worse, there's a case to be made that they are in the wrong for how they're handling it.\n"
