Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They say they've been doing this for two months in a big city. Their main reason is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior. They get some backlash from both sides\u2014guys think they're overstepping, girls think they're making it worse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and disrespectful. The person is trying to intervene, which could be seen as a good intention. But how they're doing it\u2014by loudly booing\u2014might be seen as confrontational. \n\nThe question is whether their method is wrong. On one hand, standing up against harassment is positive. On the other, using public heckling could escalate the situation. The person mentions getting threats, which is a risk. Also, the girls' perspective is that it draws attention and makes things worse. Maybe the cat-caller is still the aggressor, but the intervenor's method could be counterproductive.\n\nAnother angle: Is it the person's place to intervene in this way? Some might argue that it's not their role, and that it could put others at risk. If the cat-caller is harassing someone else, the intervenor might be putting themselves in the way. Also, their own safety is a concern if they get attacked.\n\nBut then again, creating a culture where people feel empowered to stop bad behavior is important. The person's intention is to discourage the behavior, which is good. However, the method might not be effective. Maybe a better approach is to support the person being harassed rather than confront the harasser directly.\n\nSo, are they in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Their intention is positive, but the method has potential downsides. The answer might lean towards A (Yes) because their approach could be counterproductive and might not address the root issue. Alternatively, B (No) if supporting the idea of intervening, even if the method isn't perfect. \n\nBut considering that they're making the situation more confrontational and possibly putting themselves and others at risk, the answer might be A. However, others might argue that any intervention is better than nothing. The key point is whether their actions are effective and respectful. If the goal is to stop harassment, maybe a different approach is needed. So, probably A.\n"
