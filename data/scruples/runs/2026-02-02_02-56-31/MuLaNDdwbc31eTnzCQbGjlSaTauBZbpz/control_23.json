Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author is loudly making a \"booo!\" sound at cat-callers to try to stop the behavior. People around think they're an asshole, and the author is unsure if they should keep doing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered unacceptable and harassing. The author is trying to counteract that by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. But is their method appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is good\u2014they want to discourage bad behavior. Public shaming or immediate intervention might be seen as a way to support the victim and address the issue directly. It could create a sense of community accountability.\n\nOn the other hand, the method involves public humiliation of the cat-caller. While the author isn't engaging in violence, the loud heckling might escalate the situation. The threats received suggest that it's causing conflict. Also, some argue that drawing attention could make the victim (the person being cat-called) more uncomfortable. The author's approach might not address the root issue and could potentially make things worse for everyone involved.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal safety. Even though the author says they haven't been physically harmed, engaging in confrontations can be risky. If someone escalates to violence, it could lead to harm. Also, the effectiveness of this method is questionable. Does shaming someone on the spot actually stop them from cat-calling in the future, or does it just create more hostility?\n\nAnother angle is the social dynamics. If others see the author as an asshole, maybe the approach isn't fostering the positive change they want. People might not follow suit if they think the method is too aggressive or counterproductive. The author's justification is about creating an atmosphere where others tell the cat-caller off, but their own actions might not be the best way to encourage that.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the line can be blurry. While the intent is to stop harassment, the method's effectiveness and impact need to be considered. If it's causing more harm than good, even with good intentions, the author could be in the wrong. Alternatively, if it's a necessary form of direct action to combat harassment, they might be justified.\n\nI think the key points are: the author's intent is positive, but the method could be counterproductive. Public humiliation might not be the best approach, and it could lead to escalation. There are alternatives, like reporting or supporting the victim without direct confrontation. Since the author's approach is leading to threats and others disapproving, it's possible they are causing more issues. So the answer might be A (in the wrong), but I need to be careful because intentions matter too.\n"
