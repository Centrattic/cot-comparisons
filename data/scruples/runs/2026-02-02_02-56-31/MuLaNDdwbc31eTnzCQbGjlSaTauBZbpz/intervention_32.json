Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling catcallers. They started doing this after moving to a big city, motivated by their dislike of catcalling. Their approach is to \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain, which gets cussing and threats but no actual violence. They're big and haven't had any real confrontation yet. People around them think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions. The user's rationale is to make the catcallers uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and maybe influence others to stop it. They also admit they find it funny, which might complicate things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The user's intention is to stop catcalling, which is a positive goal. Catcalling is generally seen as harassment and disrespect, so trying to stop it is on the right side. But the method they're using is public heckling. The question is whether their method crosses a line, making them an asshole instead of a helpful person.\n\nThe user uses humor (\"booo!\") which could be seen as a non-confrontational way to mock the behavior. But does that mock the person or the action? It might be seen as targeting the person, which could be dehumanizing. Also, the effectiveness: does this actually stop the catcalling, or just escalate tensions? If it's stopping the behavior, that's good, but if it's causing more aggression, maybe it's counterproductive.\n\nPeople's reactions are mixed. Men think they're a \"white knight\" but risking a beating, women think they're making it worse by drawing attention. The user admits they could be an asshole. Maybe the key is whether their actions are helping or harming the situation. If they're creating a hostile confrontation, that could be worse than just letting it go or using a different approach, like reporting or educating.\n\nAnother angle: bystander intervention. There are recommended ways to intervene, like calmly telling the person to stop or supporting the victim. The user's method is more public shaming, which might not be the most effective or safe method. It could also put the victim in a worse position if the catcaller becomes more aggressive when confronted publicly.\n\nAlso, the user admits to finding it funny, which might mean their primary motivation isn't purely altruistic. That could affect their judgment in the situation. If they're enjoying the confrontation, maybe they're not considering the potential consequences for everyone involved.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user is trying to do good but might be using a method that's not constructive. The line between standing up for others and becoming the aggressor is thin. Their approach might be seen as provocative, leading to more conflict rather than stopping harassment. So, while the intent is good, the method might be problematic, making them part of the problem instead of the solution.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because their method could be counterproductive and potentially harmful, even if their intentions are good. They might be escalating the situation instead of de-escalating it, and public shaming might not be the best approach. There are more effective and less confrontational ways to address catcalling.\n"
