Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They've been doing it for two months in a big city. Their method is to \"booo\" like a villain in a silent movie when they see catcalling. The responses they get are mostly negative from others, with some people calling them an asshole. The user's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Catcalling is generally seen as harassment and is inappropriate. The user is trying to address this by publicly shaming the offenders. But the question is whether their method is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, they're standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. Their action might help in deterring the behavior, especially if it makes the cat-caller feel that their actions are not socially acceptable. It could also support the person being harassed by showing solidarity.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's method involves direct confrontation, which might escalate the situation. The cat-callers responded with threats and curses, indicating that the interaction becomes more confrontational. The user acknowledges that others, both men and women, think they're being an asshole. Women's feedback is particularly important here\u2014some believe the user is drawing more attention to the situation, which could make the victim feel worse. Also, using humor (\"I find it funny\") might trivialize a serious issue like harassment.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for public shaming. While the goal is good, the method could lead to unintended consequences. If the heckling turns into a spectacle, it might not be helping the victim but rather adding to the discomfort. Also, the user's size and the fact that others haven't physically confronted them yet doesn't mean it's the best approach. Safety is a concern if the situation escalates.\n\nThere's also the aspect of whether it's the user's place to intervene. Some might argue that intervening is commendable, but others might say it's better to report such incidents to authorities rather than handle it personally. The user's method could be seen as vigilantism, which has its own issues.\n\nConsidering the feedback from others\u2014both men and women\u2014it seems that while the intention is good, the method is not universally accepted. Women's concerns about making the situation worse are significant because the primary goal should be to support the victim without causing them additional stress. If the heckling draws attention, it might cause the victim to feel more embarrassed or targeted, even if the intention is to help.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the principle of non-maleficence (do no harm) is important. Even though the user wants to prevent harm (harassment), their method could cause other types of harm, such as confrontation or embarrassment to the victim if they're drawn into the situation. It's possible that the intervention is not the most effective or considerate way to address the issue.\n\nAlternative approaches might include advocating for better city policies against harassment, supporting organizations that work on this issue, or educating others about the impact of catcalling. These methods might be more sustainable and less likely to escalate tensions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intent is to reduce harassment, the method they're using could be counterproductive. The potential for making the situation worse, especially for the victim, and the negative reactions from others suggest that they might be in the wrong. The answer might lean towards A (Yes, they are in the wrong), but there's a nuanced consideration here. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and given the possible negative consequences despite good intentions, the answer is likely A.\n"
