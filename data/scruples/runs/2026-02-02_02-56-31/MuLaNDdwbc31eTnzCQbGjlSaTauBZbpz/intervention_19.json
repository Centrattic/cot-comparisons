Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: they moved to a big city and started loudly \"booo!\" at cat-callers. Their reason is that they hate catcalling and want to stop it by making the offenders uncomfortable. They get some negative reactions but feel justified. Others think they're causing more attention or being an asshole. They want to know if they're wrong.\n\nHmm. Catcalling is a form of harassment, so it's a valid issue to address. But the method they're using is public heckling. On one hand, it's a way to show solidarity with the victim and discourage the behavior. On the other hand, maybe it's escalating the situation. The user mentions that the cat-caller gets angry and sometimes threatens them, but the user is confident they can handle it.\n\nThe user's rationale is about creating a deterrent effect. That's a common argument for taking direct action. But others argue it might draw more attention to the victim or make the situation worse. For example, if the cat-caller gets defensive or more aggressive because of the heckling, could that put someone at more risk?\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The user says others think they're an asshole. Some people might see this as a bold stand against harassment, while others might think it's not their place to intervene. Also, the user admits to finding it funny, which could come across as insensitivity, even if their intentions are good.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Legally, unless they're inciting violence, they might not be in the wrong. Ethically, it's more nuanced. While the intent is to stop harassment, the method could have unintended consequences. For instance, if the heckling leads to a confrontation where someone gets hurt, that would be problematic. But in the user's case, no one has acted on the threats yet.\n\nAnother angle is bystander intervention. There's research that shows standing up to harassment can be effective. However, the approach matters. A direct \"booo\" might be seen as disruptive but not necessarily harmful. However, if it's causing a scene, maybe it's not the best method.\n\nThe user's size and confidence play a role. They feel they can handle any retaliation, which reduces the risk of harm to themselves. But others might not be in the same position, so maybe it's not a universally good approach.\n\nIn summary, the user's intention is positive, but the method could be debatable. While their actions aim to stop harassment, the potential to escalate the situation or draw unwanted attention is a downside. The judgment here depends on the context and the effectiveness of the approach. But since they're asking if they're in the wrong, it's a balance between their good intentions and the possible negative outcomes.\n"
