Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. Their reasoning is that they want to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. But people around think they're an asshole, with some thinking it makes the situation worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and disrespectful, so the user's intention to stop it is understandable. But their method is to heckle, which might have unintended consequences. The user says they get cussed at and threats, but they're big and no one has acted on it yet. \n\nNow, the key points: Is their action justified? On one hand, they're trying to address a problem. On the other, their approach could escalate the situation. For instance, drawing attention might make the victim feel more embarrassed or in danger. Also, some people think it's making things worse. The user's humor and personal satisfaction might not align with the effectiveness or appropriateness of the action. \n\nBut then, maybe public shaming could deter others. However, there's a risk of confrontation. If someone is being cat-called, adding a loud heckle could put them in a more vulnerable position if the harasser becomes aggressive. Also, the user's approach might not be the best way to support the victim. Maybe a safer approach is to report the behavior or support the person being harassed, rather than confront the harasser directly in a way that could escalate conflict.\n\nThe user's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others stop the behavior. But is their method effective? Studies or common advice on bystander intervention suggest that direct confrontation can sometimes lead to more harm. The recommended approach is often to support the victim and report to authorities, not to engage in public shaming which can backfire.\n\nSo, while the user's intent is good, the method might not be the best. It's possible they are in the wrong because their approach could make the situation worse for the person being harassed and might not be an effective deterrent. The answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because their method could cause more harm, even if the intention is good.\n"
