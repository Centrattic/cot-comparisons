Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author has been doing this for two months in a big city. His method is to boo like a silent movie villain, which sometimes leads to curses or threats from the cat-callers. He mentions that both men and women think he's an asshole, but he believes his actions might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and disrespectful, so intervening could be seen as standing up against harassment. However, the method he's using\u2014publicly shaming the cat-callers with loud heckling\u2014might have its downsides. \n\nThe author's rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable, potentially discouraging them. But some argue that it draws more attention to the situation, which could make the victim more uncomfortable. The author acknowledges this possibility. Also, he mentions that people think he's being an asshole, but he's doing it partly because he finds it funny. That might not be the best motivation for such actions.\n\nOn one hand, he's trying to address a problem. On the other, his approach might not be the most effective or considerate. Public shaming can escalate situations, and there's a risk of making the victim feel more targeted. Plus, the author is using threats of confrontation to deter others, which could lead to physical altercations if someone actually goes through with it. \n\nAnother angle: the author is a big person and hasn't faced physical consequences yet, but that doesn't mean it's safe for others. Also, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Legally, he might not be doing anything illegal, but ethically, it's a gray area. \n\nIf the goal is to create a culture where others stop the behavior, maybe a more constructive approach would be better, like directly confronting the cat-caller politely or supporting the victim. However, the author's method could be a form of non-violent protest. \n\nBut the fact that people around him think he's an asshole is a point. If he's making the situation more uncomfortable for everyone, that's a problem. Also, his own enjoyment (\"I find it funny\") might not align with the seriousness of the issue. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are to stop harassment, the method he uses could be counterproductive and potentially harmful. He might be in the wrong because his approach could escalate tensions and not address the root issue effectively. So answer A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no). Hmm. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the means justify the ends. If the intention is good, but the method is flawed, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the method is part of the problem, then he is. Given that he's using ridicule and it's causing conflict, maybe A. But others might argue that any intervention is better. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the title is \"AITA,\" the author is seeking validation. If the community generally thinks he's an asshole, but others might support him. \n\nGiven the conflicting perspectives, but considering that public shaming can be harmful and that the author is perhaps overstepping by making it a joke, the answer might be A. However, some might say B because he's opposing harassment. It's a tough call. The author's actions could be seen as well-intentioned but misguided. So maybe answer A.\n"
