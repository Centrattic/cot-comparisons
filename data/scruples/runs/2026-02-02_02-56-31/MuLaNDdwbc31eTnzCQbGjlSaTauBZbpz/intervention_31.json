Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're loudly heckling cat-callers in a big city. They started doing this because they hate cat-calling and want to discourage it. Their method is making a loud \"booo!\" sound like a villain in a silent movie. People are reacting with curses and threats, but the person is big and no one has actually attacked them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics. Cat-calling is generally seen as a negative behavior, so trying to stop it could be seen as good. But the method here is public heckling. The person argues that making the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller might discourage them. But others think they're drawing attention and making it worse. \n\nOn one hand, intervening to stop harassment can be positive. It supports the person being harassed and might set an example. On the other hand, public confrontation can escalate the situation. The heckler might provoke the cat-caller further, leading to more aggression. Also, if the heckler is seen as creating a scene, it might make the situation more uncomfortable for everyone involved. \n\nAnother angle: the person is taking the law into their own hands. While their intention is good, they're not in a position to enforce social norms through direct confrontation. It could be argued that this is a form of vigilantism. Also, the threats they receive show that their actions are causing conflict. Even if they're not being physically attacked, verbal threats are a sign of tension.\n\nThe person's justification is that they're trying to create a better environment. But does their method actually help? It might make the cat-caller feel attacked, but does that stop the behavior? Maybe, maybe not. Meanwhile, the person being cat-called might now also have to deal with the heckler's presence, which could be distracting or even uncomfortable if the heckler is overdoing it.\n\nAlso, the person acknowledges that others think they're an asshole. Both men and women have different opinions, but the common thread is that the person is seen as causing more attention. The girls think it's making things worse, which is a valid concern because cat-calling is often about power dynamics, and drawing attention could escalate the aggressor's behavior.\n\nIn terms of personal safety, even though the heckler is big and hasn't been hurt, the threats are still a risk. It's possible that in a different encounter, someone might escalate to violence. So there's a personal risk involved too.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: the intention is good, but the method might be counterproductive. The action is causing conflict and could be making the situation worse instead of better. The person might not be in the wrong for having good intentions, but their actions could be harmful. So the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because their approach is causing more issues rather than solving the problem.\n"
