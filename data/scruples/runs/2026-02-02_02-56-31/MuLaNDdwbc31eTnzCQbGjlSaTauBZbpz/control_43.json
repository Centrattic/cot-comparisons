Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They want a yes or no answer with A being yes and B being no.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is responding to cat-calling by making loud noises like \"booo!\" to mock the perpetrators. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. The cat-callers get angry, sometimes threatening them, but the author is physically imposing so no one has acted on it. \n\nPeople around think they're an asshole. Men think they're being a white knight and might get hurt, women think they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-callers uncomfortable might deter them and create a culture where others can intervene. They also admit they find it funny, which complicates their motives.\n\nTo determine if they're in the wrong, I need to consider the ethics and social norms. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, so the author is trying to address a negative behavior. However, their method involves confrontation and public shaming. Is this appropriate?\n\nPublic shaming can escalate tensions. Even if the author's intent is to stop harassment, using mockery might not be the most effective approach. The cat-caller is already violating social norms; adding public humiliation could be seen as justified, but it might also lead to violence or make the victim feel more targeted. The author mentions that women think it makes the situation worse, which is a valid concern. If the heckling draws more attention, the victim might feel like they have to deal with both the harassment and the heckler's actions.\n\nAdditionally, the author's admission that they find it funny suggests a motive beyond just stopping harassment, which could be seen as insincere or self-serving. This might reduce the effectiveness of their intervention as a deterrent and could come across as performative.\n\nHowever, the alternative is inaction. The author is trying to do something about a problem. If their method is non-violent and doesn't escalate beyond words, some might argue it's a legitimate form of protest. The key is whether the heckling causes more harm than good.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, there's a debate between direct action and passive observation. The author is taking a proactive stance, which can be admirable, but the method might not be the best. It's a balance between addressing the problem and respecting other people's experiences. Since the author is not physically harming anyone, but their actions could potentially make situations more volatile, it's a nuanced situation.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer isn't black and white. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the fact that their method might inadvertently make things worse for the victims, as well as potentially escalating conflicts, might tip the scales towards them being in the wrong. So the answer would be A: Yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
