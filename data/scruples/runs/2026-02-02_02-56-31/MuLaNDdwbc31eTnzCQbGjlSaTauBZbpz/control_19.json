Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who loudly heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. They do this by making a loud \"booo!\" sound when cat-calling happens, which sometimes leads to threats but they feel they're discouraging the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Cat-calling is generally considered unacceptable and disrespectful. The author is trying to stand up against it, which seems positive. But their method could be problematic. Using a \"booo!\" like a villain in a silent movie might be seen as mocking or drawing attention, which could escalate the situation. The author mentions that both men and women have different reactions. Men think he's a \"white knight\" risking a beating, while women think he's making it worse by drawing attention. \n\nIs there a right or wrong way to address cat-calling? Intervening is good, but the method matters. The author's approach might not be the safest or most effective. For example, confronting the cat-caller directly or reporting it to authorities might be more constructive. By using a loud \"booo!\", they're inserting themselves into a potentially volatile situation, which could put everyone involved at risk. Also, making a spectacle might not discourage the cat-caller but instead make the victim uncomfortable. \n\nThe author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable, but the effectiveness of this isn't clear. Maybe the cat-caller isn't even aware they're being criticized. Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which could be seen as using the situation for amusement rather than genuine intervention. \n\nLegal and social norms: In some places, publicly challenging someone could lead to legal issues if it incites violence. The author mentions threats but hasn't faced physical confrontation yet. However, promoting an atmosphere of peer pressure against cat-calling is a good idea, but the method here is questionable.\n\nIn summary, while the intent is positive, the method might be causing more harm. The author could be in the wrong because their approach might not be effective, could escalate tensions, and may not align with the best ways to support victims. So, Answer A (Yes) seems appropriate.\n"
