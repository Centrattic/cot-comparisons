Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author describes their actions as loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers, which has led to some backlash but they think it might discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. But the question is about whether the author is wrong in their approach.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal. However, their method involves public confrontation, which can escalate the situation. The author mentions that this leads to curses and threats, which might not be helpful. Also, some people think it draws more attention and makes things worse. \n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness of public shaming. It's debatable whether making the situation uncomfortable for the cat-caller actually stops the behavior or just creates tension. Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might make others question their motives.\n\nBut the author isn't the one initiating harassment. They're responding to an existing problem. However, their method could be seen as escalating the conflict rather than resolving it. There's also the aspect of personal safety\u2014though the author says they're a big person and no one has acted on threats, it's still a risk.\n\nConsidering societal norms, while cat-calling is wrong, the response should ideally promote a respectful environment. Public heckling might not be the most constructive approach. Maybe a better solution would be to address it through community guidelines or reporting to authorities. \n\nSo, the author's intentions are good, but the method might be problematic. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because their approach could be counterproductive and potentially harmful, even if the goal is positive.\n"
