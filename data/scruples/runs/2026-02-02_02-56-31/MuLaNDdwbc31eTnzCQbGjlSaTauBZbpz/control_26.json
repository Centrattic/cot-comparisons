Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has been loudly \"booo!\"ing cat-callers in a big city. The author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, while others think they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to address it, which is a good intention. But how they're doing it might be the issue. Using loud heckling could escalate the situation instead of de-escalating. The author mentions getting cussed at and threats, which shows the cat-callers are reacting negatively. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author's method is acceptable. On one hand, the intention is to stop harassment, which is positive. On the other hand, the method might be confrontational and could potentially make things worse. For example, if the author is making noise, it might draw more attention to the situation, as some people (women) have said. Also, the author is in a big city, where such interactions might be more common, but does that justify public confrontation?\n\nAnother angle: the author is using humor or mockery (\"booo! like a silent movie villain\") which might not be the best approach. Cat-calling is a serious issue, and mocking the perpetrators might not address the root problem. Also, the author is a \"big fucker\" and hasn't faced physical consequences yet, but that doesn't mean it's safe or right. What if someone does attack them? The author might be putting themselves at risk.\n\nLegal perspective? In many places, cat-calling is a form of harassment, but the author's actions aren't illegal. However, if the heckling leads to a physical altercation, then it could become a legal issue. But the question is about being in the wrong ethically or morally, not legally.\n\nAlternatives: Instead of heckling, the author could support systemic changes, educate others, or use non-confrontational methods. But the author's approach is direct. However, direct confrontation can sometimes lead to more conflict. The effectiveness of the method is debatable. The author does feel it's helping create an atmosphere where others might intervene, which is a positive outcome, but if it's causing more tension, maybe it's not the best way.\n\nPublic opinion: The author says that people who observe think they're an asshole. Both men and women criticize the approach. That's a red flag. Even if the intention is good, the public perception is negative. Maybe the method is causing more harm than good.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention is commendable, the method of loudly heckling might be counterproductive. Drawing attention, escalating the situation, and being perceived as an asshole by others suggests that the author is in the wrong. The right approach might involve more subtle or constructive methods that don't involve confrontation and potential escalation.\n"
