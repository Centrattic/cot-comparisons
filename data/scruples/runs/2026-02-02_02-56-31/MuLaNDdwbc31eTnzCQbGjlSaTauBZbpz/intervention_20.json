Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They started doing this after moving to a big city, and their main reasoning is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. They mention that others think they're an asshole, with some thinking they're a \"white knight\" or that they're making things worse by drawing attention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of their actions. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and inappropriate. The user is trying to address this by publicly shaming the perpetrators. But is their method effective or counterproductive? \n\nOn one hand, publicly calling out someone might escalate the situation, making it more confrontational. This could potentially put the user at risk, even though they mention they're a \"big fucker\" and no one has acted on threats yet. However, relying on physical presence to deter confrontation isn't a sustainable solution and might lead to a dangerous situation eventually.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's intention is to discourage harassment, which is a laudable goal. But methods matter. Public shaming can sometimes lead to the shamed person becoming defensive or aggressive, which might not help the situation. Also, by drawing attention, the user might be making the victims (the people being cat-called) more uncomfortable, as the focus shifts to the confrontation rather than supporting the victims.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for bystander intervention. Effective strategies often involve non-confrontational methods, like reporting to authorities or supporting the victim discreetly. The user's approach is direct and loud, which might not align with best practices for de-escalation.\n\nAlso, the user's own safety is a factor. Even if they haven't faced physical consequences yet, threatening words can escalate. The fact that others see them as an asshole suggests that their method isn't widely accepted as the right approach, which might indicate a cultural or social misstep.\n\nSo, weighing these points: the user has good intentions but their method could be harmful. Public heckling might not be the best approach because it can escalate tensions, doesn't directly support the victims, and could lead to personal harm. The right approach might involve more supportive, non-confrontational strategies. Therefore, the answer would be that they are in the wrong (A) because their method is counterproductive despite the good intentions.\n"
