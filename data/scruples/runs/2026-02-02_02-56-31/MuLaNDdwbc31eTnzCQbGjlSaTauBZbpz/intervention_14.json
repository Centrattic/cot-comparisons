Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They started doing this in a big city, using a loud \"booo!\" like a movie villain. People react with curses and threats, but they haven't faced actual harm. Others think they're an asshole, with some support from guys and criticism from women. Their reasoning is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to deter future behavior and create a better atmosphere.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if their actions are justified. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment, so addressing it is a positive intent. However, their method involves public confrontation, which could escalate the situation. The user's approach might be seen as vigilantism. While their goal is good, the method could be problematic. Public shaming might lead to more conflict rather than resolving the issue. Also, the user mentions that others, including women, think they're making things worse by drawing attention. This suggests that their method might not be effective or could even be counterproductive. The user is aware of potential threats but feels confident due to their size. However, safety is a concern here. The question is whether their actions cross the line into being an asshole. The answer depends on balancing intent versus impact. Even if the intent is good, if the action causes more harm or discomfort, it might be wrong. Since the user is causing conflict and others disagree on the approach, it's likely they are in the wrong. So, answer A.\n"
