Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The scenario is that they're in a big city, have been doing this for two months, and their method is making loud \"booo\" sounds like a silent movie villain. They get some negative responses but don't back down. People around think they're an asshole, with men seeing them as a \"white knight\" and women thinking it makes things worse. The user's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and harassing. The user's intention is to stop it, which is a good motive. But their method is public heckling. The question is whether their approach is justified or if they're overstepping.\n\nOn one hand, standing up against harassment is commendable. The user is trying to create a safer environment, which is a positive goal. However, the method of loud heckling might escalate the situation. By drawing attention, they could potentially make the victim more uncomfortable or even draw more attention to them. Also, the cat-caller might react aggressively, putting everyone in danger. The user mentions that people around them think they're an asshole, which suggests that their approach isn't universally accepted.\n\nAnother angle is the user's own justification. They argue that if they make the cat-caller uncomfortable, it might prevent future incidents. That's a utilitarian approach\u2014maximizing good by reducing harm. But does their method actually address the root issue? Maybe not. It might just create a confrontational situation without resolving the underlying problem. Also, the user admits they find it funny, which could imply a lack of seriousness about the harassment.\n\nThe responses from others are mixed. Men think they're a \"white knight,\" which might mean they see the user as overstepping or trying to play hero. Women think it's making the situation worse, perhaps because it could draw more attention to the victims or escalate tensions. The user is physically capable and hasn't faced physical consequences yet, but that doesn't mean it's safe or appropriate.\n\nIn terms of morality, the user's intent matters, but so does the method. While the intention is good, the execution might not be effective or respectful. It could be argued that intervening in a non-confrontational way, like reporting to authorities or using a more discreet method, would be better. Alternatively, supporting the victim without causing further distress might be more appropriate.\n\nAnother consideration is the legal aspect. In some places, publicly shaming someone could lead to legal issues if it's considered harassment. The threats the user receives might also indicate that their actions are provoking a negative response, which could have consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intentions are to combat harassment, their method of public heckling might not be the best approach. It could inadvertently harm the situation by drawing attention away from the victim or escalating conflict. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong because their method lacks consideration for the potential negative impacts, even if their intentions are good.\n"
