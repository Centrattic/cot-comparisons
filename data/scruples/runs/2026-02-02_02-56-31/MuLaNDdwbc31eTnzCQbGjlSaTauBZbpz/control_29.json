Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author is making a case for why they do it, but others think they're being an asshole. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that by making the cat-caller uncomfortable, they might discourage such behavior. That sounds like a good intention. Also, creating an atmosphere where others can intervene could help. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong, not just the intention.\n\nOn the other hand, people think they're causing more attention. Cat-calling is already inappropriate, but responding with loud heckling might escalate the situation. The author is getting threats, which could lead to physical confrontations. Even if they're big and no one has acted on the threats yet, the risk is there. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they find it funny. Maybe that's part of the problem. If the primary motivation is humor rather than serious intent to stop harassment, that could be seen as insincere. Girls think it's making things worse by drawing attention. That's a valid concern because it might put the victim in a more uncomfortable situation. \n\nBut then again, bystander intervention is encouraged in some contexts. However, the method here is loud heckling, which isn't a typical or recommended approach. The cat-caller's behavior is wrong, but the response might not be measured. The author's actions could be seen as confrontational, which might not help the situation and could lead to more conflict.\n\nSo, the author's intentions are good, but the method might be problematic. They might be causing more harm than good. People disagree, but the fact that others think they're an asshole suggests that their approach isn't universally accepted. It's a tricky situation where intentions are good but the execution could be better. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their method could be making the situation worse, even if their intent is to help.\n"
