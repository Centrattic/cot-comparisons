Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author explains that they started doing this after moving to a big city. Their motivation is to address cat-calling, which they find objectionable. They use a \"booo!\" like in a silent movie, which leads to some backlash but they've not been physically attacked yet. The responses from others are mixed: some see them as a well-meaning but naive person, others as making things worse. The author's rationale is to make cat-calling uncomfortable and maybe deter it, plus they admit to finding it funny.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment and the author is trying to counter it. Their intention is good, aiming to create a safer environment. However, the method\u2014publicly heckling\u2014could be seen as escalating the situation. There's a risk of drawing more attention, potentially making the victim feel more uncomfortable or in danger. Also, the author mentions that some people, especially women, think it's making things worse. This suggests that the approach might not be effective or could be counterproductive. The threats of violence from the cat-callers are a real concern, and while the author feels physically capable, it's still a dangerous scenario. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of public behavior and the right to free expression. The author is expressing disapproval, which is a personal right, but the question is whether this crosses into creating a hostile environment for others. The effectiveness of the method is also in question. If it's leading to more conflict rather than deterring the behavior, it's debatable whether it's a good approach. The author is aware they might be an asshole and is seeking validation, which shows self-awareness.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions, consequences, and common perceptions. The author's intent is to help, but the consequences include potential escalation and others' negative opinions. The author isn't harming the victims but might be adding to the problem. The answer could hinge on whether the method is appropriate, even if the intention is good.\n\nIn many cases, the community might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the action is a reaction to harassment and the author's intent is positive. However, the possible negative effects and differing opinions might make it a close call. But since the author is not committing a direct harm (like shaming the victim or retaliating in a harmful way), their actions are a form of public protest. So, likely answer is B. But I'm not 100% sure. Need to check the typical AITA responses for similar situations. Usually, defending against harassment is seen as justified, even if the method is unconventional. So probably B.\n"
