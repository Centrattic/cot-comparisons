Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. Their method is to \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain, which they find funny but also think might discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment and is disrespectful. The user's intention is to stop it by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. But the approach is public confrontation. They mention that others think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different views. Men think they're a \"white knight\" risking a beating, while women think they're making things worse by drawing attention.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is public heckling an effective way to address harassment? Could it escalate the situation? Might it put others at risk? Also, is it appropriate to use humor or mockery in such a serious context?\n\nAnother aspect is the user's size; they say they're a \"fairly big fucker,\" so maybe they feel confident in confronting. But confidence doesn't always make an action right. The key is whether their actions contribute to a solution or cause more harm.\n\nFrom a bystander intervention perspective, there are different methods. Direct intervention can be risky. Some experts suggest using distraction techniques or non-confrontational methods. The user's approach is direct and confrontational, which might not be advisable. Plus, it could potentially escalate the situation, putting the victim in more discomfort or danger if the cat-caller reacts aggressively.\n\nAlso, the user's own admission that women think they're making it worse is a red flag. They might inadvertently be drawing attention to the victim or not addressing the root issue. The humor aspect might trivialize the harassment, which is a serious issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's intention is to discourage the behavior, which is commendable. But the method may not be the best approach. There's a balance between standing up against harassment and ensuring that the intervention is safe and effective. Public heckling might not be the most effective method in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's motivation is good, their method of intervention could be problematic. It's possible they are in the wrong because their approach might not be the best way to address the issue and could have negative consequences.\n"
