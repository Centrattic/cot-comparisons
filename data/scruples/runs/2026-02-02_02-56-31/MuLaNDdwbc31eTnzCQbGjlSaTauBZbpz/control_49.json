Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author is loud, using \"booo!\" to mock the cat-caller, and some people are responding with threats. The author's reasoning is that they want to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. Others think they're an asshole, either because they're being a \"white knight\" or making the situation worse by drawing attention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of intervening in such situations. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, so the author's intention is to stop it. But the method they're using is public mockery. On one hand, stopping harassment is good. On the other, the author is adding their own form of confrontation, which might escalate things. The author mentions getting cursed at and threatened, but claims they're physically intimidating so no one acts on it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the cat-caller is doing something wrong, then the author is trying to correct it. However, the method\u2014loud heckling\u2014could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment. But maybe the author's actions are a form of solidarity with the victim rather than making it worse. The other perspective is that the author is not the best person to police the situation, which might be the job of authorities or the victim themselves.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges hypocrisy since they dislike cat-calling but their approach might be causing more issues. The people around them have mixed opinions. Some see them as a white knight, others as making it worse. The author's own admission that they find it funny complicates their motives. If it's more about personal amusement than genuine concern, that could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it depends on the impact. If the heckling effectively stops the harassment without causing harm, maybe it's justified. But if it leads to escalation or puts others at risk, then it's not. The author isn't getting hurt, but the cat-callers are being confronted. However, the author isn't the victim here. Maybe the appropriate response is to support the victim's choice to handle it or report the harassment rather than a bystander taking matters into their own hands. Public confrontation can have unintended consequences, like making the victim feel more uncomfortable or drawing more attention to the harassment.\n\nSo, weighing the pros and cons, the author's intention is good, but the method could be harmful. They might be overstepping by taking on the role of enforcer. The answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because their approach could be counterproductive and potentially harmful, even if the intent is noble. Alternatively, if it's seen as helping to create a culture against harassment, then B (not in the wrong). But considering that it's a public confrontation that might not be requested by the victim and could escalate, A seems more likely.\n"
