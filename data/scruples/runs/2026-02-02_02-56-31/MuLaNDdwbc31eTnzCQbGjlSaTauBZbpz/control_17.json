Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has started to loudly \"booo!\" at cat-callers as a way to discourage the behavior. They mention that this has been going on for two months and they've faced some backlash, like cussing and threats but no actual harm. The question is whether they're an asshole for doing this.\n\nThe author's rationale is that making the cat-callers uncomfortable might discourage them, and they want to create an atmosphere where others also tell the cat-callers to stop. However, others around them think they're an asshole\u2014both men and women have different opinions. Men think they're a \"white knight\" who's asking for trouble, while women think they're making things worse by drawing attention.\n\nNow, the key here is to assess whether the author's actions are justified or not. Cat-calling is generally considered unacceptable behavior, so the intent here is noble. But the method of response could be problematic. Publicly shaming someone through loud heckling might escalate the situation. It's possible that by drawing attention, they're putting others in a potentially uncomfortable or unsafe situation. Also, the threats the author receives suggest that their actions might provoke aggression, which could lead to actual harm even if it hasn't happened yet.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. The author believes they're helping by creating a deterrent, but there's no evidence provided that this method is effective. It's possible that the cat-callers might continue despite the heckling, or that the heckling could make them more defiant. Also, if the target of the cat-calling (usually a woman) is present, drawing attention to the situation might make her more uncomfortable or put her in a worse position.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal. If their method is non-violent and only involves vocal disapproval, it's a form of direct action. However, the line between standing up against harassment and becoming a harasser oneself is thin. If the heckling is disruptive or aggressive, it could be seen as crossing that line.\n\nThere's also the aspect of public order. In some places, loud public disturbances could lead to legal issues, though the author hasn't mentioned any such problems yet. However, the question here is more about moral responsibility rather than legal.\n\nConsidering the responses from others\u2014both men and women thinking the author is an asshole\u2014there's a social perception issue. The author's approach might not be universally supported, and it's possible that their method isn't the most effective or appropriate. The fact that women think it's making the situation worse is particularly important because they are often the primary victims of cat-calling. If the author's actions inadvertently cause them more distress, that's a significant drawback.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is good, the method might be counterproductive or harmful. Publicly shaming in this way could escalate tensions and potentially put others at risk. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their approach, despite good intentions, could lead to negative outcomes and isn't the most effective way to address the issue. They might need to consider alternative methods, like reporting incidents to authorities or supporting broader societal changes rather than direct confrontation.\n"
